the lunch buffet from
to pm is crazy delicious
weekend buffet is dollars a person
try a little bit of this and that
take what you want
leave what you don't
great food
good service
i recently went to their odana rd location on_the_west_side for dinner and the food was still very
very good
but the price was nuts
so stick with the lunch buffet and you will have happy belly and happy wallet
one of a select few good places to eat on the far east_side of town
i mean come on
between a bunch of chain restaurants flanking the mall and maharaja
there's no comparison
love lunch buffet
and you can in fact grab a solid dinner as well
perfect dinner for two
samosas
ginger naan
bainghan bartha
mashed grilled eggplant mmm
and mango chicken curry
the service is very courteous for dinner
they drop your napkin in your lap and you get a hot steaming towel after your meal
extra points for the extremely bass heavy hip hop gospel music coming through the wall from now faith ministries next_door
they have one helluva sound system
if that's not your sort of thing
then avoid typical church hours
excellent lunch buffet
quick service
love_this_place
their_lunch_buffet is great
so is their dinner menu
my partner and i went there for dinner on new years eve and for valentines day
we had so much fun
it is a relaxed atmosphere and they have great food
i recommend the tikki_masala
tired of
phone it in
lunch_buffets
with the same dishes day after day
then maharaja might get you out of your funk
i've been to their_lunch_buffet about times
and every time there is a new dish or two that i've_never_seen before
great price on the lunch
wonderful dessert selection
good variety between meaty and veggie dishes
love the goat_curry
if you like indian food at all
you can't_go_wrong with a lunch at maharaja
and for facebookers
no
i did not eat times tonight
just catching up on some restaurants that deserve a good review
the buffet is ok
but i came back for dinner and the specific items are very good
i had a vegetable_korma and a chickpea_curry
samosas were super
chutney could have been a bit spicyer
but hotness on the food at medium was quite good
go here for dinner
yum
they had as special
entrees
nan
rice and popadom for
i have drove past this place a thousand times
and never realized it was even here
i didn't discover my deep and passionate love of nepalese food until moving up to the twin cities
but over break my dearest mother suggested we go to the maharaja on the east_side
on the east_side
i scoffed
foolishly
there is nothing but chain food and malls on the east_side
i know this statement fairly well
as we grew_up minutes east of the east_side of madison
making a trip downtown quite a hike
but she assured me that it was in fact on the east_side
and not on the east_side like
ella's deli is on the east_side
this thing is on the east_side as in east towne mall is on the east_side
so
reluctantly
i went in
and was greeted with awesome
this buffet was amazing
they had a coconut soup which was great
all of the chicken dishes were great
they had a wide_variety of veg dishes
i was so stunned and amazed
even though i didn't partake
they served strawberry lassi
mmm
finished off with some mango_ice_cream
i couldn't have been more impressed
whenever i visit home
i always drag my family along to maharaja
delicious
and a good price
all the staff are very friendly too
this is it the cream of the crop
i've lived in the madison area for the past two years
have visited many of the local indian_buffets
and have found none that equal the maharaja standard
buffet dishes change on a daily basis
but you can always count on their show stopping chicken_tikka_masala to be in the mix
in addition to the standard meat curries and tandoori_chicken
they always offer multiple vegetarian_dishes and an array of appetizers
recommendations
coconut soup
vegetable_korma
malai_kofta
baingan bhartha
chicken_tikka_masala
mango_ice_cream
the staff is wonderful and always keeps plates of naan a plenty
maharaja is by far one of madison's best restaurants
and
you_can't_beat their_lunch_buffet deal
under
but diners beware
it is incredibly easy to overeat at this place
forcing one into an almost immediate food coma upon settling the check
this place had its awards placed up near the entrance
so they can say they're awesome
but
these awards are outdated
remember one that was dated back in
no yet
ha
had the tandoori_chicken and the lamb_curry
the lamb_curry was awesome
although not enough lamb chunks
the tandoori was excellent and spicy
had a side order of naan too
delicious
but expect_to_pay a good amount
its quite good and the awards don't lie
the staff here make the experience
since i am not a fan of buffets
i can only tell you about the meals here
delicious
i don't eat meat
my boyfriend almost only eats meat
we both found things we loved
it was the best
we liked to eat here once a week since it was so amazing
i'm not usually a fan of buffets
but maharajah's lunch buffet was quite enjoyable
i tried small amounts of a variety_of_dishes and sauces and all were tasty
their stuffed eggplant special and goat_curry were super
the food seemed to be recently made as it was not dried_out or overcooked
sorry i am indian and as a indian this place blows
their aloo parathas are a cop out the just use samosa filling for the stuffing
the spicy pickles are from a can
also their vegetable_curry is made with frozen vegetables not fresh
also i know its not a authentic place when the serve beef
no authentic place will ever serve beef
they will serve goat
lamb
chicken and every animal except beef
what else
oh yea two of the servers started chewing each other out in the back of the room where everyone could here
also they should invest in making
chaat
food street_food of india
they had none of that one the menu
i will give it star because the garlic_naan was good
also our waiter was really nice it was some guy who moved here from sd
save your indian food craving and head down to chicago
i am not sure what i like for indian food but this was damn good
pretty good lunch buffet
theres alot of vegetarian choices if you stick to a certain kind of diet like myself
i eat only halal meat
i haven't asked if any of the meat on buffet was halal only because i don't want to make a fuss
i will however call ahead and see if they are serving any halal meat before i decide to dine for dinner
sometimes they have chicken and goat but sometimes only goat
as far as authenticity goes
i can't personally say because i am not south_asian
that being said
a friend_of_mine who is complains alot that there is no authentic south_asian restaurants_in_madison
this how ever does not take away from the tastiness that i have experienced at maharaja
they have satisfying dishes that come in satisfying portions
if you dare to go to the spicy side of the spectrum they are constantly filling your water
which is awesome
you don't want to be left without water when the burn becomes too much
you can ask for not so spicy though
the only not so great thing i've ever had here was the cheese pakora
they kind of seemed like they were pre made
as in frozen
and not fresh
that was the only thing
ever
in all the times i've been to maharaja
both east and west locations have awesome service and tasty main_dishes
you'll be treated like royalty at the maharaja
i first came upon this place by chance
i was in town for work and noticed that there was an indian restaurant nearby
after reading the great reviews_on_yelp
i knew i had to try it for myself
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala along with naan_bread and a cup of chai
i ordered the food to be indian hot
the waiter replied
i like your confidence
it was very tasty and hot just as i like it
the restaurant was well kept
the staff treat the guests as royalty so the service is wonderful
and the prices are decent for what you're getting
don't forget to stop by the indian grocery that is located next_door to this location
it has a large selection of items so that you can make your own indian dinner at home
will i be back the next time i'm in town
absolutely
we did takeout and we ended_up with large portions of excellent chicken_tikka_masala
garlic_naan and veggie pakora and they gave_us free_chai for the road
i have a new found love for indian food and when i found myself in madison i had to check_this_place_out
it was most excellently delicious
the staff was very nice and the price for people including drinks and an appetizer was about
if you ever find yourself on the east_side of madison
you should really check_this_place_out
the food here is good
my husband and i are new to indian food
so i can't_speak to its authenticity or how good it is in comparison to other indian food
but overall we really liked the food here
the chicken_tikka_masala was particularly delicious
though there were lots of very good options at the buffet
the naan was also good
and needed to cool the mouth every so often
the service was okay
nothing good or bad to say there
the inside was really not all that awesome
that was the major part that brought down the experience for us
it looked like it could do with a face lift
the decor was ok
nothing special but there were some odd mylar stars and hot air balloons hanging from the ceiling
came in for dinner and there are two other tables at
on a thursday night
i wonder if people go to bed early around this neighborhood or if this place just isn't that popular
coconut soup was weird
a mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered_down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag
this was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and i found this soup to be disapointing
lamb saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing
it's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and i lost a little of my appetite
though the lamb was tender and cooked well
the overall dish was very very salty with no special taste
just a little spicy
a little indian
and a little lamb
they are probably using curry paste from a jar
or there is just not a very imaginative cook in the kitchen because the whole dish was lacking in flavor
besides salt
a whole cardamom pod was left hidden in the diarrhea sludge
which led to an unpleasant burst of cardamom in one bite
rice had clearly been sitting around for awhile and was very dry throughout with crunchy bits and very chewy bits
i just don't see how this is acceptable to serve someone in a restaurant
rice is one of the cheapest ingredients out there
if the rice has been sitting for too long
throw it out and make more
i tried the saag with the rice and the oily mess of lamb saag rehydrated the rice somewhat
and the rice's absorption of the saag took away some of its saltiness
three sauces or chutneys that came with the papadom were not very good at all
had to ask to have my_water_glass filled every_single time i finished it
this is a major pet peeve
excellent
excellent
very impressed with their assorted curry dishes
highly_recommend
don't expect fancy atmosphere
the staff moves at their own pace but that doesn't matter when the food is soooo good
we went for the buffet on a sunday morning
and are so glad we decided_to_give it a try
my husband's favorite is chicken_tikka massala which they had on the buffet
i'm pretty new to indian food
but there were so many options and so many things i liked
the service was amazing
our_water_glasses were constantly full
which is good considering some of the food is really spicy
we're not from that area
but if we were in the neighborhood
i would consider going there again
what a great find
as several others have pointed_out
the decor is nothing_to_write_home_about nor even to dwell on it in a yelp review
but it has always been my contention that if you offer great food at a fair price and are not offering a dining_experience
then restaurant cleanliness and an attentive wait_staff is a better investment than wood carvings and mood lighting
we came for lunch and it turned out they had a fantastic buffet
everything from tandoori_chicken to palak aloo
every dish was so flavorful and authentic
having spent two years overseas where i associated with several indians
i know they would have been suitably impressed
the waiter brought naan to the table and was there when our_water_glasses emptied
he didn't hover but he was attentive
my lunch partner and i got a kick out of the sign that politely let buffet eaters know we were welcome to the food but would be charged for waste
it should go without saying
but i have been to several all_you_can_eat buffets and have witnessed first hand the amount of leftover food that has to be thrown away because people take too much
personally i think part of the blame should be placed on the cooks managers for not putting out a better product
but certainly the customer is largely to blame
hence
a sign that clearly articulates the maharaja's expectation of its customers is a good thing
let's face it
if the food was bad
the customer would be screaming
bottom_line
eat here if you love indian food
at tha advice of the reviews_on_yelp
my family decided to try out this restaurant
excellent food at decent prices
if you like indian food
i would highly_recommend that you eat here
i was in town on business and had a free night so i decided_to_give maharaja a try
i had the mulligatawny soup
garlic_naan
and the tandoori_chicken
the food was really good
awesome naan
and the portions were quite large
the chicken was out_of_this_world and i could not finish it all
the only negative was the service
i dined on a tuesday evening at
ish
it took a long time for my waiter to take my order
though the place seemed relatively full
there were only two waitstaff
when i arrived
there seemed to be several employees outside smoking
also
my waiter was not of indian descent
which is perfectly fine
but he did not speak english
thus my questions about the menu and what he recommended went unanswered
it also took a long time for my food to arrive
from the time i sat_down to the time my food arrived was almost an_hour
all in all
i would go back again because the food was very good
i would have given stars
save for the awful customer_service
i went here at the suggestion of several people who told me how great the food was
i admit my experience with indian_cuisine is limited
but for the most part pleasant
so i thought it was worth a try
the food was outstanding
i ordered aloo ghobi
really flavorful and spicy
i don't know if this is commonplace everywhere
but since i moved up from texas it's been really difficult to order a dish and be satisfied with the level of heat
here they asked if i preferred mild or hot
when i said hot
they asked how hot
i said very and they definitely delivered
my husband ordered the tandoori_chicken which is a very generaously sized portion
it comes out on what looks like a small griddle
steaming
with peppers and lemon slices
they also brought out a big bowl of white rice along with some naan_bread that we asked for
all in all
it was a very satisfying experience and we will definitely_be_going_back
service can be a little slow
but the staff are very attentive and helpful
they're also really good at refilling drinks
i know it seemed like our server kept refilling my glass every time i took a sip
i can't say enough good things about this place
my husband
son and i go there at least once a month and it is always delicious and they take such good care of you
some restaurants look at you when you walk in with a little one and grimace they are always joking with our son and making him
and us
feel very comfortable
the food is sooo good not a bad thing on the menu
if_you're_looking for a great indian meal in a great atmosphere with fantastic staff this is the place
our family went to celebrate a birthday with an indian dinner there were of us in our happy group
we have been going to the maharaja for years
to enjoy the lunch_buffets
valentines day
birthdays etc
tonight the food was good
but the service was an issue
to start
we could see that the staff had changed
the service took a long time
even though there were only tables with customers and six wait_staff
the server did not understand english well enough to properly place the order
so there was extra wine for one person
also
the glassware and flatware were spotted
with some that needed to be sent back
the service had really changed for the worse
the server would clear one dirty plate
then wander off
return five minutes_later to get another and so on
the manager or owner really needs to train the staff
they were all working
but seemed unclear as to who was responsible for what duties
we also ordered ice_cream and a special birthday dessert
while very tasty the service was vey slow
at least minutes from the time the ice_cream was ordered to served
what really put us over the top was when they refused to accept their own gift_certificate that they sold to me in june towards the bill
not including tip
it had only been approximately weeks
apparently
this location has been sold
the old owners still own the location on odana rd
same name
but not this one
therefore
they would not accept their own gift_certificate and told us
we could use it at odana rd
interestingly
they still kept the best of madison sign on the door for the old ownership
they will need to take this down
again
we were surprised at the business decision about their own gift_certificate
authentic indian in madison
wisconsin
score
the neighborhood felt a little sketchy
and as a solo diner
my service wasn't very good
food was ok though
my husband and i came today with a group_of_people for their sunday lunch buffet and i have to say
for the price
excellent service and quality of food
i really recommend_this_place
i called ahead and they allowed our group to have a semi private room away from the restaurant but close to the buffet
the buffet had all the dishes you would hope for and some unexpected ones as well
i really enjoyed the chicken_tikka
chana_masala
samosa and more common dishes
but they also had a goat dish
fish
several biryanis
really nice chutneys
etc
my_only_complaint about this place was that the naan wasn't in a basket with a napkin to keep it warm
it was just plopped on a plate and got cold quickly
the naan was great and deserves to be kept warm
the dessert section of the buffet had a ton of variety but the mango_ice_cream was superb
apparently
when you order a meal during the week
even take away
everyone gets a mango_ice_cream as well
the food was excellent but the mango_ice_cream will bring me back
best samosas i've had in las_vegas
samosa were not greasy
had good flavor and did not skimp on the meat filling
good dipping chutneys too
retired couple run the place
the wife is friendly
the husband
well you got to warm up to him first
i always go for the lamb samosas which my non indian pakistani friends co_workers also enjoy
atif is right it is definitely the best samosa i've ever had i've had the beef
chicken and veggie
very tasty
fresh and hot
it doesn't_look_like much from the outside
but it very well is a full indian restaurant
i really like the na an bread with garlic or onions here
very tasty
plus this is one of my favorite places for tandoori_chicken
i've yet to try the curry because i'm a creature of habit with indian food
i mean don't_get_me_wrong i really like the spices and spicey
you know the prices have gone up
regardless it's still good
definitely worth it
the staff is friendly and patient i mean i had a white dude with me and she didn't even get mad because after visits he got what i got
i wanted to go to panda express
one entrance east
i just wanted to get something quick while running an errand and scooting back to the conference i was attending
minutes_later
my belly was full of veggie_samosas and full veggie thali and i was a happy boy
i don't dig raitha
so they sub'd aloo_gobi without asking me
how did they know
could they read my mind
amazing
possibly
sad news
i chatted with the owners and they admitted that they were selling the place
when that happens
i sure hope the lucky inheritor of this establishment continues their fine tradition
don't go by the name
this place has nothing to do with samosa
you can find better samosa in any indian restaurant
this place is run by an old couple
old guy is very rude
and greedy
food is not that great either
saag_paneer was just boiled spinach with hard paneer on top of it
malai_kofta was good
but seemed stale
paneer butter masala was a shame
naan is good though
everything is over priced
and low in quantity
no lunch buffet
and they are closed on sundays
we had to go to taco bell after spending on lunch for people here
i wouldn't mind paying more than person on lunch if the enviironment is good enough
i don't know how come they are surviving
probably tourists come here for the
samosa_factory
name and also its close to the strip
locals would never go to this place again
and the owner place is not kid friendly at all
he was complaining all the time about the little food my kid dropped
we literally had to clean the floor and table when we left
all the other star reviews seem made up

worst indian_restaurant_in_vegas
posted by sk
i agree with the previous reviewer
easily the worst indian restaurant in las_vegas
it is not even authentic_indian_food
they try to be cute and make it taste like fusion food
but fail with astonishing zeal
quoting a woody allen one liner
food is terrible
and portions are so small
they add gratuity whether you liked the service or not
way overpriced
even in more expensive metros like sfo or nyc
you do not have pay this much for a meal at an ordinary shopping strip indian restaurant
it's no gaylord india or bombay palace
wilshire bvld beverly hills
yet costs so much
what gives
the owners
husband and wife team
serve customers sometimes
they are curt and glum
a less forgiving person might think these folks are just plain rude
hope this review is helpful
cheers
would not go again posted by pzippy
i was really excited to find that samosa_factory was so close by
i called and ordered and drove down to pick_it_up
i ordered enough for dinner and leftovers for the next day
the manager was very nice when i picked_up the food
when i got home
i was more than disappointed
the samosas were edible but barely
though i must say the chutney was rather good
the lamb_korma was not good
the naan was pretty good
but the worst was the spinach
saag
paneer
to say it was an atrocity would be a compliment
i had one bite and couldn't stomach anymore
it was awful
i finished the samosas and the naan and little rice and threw the rest away
if_you_are_looking for good indian in las_vegas
keep looking
because this isn't it
avoid it
horrible food and owner posted by susan ty
its the worst restaurant that i have tried
went there after looking at the reviews at citysearch
but was utterly disappointed
the owner refused to give an extra plate to my husband to share the rice pilaf
he wanted us to dig in the servers plate
apart from that the food was horrible
it looked like the food was days old
we got a stomachache after eating that
the gratuity is added on check
even if you do not want to leave a a tip after a horrible service
the owner even fought with us over this issue
please stay_away_from this place
the food is horrible
and place stinks
samosa_factory
worst indian food
posted by barbara
samosa_factory
this is one of the worst indian restaurant in l
v
if one is looking for a good indian food
this is not the right place
owner behave very rudely especially who are new to the place
we noticed that he behave politely who are his frequent diner
named samosa_factory but serves worst samosas
they might be making fresh food everyday but leftovers are also served and we had this experience
we eat indian food quite often but never ate such food
it seems they serve days old food
never ever visit this place
cons
worst food and service
the name says it all
you must order a samosa
and you will enjoy it
the main entrees are pretty good too
my wife is a saag fan
its all she gets and it was quite good here
i like that they have lots of vegetarian_options
we always eat too much when we go there
we average a tab
for two peeps
items may be a little pricey
but we're more than willing to support small mom_and_pop digs like this
the husband
i'm assuming
is a little dry
but c'mon
does that really affect the food
the few times we've been there
we had the veggie_samosas served up hot with chutney
papadum
paneer palak
shrimp korma
shrimp_curry
paneer korma
and sweet_rice for dessert
the sweet_rice was great
not too sweet
but i did have to pick our potent chunks of cinnamon and clove
all of the entrees were great
savory and loaded with flavor in the classic indian fashion
i also tried the mango_lassi
which is really sweet and quite large and my bf had the plain lassi
which he said was perfectly tangy
but he doesn't like things too sweet
maybe the shrimp_curry was lacking a little
but the korma is always great
if you like creamy coconutty sauces
when we go in around noon
there's no one there
but by the time we leave
there's like four other parties
i love taking my time here
i never feel rushed
every one that comes to drop our food or refill our water is always smiling and friendly
off the strip
non casino
this is a pretty bad
okay a really bad indian restaurant
it was a horrible experience
i don't even know where to start
the food was bad
the server had no knowledge of what was on the menu and the interior was like a fast_food restaurant
plus
being from the south i'm not knocking a southern accent
but i don't want my server to say
hey y'all what's in this dish
you know what's cool about this spot
they don't play the typical world beat tabla bullshit that's played in most indian_restaurants
they play jazz
and i don't mean smooth jazz
i mean coltrane and miles davis jazz
the food is not traditional_indian
but fresh and tasty nonetheless
good parathas
samosas
obviously
garlic_naan
vege biryani
salted lassis
fantastic okra
and really fresh tasting saag_paneer
they also sell mason jars of homemade chutney
which are pricey but the chili chutney is surprisingly hot and flavorful
by far the best place for vegetarian indian food in vegas
now
for the less desirable aspects of this spot
i am almost positive that they use msg as a flavor enhancer in their food
a farley typical practice in indian_cuisine
because i invariably end up with a headache nausea after eating here
the owners
a married couple
aren't terribly friendly
and the
dead pan
husband can be downright alienating at times
i would recommend_this_place as a nice take out spot with the caveat that if you are sensitive to msg you may want to avoid altogether
excellent the absolute best garlic_naan
raita
samosas we've had light
great seasoning and right on 'target' we had the vegetable_korma and the mattar_paneer perfect and just the right level of spices
our favorite indian is ajanta in berkeley and the red fort in london but the samosa_factory can give either a run for their money
we're looking_forward to our next trip to las_vegas so we can go back twice or three times during our stay our only regret is that we found it on our last_night in town
yummy veggie friendly food
the owner is very nice
and very friendly
best chutney in vegas
see for yourself
this place is bomb diggity
op
i'm from central new jersey
otherwise known as mumbai west
where authentic indian_restaurants are three deep in every_single strip_mall
indian food is my favorite ethnic cuisine
so i know good indian when i eat it
and samosa_factory is that good
this was our first visit
and it's now our new favorite vegas indian restaurant
the food was terrific
the service outstanding
and the waitress
katie
was friendly
helpful
and attentive
just as important
we were made to feel welcome
by her
as well as by the owner
we started with veggie_samosas
i love them
but don't often order them
because they're usually heavy and greasy
not here
the pastry covering was light and flaky
the filling was fresh and delicious
and it was one helluva stuffed samosa
the accompanying coriander sauce was the best i've ever had
and the chutney had a deliciously different taste
we had chicken_tikka
which was cut in bite sized pieces and mixed with green and yellow peppers
onions
and an assortment of flavorful spices
the dish was brimming with flavor
and happily
it didn't have the overwhelming heaviness that i always dread at indian_restaurants
my nit with this dish is that we were sharing it
so presenting it on a small
flat plate made it a bit difficult to transfer to our own plates
we also shared a chicken spinach curry
i hesitated before ordering it
expecting the spinach to be drowning in cream and ghee
it wasn't
and the cubes of chicken were the most tender i've ever had
the onion nan had an abundance of onion and again
was lighter and less greasy than i expected
we also ordered a side of raita
i was intrigued by the description
which said that the yogurt was mixed with granny smith apple
hmm
different
and it was
the apple added a slight sweetness
and was the perfect complement to the tanginess of the yogurt
it was the outstanding accompaniment for the chicken_tikka
the mango_lassi was great
too
be aware that the restaurant has no liquor license
but if you must drink
you can get sloshed before or after at pt's pub a few doors down
i suspect kristin b
did just that before writing her ridiculous non review
the entrees were served with rice
the menu had the word
pilaf
blacked out
and the rice was plain
white rice
this was a first for me
and it didn't make me ecstatic
i missed the grilled onion and great flavor that a good rice pilaf with basmati_rice should have
but this is a small price to pay for a wonderful dinner that will otherwise please your palate
and not make you feel as if your fat and calorie quota has exceeded the national debt
all in all
this was a memorable meal
and one that we look_forward to repeating very soon
i'm_a_huge_fan
the owner
s
have been there every time i've gone
which i think is important
the food is authentic and well priced
while waiting for my indian take out order that has always been the exact same
they offered me to try something they thought i'd enjoy
how many places do that
it is now the only thing i order and it's not even on the menu
wonderful people and service
a must try restaurant
fantastic food
very friendly_staff
rivals the best indian food in other places in vegas
but very inexpensive
sad
lonely plain looking location so don't go to impress a date unless she is cool enough to appreciate good food
they serve northern indian style cuisine
no buffet
just fresh home_cooked indian food
i drove crosstown in hopes of discovering something extraordinary
what i found in this small restaurant was decent
the decor was nicer than i expected
as a
hole_in_the_wall
kind of place
the restaurant was cozy and had a nice warm color scheme
chairs and tables were basic and the wait_staff was nice
however
nice isn't enough
there were other tables besides mine and service felt incredibly slow
we ordered a lamb samosa appetizer which was probably the best dish of the evening
the meat was a little too lumpy
but the seasoning was delicious
then we waited for what felt_like twice as long as it should have been for our entrees to arrive
and my pappadums didn't come as an appetizer but as a side dish with the entrees when i reminded our server
communication between the two people working front of the house seemed to be lacking
with just other tables besides ours
we were asked twice at the beginning if we wanted any beverages
it just makes me wonder what they would do when they have a full house
they might be weeded with tables
i had the spinich paneer and it was a little bland but the portion was good and the dish was generous on the paneer
the chicken_korma was quite flavorful though the one scoop of rice i got on a plate felt a bit chintzy
presentation of a single scoop of white rice on a white round plate placed in front of a diner could use a little color
even if it were a sprig of something green for decoration
all in all
the experience was fine
if service were better
i might have given this place stars
but it just goes to show
service is very important to dining out
though i won't rush back to this restaurant
i hope they do well in the future
last april this business changed hands
before it was authentic
tastefully done
and was in the upper echelons of indian_restaurants in vegas
ah
the good ole days
the current establishment is a far cry from the previous one
first off
the decor is
well
tacky
and not even in a cheeky vegas way either
it is a bit gaudy and done in a kitsch fashion resplendent with do not touch signs on on touristy sitars
and i don't think having a sink full of rocks in the bathroom sink is very hygienic
hello health code violations
i understand menus cost money
but to have half torn covers with handwritten higher prices scribbled in is not a good first impression
my second impression was to have a skinny guy leaning over me like a vulture trying to get me to order
i found out he was the new owner
and the other server looked like she stepped out of biker bar blue jean emporium
replete with unkempt dangly hair
and seeing her reaching over people's food made me cringe
hair tie
anyone
against first judgements i make the plunge and decide to stay
since when does an authentic indian restaurant serve mango_lassi with ice
and the garlic_naan was thin
almost tortilla thin
mostly burnt
and tasted like it was sitting in the back for a bit under a heat lamp
it got worse for the entrees
they were slopped in their bowls with dirty sides
flatly spiced
and overcooked
and the rice was sitting there like a mound of white blandless solidity
lamb_curry isn't supposed to need a chainsaw to slice through
and the chicken_vindaloo was cut in strips a la fajitas
pounded and dense
and i thought the lamb was tough
the waiter owner asked how it was and i told i would tell him when we were done
he never asked again
how i long for the old place
it was cozy and authentic
the exact opposite of what it has become
and anyone from somewhere other than vegas would be sorely disappointed with this restaurant as it is now
instead of the samosa_factory
they should rename it
the samosa tragedy
my taste_buds agree
i've been robbed
pretty good food
not authentic indian definitely a little westernized but still great flavors
the food was a little pricy wasn't convinced it was worth the price but it was worth trying
i love_this_place
rick the new owner is very accomodating
my friend from england always has to visit samosa when she is here
her fav dish is chicken_korma
mine is veggie kofta with mahkni sauce
they have great lunch_specials too
i really like this place
the restaurant recently changed ownership
and i think that the change has brought it up from a three star restaurant to four
the samosas went from being somewhat bland to nicely spiced
the service is a lot better
very attentive
too
the food is a bit westernized
and all the indian dishes that americans know are definitely on the menu
tikka masala
anyone
then again
food is all about fusion and mixing cultures
so who am i to complain
plus
it's all pretty yummy
the portions and prices are excellent
the best part is that they have a rather impressive vegetarian menu as well as a separate vegan menu
i'm neither a vegetarian nor a vegan
but i have many friends who are not meat_eaters
so this is a place where we can go and actually eat together without making strange requests
the new owners like to experiment with their recipes and try_new_things they are very open with their process
and i like that
the bad news
i was in las_vegas
the good news
i wasn't on the strip
the bad news
the temperature at our hotel near the strip was averaging degrees
the good news
it was somewhat cooler at red rock canyon
the bad news
we were hungry and had about a thousand miles of suburbs between us and that indian restaurant i was meaning to try i'd seen advertised at every bus stop in town
the good news
we never made it to that place
okay
enough news
about halfway
or more
back to the strip from red rock canyon my stomach stopped grumbling and started screaming at me to eat
now
whenever my stomach gets louder than the voices in my head i start to get worried
i was scanning the restaurantscape through las vegas' suburbs for anything that wouldn't have gluten in it
hi there
in case we haven't been introduced
i'm silly ack
i don't eat gluten
continuing down charleston i considered my options
kfc
nope
ihop
nope
vi
nope
dd
nope
dq
um
maybe after dinner
nobody in the suburbs has time for restaurants with actual names anymore
we only get initials now
i dodged
or in my case
toyotaed
south to sahara and continued east figuring mr
stomach would just have to wait till we got to that indian place across town
note to celiacs
indian places are notorious for not having gluten in most of their entrees
not to mention indian food in general's pretty damn yummy anyway
just ask your waiter for gluten_free options
if the restaurant 'gets it'
they'll be very helpful
if you get a dumb look instead of helpfulness
back away slowly
the restaurants actually cooking their food fresh and not getting spice mixes and prepackaged ingredients will point out all the entrees without gluten and point you away from things like breads and samosas
did i just see the word samosa
that sounds indian
i skidded my rental car around a full one eighty and hammered it back to samosa_factory
thanks
hertz
like it's on rails
forget about that other indian place
this looks like an indian restaurant and it's right here in front of us which makes it the best indian place in town
there was no buffet
an immediate brownie point for the factory
i respect a place that makes me order from a menu so they can cook it up fresh
i was already ignoring the menu's samosas even before our helpful waiter told me to avoid the samosas along with the other gluten ruined food
it's a bummer not being able to try their namsake
kind of like being a vegeterian in a steak house
but i probably wouldn't have gotten samosas anyway
so there
instead we got chicken_tikka_masala
aloo_gobi
and okra
i think some places call the okra dish bhindi_masala which sounds like it's got a lot more to it than just okra
sf's
samosa_factory
not san_francisco
okra's got a lot more to it than just okra
so to avoid confusion i'll call it okra
bhindi_masala
or
since we're in the suburbs
sf's
sf n sf
o
bm
our entrees were mind blowingly tasty
spiced about as medium as we'd hedged on when ordering them
whether you want no spice or burn your face off hot
they'll oblige
just be specific when you order
the only problem was that there was not enough rice so the end of each entree ended_up flying solo on our plates
a rather soupy
saucy solo
as an encore we had kheer
which is rice_pudding
i guess we still had rice on our minds after not getting enough rice with dinner
it was good
but i have to admit after having kheer at punjab
a sf
not sf but sf
restaurant where they load their kheer up with huge amounts of cardamom
pistachio and almonds
i found it a little bland
like rice_pudding
admittedly samosa factory's kheer is probably how proper kheer should taste so i'll shut up
psst
hey chef at sf
not sf
try the kheer at punjab next time you're in sf
not sf
the good thing is after all that great indian food for dinner and dessert there was no more stomach screaming
and it was in no way necessary for us to turn back west toward dq
we did
however venture back out to samosa_factory the next afternoon just to make sure it was really as good as we thought it was
it was
i have been to vegeterian indian_restaurants
reader
meet my review of masalaa
my review of masalaa
this is my new friend
reader
and have been to many omnivore indian_restaurants
all of which had vegeterian sections on their menus
because there's a lot of vegetables in india
silly
but i've never been to an indian restaurant that seperated their vegeterian section into
vegeterian
and
vegan
sections
pretty smart and cutting edge
i think these_guys are on the technological forefront of u
s
style
not u
s
but
oh
never mind
indian dining
be on the lookout for them to launch a fast casual version of this restaurant in hundreds of cities by the end of q
that's the fourth quarter for those of you not familiar with betting on football at the office
if not
you didn't hear it here first
silly ack
i discovered the samosa_factory after doing a web search when i arrived in vegas for business
i grew_up eating indian food and eat it at_least_once_a_week at my local tandoori
i was surprised to find so many indian_restaurants in my search but was delighted to pick tsf
the food is all freshly cooked using great natural ingredients and the service is warm and friendly
the vegetarian_options are great
i'm a veggie
and the vegan and meat lists extensive also
i ate there twice on my last trip and again this evening when i was back in town with my son and his friends to celebrate his st
they all loved it and are eating the copious leftovers right now in their room
we'll_definitely_be_back thanks
a friend recommended the restaurant
don't let the name fool you
i found the interior upscale
the staff_was_very_friendly
even when i sent the iced_tea back
i hate chai_tea
i had the butter_chicken which was out_of_this_world
for dessert the rice_pudding
fantastic
it had cinnamon and fresh blueberries on it
my friend had the coconut chicken which i tried also
hard to choose between the two which i liked more
great food
but for whatever reason owner has really racist attitude with actual indians
not sure why
twice i went there and left tip but every_single time as soon as he will see us or for that matter any other indian family visiting_vegas you can see on his face
don't racially profile people
i must say that this is best chat samosa we ever had in us
samosa_factory ha being reborn with a savior fare in their dishes that have me dreaming of my next meal there
the food is flavor full yet light on the stomach unlike typical indian_cuisine that tends to be way to greasy and the spices seem to hit your stomach and make u want to fall asleep with nightmares
i will_be_coming_back more often now specially for lunch since their prices are as good as any joints around town
make sure to try their rice_pudding it is so simple and so delightful makes me have daydreams on how good it is
but try for yourself and enjoy the rebirth of this great local spot
njoy
had passed this place on our way to hedary's restaurant registered in our heads
later the same evening after doing hoover dam
needed a snack
samosa being a good snack thought about samosa_factory
with a name like that
samosa should be the signature dish
right
that's what we thought
ordered sides vegetarian samosas as a take out rushed to hotel to relax enjoy the samosas with some nice indian tea
what a let down
good amount of filling
no doubt
but absolutely bland
no taste at all
just boiled potatoes
half a samosa consumed rest relegated to trash
don't think we will be visiting this place again
nor recommend it to anyone
thorough let down
we are
indians as in bombay
from
georgia
here for
week vacation
i've been hearing good things about the samosa_factory for years
but had yet to make it over there until tonight
it doesn't_look_like much from the outside
but it's really cozy cute inside
the tables chairs leave a bit to be desired
but they really did a lot with the decor to improve the ambiance
we ordered chicken_vindaloo hot sour chicken
which were both good
the vindaloo was awesome
really spicy delicious
the hot sour chicken was good
but all the sesame seeds in the sauce were a bit much for me texture wise
i also had a hot chai
which was perfect
the owner came by and talked to us
asking us what we thought of the place and how we'd heard of it
he was really nice and made me feel very welcome and appreciated as a new customer
also
they were playing great music
right after finishing my meal
while sipping on my tea my favorite my morning jacket song came on it was a really nice moment
went here yesterday for lunch
it was ok
if you like samosas they were good here
other than that i've had better indian food
they have plenty of vegetarian and vegan entrees though
so if you're vegan or have a friend who is then i would reccomend this place
but tamba and ghandi are better
the place is pretty small too so dont go with a big group
also it was full of white people
im white too
but thats kind of a giveaway that its not as authentic as other places because i did not see one indian eating there
it seems that everyone is in agreement that the food at the samosa_factory is not bad
the degrees to which people like it seem to vary
my wife and i ate here for dinner one night and found the food to be
good
without being outstanding
portions were small
even by the usual standard of indian_restaurants and the total came to close for the both of us for a couple of appetizers a couple of main meals and some naan
overall there's a reasonably tasty meal to have here
but for a tiny and sparsely decorated restaurant located in an unremarkable strip_mall i expect a lot more bang for my buck
one of the few vegas indian establishments not to offer a lunch buffet
great tasting and healthy indian
well
supposedly healthy because they said they don't use ghee
ghee gross pure fat
but the food was definitely delicious
and reasonably_priced
too
will definitely_be_going_back when craving some hot n' spicy indian food
this is quite possibly one of my favorite little indulgences
it's quaint
family_owned
and their dedication to serving quality meals is very obvious
i absolutely love their veggie_samosas and tikka masala
not sure if they serve the watermelon shrimp dish anymore
but the flavors were completely unique and amazing
if they still serve it
order it
you_will_not_be_disappointed
the samosa_factory is very vegetarian friendly and uses fresh_ingredients
the staff is so polite and welcoming here
my_only_complaint is that i wish the dining_area was just a little bigger
best indian restaurant i have ever had
being indian i am very picky and know what good indian food is
this place has exceptional service and the menu has options for everyone
vegan
vegetarians
meatatarians
and even halal options
on the downside
i would not reccomend this place on a busy friday or saturday_night because they are usually understaffed
this restaurant is one of my favorite places for comfort_food
i have known rick for a long time and i love his cooking and how personable he is
his restaurant reflects his passion and kindness
it is a great place for lunches and group parties for dinner
many nights have i savored the delicious butter_chicken
on busy nights its good to be patient
as sometimes there are very little staff with rick doing most all the work
bless his heart
the service is great and it's a great atmosphere to dine
you gotta try the hot chai_tea to help digest all that great indian food
i love it here and take all my friends out when they come visit las_vegas
it is truly a gem
i don't know what happened between my visit
s
and the ones where people are hatin' on the samosas
because i had some of the best samosas i've ever tasted here
and that includes homemade ones by some very talented pakistani cooks
they were obviously made to order
as they came out piping_hot and crisp
and the chutney
my god the chutney
had i not been in public
i would have licked the bowl clean
they have much of the standard indian_fare
but one dish that is unusual is the fresh spinach curry
i've never had anything like it
barely wilted tender baby spinach leaves in a delicately spiced tomato sauce
not bland
but not your typical indian curry taste either
and definitely not spicy
ask for it hot if you crave the heat
love love love that they have a whole section of specifically vegan entrees and that anything on the menu that is vegan is clearly marked
no guesswork
reasonably_priced lunch_specials
great food
good service
my_only_complaint is that they're not closer to work or home
omg so good
i'm the pickiest eater in the world
and i discovered indian food at a different restaurant
i came to samosa_factory
because a friend_of_mine suggested it
and i was wowed
the food was awesome
the prices were also affordable
love it
was good
is ok
went last time and was not very happy with it
one of the best indian_restaurants_in_town
they do serve the best rice_pudding
reasonable_prices
i usually order the chicken_tikka_masala or the lamb_korma
great quality food
their sauces are rich and creamy
i think each entree is good for people
depending_on how hungry you are
but i've always been stuffed sharing an entree
small restaurant
but great service
food was ok
they prepare food based_on vegan style
food was not very authentic as i had hoped it to be
it's a good place if_you_are_looking for simple indian food and not for spicy
masala food
i've been to several of the more popular indian_restaurants in vegas
and this is by far my favourite
samosas are always fresh and flavourful
with a nice mix of subtle spices that is well complimented by a selection of chutneys
hot
crispy perfection
the lamb_korma is pure curry heaven
too
the boneless lamb is always tender and super tasty
with creamy sauce over fresh garlic_naan and aromatic basmati_rice
is your mouth_watering yet
then get off the internet and into your car
head down to samosa_factory for the best indian food vegas has to offer right now
i can't really compare their samosas to the rest of the world's
so i'm giving them the benefit of the doubt
i tried the vegetarian and the lamb
i ended_up preferring the vegetarian
though i love lamb
i found the fluffy potatoes and the bite of the peas inside the crunchy shell really enjoyable
the lamb samosa seemed a bit dry and flavorless
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
to use as a standard of measure
i've had several versions by now and enjoyed most of them a bit more than this
i felt that this one was pretty mediocre
with big tough chunks of chicken in a lot of runny sauce
the amount of rice they give is a single bowlful per entree
which is ok if it's one person but wouldn't be enough to feed both my boyfriend and i
i'm not sure if they charge for the additional portions of rice
but it would be worth asking if you order more
also
i like spicy food
a lot
i initially ordered the extra hot version of the dish
which the server assured me would be extremely hot
face melting
ly so
i eventually backed down to just the
hot
i ended_up being very disappointed by the overall heat_level
the other diner in the party who ordered a hot dish agreed in that her dish wasn't particularly spicy
either
the overall flavor wasn't too impactful initially it had a nice creeper heat
but it hit a mid note and then mellowed out
there were a few pieces of fresh herbs floating about in the orange sauce
which is a nice_touch
their rice had a good texture
i like that they have clearly marked and distinguished menus for vegetarians and vegans
i'd be willing to give them another chance if someone wanted us to go
but they're out of my way and didn't particularly impress me the first time around
i liked that their iced chai_tea was served without milk or creamer
making it a lot lighter and more refreshing
i'd never had it straight like that and it was nice
another diner tried the mango_lassi and didn't like it
it was then offered on to any willing participants and eventually found it's way into a garbage can several miles away and melted
i ate at samosa_factory twice last week
both times trying different lamb dishes
they were both outstanding
i also couldn't help ordering multiple portions of the garlic_naan both visits
rick and his staff do a phenomenal job
the kitchen and dining_room are small and inviting
unlike so many other places in las_vegas
rick is also very knowledgeable
quality driven and friendly
this place is somewhere you should check out and frequent often
it is hard_to_find a small owner driven place like this in vegas and we need to support the good ones out there
great authentic little sleepy indian place
outstanding service and great food
stars
the complaints about the food being bland are valid but only because they cook all the food mild be default
it says in the menu to ask for spicy if you like some kick
i can understand this but didn't see the section in the menu mentioning it so we got our food mild and it was certainly mild
great food though
very light
not heavy like most indian_restaurants and coming from an indian family i know my indian food well
looking_forward to going again and asking for some
kick
had
veggie_samosas
good chutneys
papadum
also good
chai
excellent
saag_paneer
very good
pretty sure the paneer was fresh also and not the indian grocery_store verka dhawat nanak prepakaged
chicken_tikka_masala
good
needs kick though there was no
tikka
skipped desert was too full
total cost was under bucks with tip tax will definately go again
amazing place
i love that feeling of a
family_owned
business off the strip and not a franchise
the owner
richard
is amazing
he is very interactive with the customer and remembered my friend's order from last time he was there
that just shows you how amazingly attentive he is
we ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
lamb spinach
shrimp_curry
and tons of their garlic_naan
i also ordered their mango_lassi for my drink and it was just amazing
i could not stop drinking it
if you like indian food
this is a great great great place to try out
they also have a vegan menu too
i love me some vegan friendly indian food and the chutneys were awesome
stars for the service and the samosas and chutneys
the samosas were delicious and had a great flakey outside with a little bit of salt that made them really pop
the service was great and super friendly
stars for the rest of the food
the entrees were a little under spiced and over salted
this may be because we were not asked about spice_levels when we ordered so we got generic bland style
the eggplant
which is a favorite at most places
was our least favorite
it was a bit over pureed and had little spices
out of the entrees
the fresh spinach curry was a standout
it had a great flavor
with your dinner you are only served a small scoop of rice on the plate
which was not enough for a second helping of food
since i wanted spicier food
i asked for something hot to put in and was brought a chili paste that added a good kick to the food
i will still highly_recommend this place and will be back in order to get some spicy food which i think will be much better
i am looking_forward to giving this place a star_review next time
this place had great atmosphere a perfect gem in the wall
it's not a huge restaurant but that's what makes the service better
the staff was very hospitable and attentive
we met the manager rick
who is the most sweetest
humble guy
it's great for groups of
but i went with a party of
which slowed the timing of the food
totally understandable since they aren't use to such a large_party
the food portions are family_style
and are reasonably_priced
we ordered their signature samosas
kinds
beef veggie
that's served with different kinds of dipping_sauces
my favorite is the green cilantro one
the butter_chicken
yummy creamy tomato curry
the lamb koran
coconut curry
chicken koran
garlic_naan
sweet spicy chicken
tandoori_chicken
sooo good
and a couple more curry dishes which i can't remember_the_name
everything was really good
and this was my first time eating indian food
all the dishes were very flavorful
also
try their mango ladee drink
it's a creamy yogurt smoothie
and also their signature rice_pudding for dessert
indian food is my new addiction
thanks to samosa_factory
d
this is the restaurant i go to whenever i travel to las_vegas on business
i'm clearly not the only person who feels this way
because i overheard someone at the next table say the same thing
it has great food and it's a very friendly place
there aren't many vegetarian_options in las_vegas
and this is the best i found
it even has an extensive vegan menu
which is extremely rare
i tried a few of these and they were all excellent
i particularly liked the turnip dish
a real treat
i haven't seen it anywhere_else
the decor is simple and not luxurious
but it's comfortable and it's a pleasant place to visit
the owner is not indian
but is passionate about indian food and obviously has a strong affinity for indian culture
which to my mind gives the restaurant an intriguing blend of indian and american culture
the best naan_bread in town
this is by far my most favorite indian food place in vegas
i've been to many and in my opinion you need to go the restaurant that makes the dish you like the best
my favorite dishes are chicken_korma and the shrimp_vindaloo
this place makes these dishes off the hook
i've had these at other indian_restaurants here in vegas and they just don't match up
even though i don't like the lamb here i'm still giving them a because they make my favorite dishes the best
the garlic_naan is by far the best i've had too
incredible
my husband and i aren't too familiar_with_indian_food so we didn't really know what to expect
pleasantly_surprised would be a complete understatement
it is a small
cozy
and warm environment
we were immediately greeted_by who we think was the owner
he was extremely friendly and informative for newbies like us
he suggested the kameer rather than the hot and sour chicken
boy oh boy were we glad that he did
it was one of the best dishes i've tasted
we were super excited_to_try the naan after reading all of the reviews
everyone was spot on
so delicious
at the end of the meal he surprised us with a generous sampling of the rice_pudding
wow
it was sooooo good
d
needless_to_say
we will be back very soon to enjoy more delicious samosas
pakora
kameer
naan
and excellent rice_pudding
i would have rated stars if i had the option
mmmm mmmm mmmm
a hit and a miss
we went here looking at the reviews and were disappointed
don't_get_me_wrong
if you're new to indian food
like many reviewers here seem to be
you'll probably like it
unfortunately for samosa fake tory
we've had our share of good indian food and samosa_factory isn't it
first off
to the uninitiated
samosas look and taste nothing like the one's you find here
i mean
not even close
google samosas and you will see what they look like
after our samosas
we ordered the thalis
sort of an indian mixed plate
and the naan
fluffy
delicious indian bread
was great
i didn't like the saag
mustard leaf
but my so did
neither of us liked the chicken curry or the potatoes and cauliflower
contrary to popular claim
the rice wasn't basmati
you can't ever go wrong with mango_lassi
mango flavored yogurt drink
and that probably was the best part of our meal
in summary
our food was okay but the alien samosa was a massive fail
if you've never had a samosa please do yourself a favor and grab one from an authentic indian restaurant
you will not regret it
may i recommend gandhi's on paradise road or tamba on the strip for the most authentic and best_indian_food_in_town
positives the service was good
our server
who i think is also the owner
seemed like a genuinely nice guy
not your typical indian restaurant
small seating_area
the food was surprising
again not typical indian
food was tasteful but not burdened with spices
i love_this_place
i eat there every other weekend
garlic_naan is to die for
the food is excellent and so is the service
sooooo yummy
they have a great vegan menu and the people who own it are so nice
we ate dinner there and asked the guy if we could order some to go since we were moving and had no food in the house
he made us a bag full of stuff with about triple the amount of rice and lots of extra sauces
at no extra charge
along with paper_plates and plastic forks which was a godsend since all our dishes were packed up
it's a small thing but i thought it was very thoughtful of them and it was a big_deal to us
paneer that melts in_your_mouth
yum
spicing that is mild and yet has wonderful complex flavor to it
restful atmosphere
attentive service and fresh food with little oil
so good that i went back a few days later for another meal
was thrilled to see so many vegan as well as vegetarian_options here
have eaten at lots of indian_restaurants in the bay_area and vegas
and this is my favorite of all
looking_forward to my next visit to vegas and coming here
samosa_factory is where i go to read a book
eat something delicious and feel taken_care_of after i've had a crap day
if you're a spice fiend
be clear and firm about your desired spice_level
otherwise
it's pretty tame
i wouldn't say bland
but if you enjoy crying while you eat
you will be disappointed
i especially love
their veggie samosa_chaat
their samosas
duh
the hot sour chicken
their naan and oh my god
i love their khir
no matter how full
i always cram in an order of khir
i don't have much to add to the comments of previous reviewers
but
this place is delicious
and the fact it has a good sized vegan menu but also serves meat things is a boon for carnivores like me that want to be able to dine with their vegan friends
oh_yeah
and the chocolate cherry samosa that we had for dessert was to die for
i was debating on giving this place four stars instead of five
but i couldn't help to give it five because of the hospitality
uniqueness
and deliciousness of the cuisine
this is definitely a gem worth seeking in las_vegas if you want something different
i'm a newbie at indian_cuisine
the menu was at first overwhelming because a lot of the items i was largely unfamiliar with
names and all
but the eggplant
onion
and tomato happened to stand out to me
and it was really the neighboring table that made me make my decision
i received more than a plentiful bowl
a scoop of rice
and tried the garlic_naan
my god
i didn't think vegan could taste as good as it did
while it did taste better than it looked
i couldn't be so harsh because it was definitely flavorful and really hit_the_spot
the place is surprisingly small and modern with indian decor
the hospitality and service was excellent
the waiter very friendly
but i wished there could have been a second one because the day i went there was a large_party
so service was a little more delayed than usual
i felt_like the server had no problem with any requests or questions that i had
and was more than willing to get anything i wanted
i would recommend not to come here if you're in a hurry
you sit_down when you arrive
but it takes time to make the food with the quality that it has
and the whole place seems to have a patient
relaxed atmosphere
the garlic_naan is awesome
they have great lunch_specials
try the lamb
best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
their lamb is always perfect
every visit
i have to have the following
a hot chai
lamb samosas
masala fries
and an order of naan
every main_dish i've had was great
perfectly_cooked
and any time i had a question
the servers or even the owner was extremely cordial
if you have food allergies
trust_me
they'll help you out
and if you have a vegan girlfriend
cough cough wink wink
then my girlfriend
i mean
your girlfriend will have plenty to eat
as they have almost half the menu full of vegan and vegetarian_dishes
cannot recommend_this_place enough
make sure you check it out
we had never tried indian food before
since we were new to vegan eating
we found this place through yelp
the service was excellent
we had roti w olive oil and garlic which was awesome
for the entrees we had the eggplant w potatoes
tomatoes and onions as well as the veggie kafta which were good as well
we went mild but probably could have done medium_spice
highly_recommend
this is just a little restuarant in a shopping mall that if you weren't looking for it
you would never find it
on the outside the place looks rather deceiving as it could be confused for any number of strip_mall type businesses
however
once you step inside your senses are completely delighted with not just the aroma of delicious cuisine but the appeal of the dining_area is striking as well
had the butter_chicken with garic naan and my partner had the cchicken curry
both dishes were served at a great temperature and i gotta tell you the butter_chicken was succulent and the tomato based broth was to die for
i would_definitely_go_back again
when it comes to ethnic cuisine this place is a real winner
this is a regular spot for my coworkers and i to meet for lunch and go over territory info
the samosas are great and the entrees are authentic
check_this_place_out
i glanced a recent lv weekly about their great write up of this establishment
praising the food
particularly the delicious and well done vegetarian_options as well and was reminded that i ate here about a year_ago and wanted to update with my review
for food
yes
this place was very good
however
jez
why on earth did you give this place such a low review
because the service was terrible and gave me no good reason to come back
especially with two great indian_restaurants by me
check it out
my party of three and myself went out
on their suggestion
to samosa_factory
they're fans of the restaurant and are frequent diners there
so i pretty much left all of the ordering up to them
the samosas were great
the side dishes were appropriately spicey to our requests so
as i said
the food was just fine
the server
however
a
when i informed that we were going to be paying with two credit cards as we were going to split the bill
i was told this was no bueno and that i had to go outside in the rain in the middle of the meal to go next_door to the grocery story to get money
so i went off and oh hey after hours the grocery story blocked access to the atm with rows of carts and closed the entrance that permits access to the atm
so i had to purchase something from the grocery with money back on an atm card to get money to pay for said meal
i was not happy
b
server started off okay and progressively became slower and slower until it ended in a trickle at the end of the night
read the next two to see our indicators
c
i ordered a thai tea in the middle of the meal and it just never came
d
i requested a refill on my water three times before we finally just signed the check and i picked_up a bottle of water next_door
i even requested it with the check
hey
can i get a refill of water and the check
samosa_factory just did not do it for me
which is a shame because the food is great
but i don't care how delicious cheap glorious the food is
because if the service leaves me feeling like the staff doesn't want my money
i'll go elsewhere
this place is great and a fine value
the food is great
the service is great and personal
i have been to somosa factory many times and always come away happy and full
went to lunch here a_few_weeks_ago with my two sisters and ordered a few samosas
the paneer makhini
garlic_naan
and the malai_kofta
it's very difficult to mess up these items in the first place
and they were all delicious
the only thing i didn't understand was that although we ordered it to be very spicy and high on the
thiku
scale
we received very mild dishes
the service was very nice
our glasses never went empty and i was a happy customer
despite the lack of spicyness
very friendly service and lovely food
we got the garlic_naan
lamb_curry
okra
and paneer mahkni
sauces were tasty and all was delicious
the rice_pudding with blueberry topping was divine
i'm lactose intolerant and ate nearly everything myself
holy cow
yeah
no kidding
the 'best rice_pudding in the world
' i concur
difficult to locate this place if you don't know where to look
it's in the strip_mall directly west of the panda express on sahara
the exterior isn't anything to write_home_about
but the interior is tastefully decorated and smells wonderful
i want more rice_pudding
i really like it here because
the food is excellent
really well spiced curries that aren't too oily
great naan
awesome samosas that are fried just enough and won't wreck you with too many potatoes
unpretentious
relaxing atmosphere that feels very hospitable but not too overwhelming
recommend the molai kofta curry and the tikka masalas
good times
i've never been let down at this place
in fact i now make it a weekly stop
as others have said
service is great and the owner is a great guy
my weekly meal is chicken samosas and lamb_vindaloo
hot
the garlic_naan is amazing also
this restaurant is wonderful
great service and amazing food
wonderful selections for vegans and vegetarians too
this restaurant is worth checking out
great spices and extremely flavorful
i have eaten here regularly for quite some time
the food is consistently delicious
my_favorite_dish is the lamb_curry lunch w garlic_naan and iced_tea
all their dishes are extremely good
and the owner is really nice
i often take friends and family when they visit from out of town
and they are always impressed
i think this place is a best kept secret in las_vegas
hands_down the best indian restaurant in las_vegas
rick makes me feel like an old friend as soon as i walk in the door
so my dining_experience is that much more enjoyable
cozy and relaxing decor and a menu that features staples such as tikka masala and lamb_curry
and of course plenty of vegetarian and vegan selections
my goal is to try everything on the menu
but lately i've just been having rick create a dish for me and i have yet to be disappointed
love_this_place
pretty damn good
the veggie_samosa was yums
great place
very small inside
only about tables
wonderful food
great owner
some of the best tandoori_chicken i have ever had
it was cooked perfect
and it was a to go order
i've had my eye on samosa_factory for some time
but finally got around to trying it last_night when our first choice for dinner was closed for the holiday
we entered the small dining_area and were greeted_by the incredibly friendly server
we told_him we wanted to order our food to go and he still offered us two glasses of water and a starter to nibble on while we perused the menu
we settled on the lamb_vindaloo and the chicken_tikka_masala
we also ordered some garlic_naan
our server was incredibly personable and offered us refills on our water while we waited as well as made some idle chit chat with us
once our food arrived
we paid our bill and off we went with our food
the server also offered us a to go menu for our return_visit
great customer_service
my fella and i dug into our meal as soon as we got home
the spice_level was just right
we ordered the medium spice_level to be on the safe side on our first visit
the garlic_naan was delicious and i really enjoyed the rice
the flavors were right on and i look_forward to a return_visit to hopefully eat in the restaurant and try some of their samosas
the food is not cheap
but i didn't feel it was overly expensive for the quantity and quality of food we got
definitely a great indian option in a town that is lacking
yummmmm
while my first experience was a little less than stellar
i can easily overlook it since the paneer is always fabulous
it's a bit far away for me so every time i come here
i stockpile paneer dishes like i'm preparing for nuclear war
the selection is really good
the prices are fairly standard for most of the local indian_restaurants
and it's never been less than delicious
in fact
i like it so much that even if the service sucked
which it does not
i would still come back
i think that says a lot
the garlic_naan is great and the veggie_samosas are to die for
i think about them way more than i should admit
the samosas are delicately crispy and the potatoes are fluffy and packed full of rich savory spices
samosa_factory has my vote for some of the best indian food i've had in a while
went there once and this place was amazing
staff was friendly and accommodating considering we had a gift_certificate that cut our check in half
i loved that this place was a supporter of npr which is where my friend got the gift_certificate
and we were not disappointed by the food either
we each got two samosa apps
the vegetarian_options and the fries
both were delicious
for main_course
she got the buttered chicken which she told me was good
and i opted for the paneer korma
which was cheese cubes in a coconut curry_sauce
delicious
the garlic_naan was also good and help me scoop up that delicious coco curry_sauce that i had left over
we were too stuffed for desert
but i'll be going back for samosas and dessert and i only hope my next experience with the service and food warrants me to keep this place at stars
p
s
oh and i believe the state of a bathroom can say a lot about a restaurant and this place keeps my faith in this theory alive
finally a chef who understands flavor
i have been to many indian_restaurants in many great cities
as well as india itself
most places over spice and use less than quality_ingredients
this place does neither
the food is quality and the taste is like being in india
the chef will cater to your liking if you prefer
he has some intense spices if heat is your favorite
but the food is good for all
decor
music
and ambiance all give you a sense of being right in the heart of true india
i found this place by accident but im really glad i did
great lunches specials and spicyness of food is just right
best indian food and workers are the nicest
i've been here several times for lunch in the last few years and i resent misti for saying that it's not the
best lunch decision
okay i don't really resent it because i see where she's coming from
but based_on my experiences it's still one hell of a lunch decision
i usually end up doing take out but have dined in as well
i've tried many items from the lunch_specials to the entrees and have never had anything i disliked
my favorite item
the baby spinach curry happens to reside on the lunch_special menu so bonus for me
with that you get a healthy serving of rice that you can smother with the tangy tomato curry_sauce the baby spinach will be drenched in
get it spicy
i find it most enjoyable when you get the perfect mix of curry and sweat dripping from one's brow
i also order a side of regular naan and substitute the ghee butter for evoo
dip that right into the curry or make a little pita out of it and go to town on it like i do
unless there are people watching
also a fan of their veggie_samosas
if you put it in the name of your restaurant
it better be good
and their chicken curry is good as well
oh and veggie kofta curry
i have no_idea_what exactly that is
but it was delicious
kinda like little vegetarian meatballs or falafel but in a delicious curry_sauce
rick is always great and i've never had an issue with the service
though on days where it's packed he can sometimes be stretched a little thin and it can take a little longer that way
as an aside i also once saw him go outside and lay the smackdown on a few crackheads that appeared_to_be camping outside of his door and blocking the entrance exit
so tip him well
i don't know what his breaking point is
the only thing i found okay was the garlic_naan
apart from that everything was pretty bland compared to what other indian_restaurants offer
i am an indian too and i would have to admit that it wasn't what i expected
there were no authentic spices which we use daily in our cooking
we had the mango yogurt
lassi
and the yogurt was spoiled
smelling sour and bad
however rick totally denied it saying
we make our own yogurt and ther eis nothing wrong with it
thats a lie
i am never going back to this place
there are so better places in vegas for indian food
try indian masala its great choice compared to its availability
the one thing i love about the samosa_factory is they no not use heavy oils to cook their food
i heard about from friends but trying it will make you never eat heavy weiged down indian food again
there veggie_samosas as so yummy
our picky yr old twins love them
highly_recommend this
off the strip
joint
it's tiny inside but worth it
this is the best indian food i've had since_moving to vegas years_ago
very small restaurant
always people dining
but never a wait
the owner server is very friendly and knowledgable
listen to his recommendations
you cannot leave without the chocolate cherry samosas
i'm not a fan of chocolate with fruit
but these were amazing
i love_this_place
while the service is sometimes a little on the slow side when they are busy
the food is always hot and fresh and delicious
the lunch_specials are a real deal
but the other regular menu offerings are also great
and i encourage you to venture off the lunch menu and try something different
the saag_paneer is always delicious
the curries are great
and the naan the perfect accompaniment to sop up the juice from whatever you have chosen to order
i also love how the owner always welcomes me back
and if he has not seen me in a while
gently chides me for it and encourages me back
try this little restaurant for wonderful indian food
and you_won't_be_disappointed
not recommended
i have ordered tandoori_chicken all over the world
i never had green tandoori_chicken
i asked the waiter of the order was mixed up and he said no
they do not use artificial color
i gave it a shot
horrible
real tandoori uses cayenne
turmeric
paprika and masala for the red color
then baked in a tandoor oven
i recommend they hire a real chef from india
i read so many rave reviews about the garlic_naan bread
the worst naan in my life
burnt
thin and taste of only garlic
if anyone knows a great indian restaurant
please tell me or invite me over for mom's cooking
this place is called samosa_factory for a reason
the samosas are amazing
they come with a tasty cilantro chutney and a tamarind_chutney
per order and they are a very good size
really worth the
price
they also have some unique items
such as masala fries covered in cilantro
onions
and come with a bbq cilantro ginger sauce
very tasty
i've never been impressed with their curries
a little bland for my taste
but they do have a lot of vegan_options
which is nice
staff has always been friendly
great place
oh
this place
it was this place that made me realize that sometimes the worst review has the most truth in it
i've never had such bland indian food
ever
as another reviewer said
i should have known from the type of customers in there
no indians
we ordered their masala fries
tikka masala
and a coconut shrimp dish
the fries were fine
tough to mess up fries
although they didn't have the distinct flavor they sounded like they would have
the other two dishes
i didn't know you could call the same dish under two different names
both looked the same
tasted the same
and were regretful the same
and it was just as expensive as a good indian restaurant
on the upside
the naan was good and the service was pleasant
great food and even better service
disappointing
i really wanted to like this place
it is the sorta divey feel i like in eateries
but the food was just not very good
i ordered the samosa_chaat and it could have been a great dish except at the last second the chef decided to add black pepper to the top
a lot of it
the basmati_rice was salty and over cooked
the paneer was a soggy mess with a weird texture and woeful lack of spice
the tandoori_chicken and garlic_naan were yummy
that's why it gets stars
but overall the food was not worth the cost
the shrimp korma and garlic_naan were amazing
great service and atmosphere
although we don't frequent indian_restaurants very often
we decided to pop in for a little snacky snack
we just needed something to hold us over for dinner
so we got the pakora
and chicken samosas
both dishes were very delicious crispy outside
soft and flavorful inside and the dips and chutneys were also addicting
looking_forward to returning to try other items when we're in the mood for some indian eats
aloha
food was ok
ordered to go and they got my order wrong
unfortunately i was already home and hungry
so i didn't turn back around
instead of cheeseburger samosa
i got a pastry filled samosa
instead of a veggie_samosa
i got some other chickpea veggie dish
chicken masala was pretty bland
i was really excited_to_try this place because of all the good reviews and recommendations
but i was left disappointed
husband and i ordered beef samosas
chicken_tikki marsala
lamb_curry
garlic_naan
and dessert samosa
the food was delicious
we enjoyed it very much
the service was great and our server was very friendly_and_attentive
we_will_definitely_be_back for more
the only negative i have was that when i asked for a straw
i was handed a cup full of unwrapped straws and asked to pick one
i cringe at the thought of how many dirty
unwashed hands have touched all those straws
ew
oh my gaga
this place is awesome
scrumptiously delicious food and the owners are very friendly and pleasant
they have vegetarian_vegan menu_items
a musttry recommendation
will be back for sure
wonderful
once again a new place to define by
awesome
best indian food anywhere
what can i say
this is not only my favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
this is my favorite restaurant anywhere
it is located on sahara avenue
very close to a lot of car dealerships
banks
insurance agencies
etc
so at lunch time you will find many people on their lunch breaks who work in the area
no buffet here
all food is made to order
fresh
and the way you want it
spicy
medium
mild
cream
no cream
etc so it is great for customizing
they have a page with about vegan_options
which is a rarity in itself for me
since i happen to be vegan
they of course also have many vegetarian
and non vegetarian_dishes you wont find on your typical menu along with all your favorites
oddly enough the owner is a quiet
white guy
not from india
yet he has mastered indian cooking more than anyone go figure
the food is the main thing and once you go there
there is no turning back to your typical buffet
there is a lunch menu
with about or choices
but you can also order off the regular part of the menu if you want to get a lot more options and the portions will be larger but cost more
the
paneer makhani
dish is just heavenly and is basically an orangey red colored thicker gravy like texture sauce with cheese cubes in it
since i am now vegan i do not order it but if you are vegetarian or even a meat_eater
you have to try this as one of your dishes
it is great for pouring over your rice or sopping up your plate with the naan or roti bread
everything is made right there
even the samosas
no frozen boxed samosas here
pakoras
and chutneys
not jarred like most places serve
are all made fresh here and delicious
the quality and pride that goes into each and every dish is such a delight
one wonders why many other indian_restaurants don't take note and try to step it up too
instead of serving so many oily
and in many cases
flavorless uninspired creations
if you think you are an indian food connoisseur
but you haven't yet tried samosa_factory
i strongly urge you to try it
and once you do
there is a good chance you wont want to go anywhere_else
and may find yourself becoming an instant regular
i swear he uses secret addictive ingredients in his dishes to keep customer craving and thinking of them all the time
wow
a local took me here last nite
my first time for indian food
believe me
i will definitely come back
great service and the chicken_korma and garlic_naan
out_of_this_world
everything i tasted was awesome and the staff was incredibly friendly and knowledgable
i highly_recommend stopping in
great food
great service
chicken_tikka was awesome with fresh peppers
iced_tea had a surprising and refreshingly different flavor
this place is the bombay digity
located on sahara and decatur
this small restaurant will give you a cultured taste_of_india
the place is small and very clean
which is a must in my restaurant world
i was greeted_by a very nice helpful waitress who took the time to explain their menu and the pronunciation of each dish
i ordered the spinach paneer
i'm a huge_fan_of spinach
and this put me into cloud
the dish consisted of spinach and tofu
and some type of sauce
im really clueless when it comes to indian food
i just ask what's in it and i eat it
haha
also along with the paneer i had the garlic_naan
it's good to have with your paneers they compliment each other
for dessert i had the keer
which was some sort of rice_pudding with berries on top very delish as well
samosa is also vegetarian_vegan friendly which is what drawn me to the place
me being a transitional vegetarian_vegan
i was curious what options i had in an indian restaurant
overall i was satisfied with the service and the food
they also have lunch_specials during lunch time
i did not even bother to look at that
but will give it a try when i go back
i am not well acquainted with indian food
as much as i like different ethnic foods i am quite wary of extremely spicy dishes
a friend_of_mine had been wanting_to_try this place out
but did not want to navigate the place alone
we went in and were seated quickly
it is a rather small place
but there was a mix of customers
some were business people while others were families
the atmosphere was nice and cozy and we quickly got comfortable
neither of us was particularly hungry and after getting drinks decided to ask the server for his advice
we decided on ordering a few different samosas
we had chicken
vegetable
and lamb
we also got an order or spiced fries
it was the perfect for the two of us
everything was delicious and we were checked upon often
i can't_wait_to_come_back with the boyfriend so that he may also experience this place
it looks like a great place to take a date
perfection
we discovered samosa by yelp's direction
ordered garlic_naan to start our session
the tandori_chicken is worth of a legend
the lamb saag will jolt your essence
the lamb kabob is no exception
believe it or not
i am of a different nation
my wife says samosa cures my retardation
this was my first time trying indian food i loved it
i can't_wait_to_go_back and try more things
the service was great as well
i would definatly recommend this to anyone who is trying for the first time great experience
i love this little place
the food is fantastic
the owner rick is very personable and makes it pleasant to eat here
i wish i could eat here days per week
i was visiting from philly and wanted delicious indian food for lunch
upon doing a google search
samosa_factory was the only place with excellent reviews so i tried it for myself
i was not disappointed
the guy who served me was so pleasant
the food came out in a short amount of time
i ordered a vegetarian dish with naan and iced chai
the flavors was so amazing
i loved that they give you just one heaping scoop of rice because i don't like too much of it
could only eat half my meal
so i was given a container for the food and a little bag for the naan and bonus
a to go cup for my iced chai
i found that to be very thoughtful
it isn't a big place but the decor is nice and warm
i wanted to go back before leaving but never got the chance
i highly_recommend this place
really
really
really cannot say enough about how much i love_this_place
the best indian food i have had in las_vegas by far
if you are new to indian food and want something different but tasty i can always recommend the lamb_korma
it's perfect
with a side of garlic_nan
some samosas
of course
and mango_lassi this is my favorite dinner
if i was on death row
i may very well pick samosa indian factory for my last meal
their restaurant is tiny
but i like it
it doesn't feel overly crowded but actually cozy
i really can't say enough good things about this place
ok place for groups
not that super for couples or singles
why wouldn't they offer a samosa with the thali platter
check their name
why not offer a better thali combo option
papadum
dessert samosa in the thali
found it to be a bit pricey for what it offers
such a great hardworking guy
do not miss the dried fruit stuffed naan
his apple chutney
or his samosas lots of terrific vegan dishes too
gluten_free
you've found a great place to enjoy delicious food safely
great naan
great food and service
loved the samosas
we got veggie and lamb
my preference was the veggie
the saag_paneer was tasty tasty but i wish i had a tiny salt shaker
blasphemy
garlic_naan
delish
the vegan roti
bread
and spinach tomato curry here were excellent
it was absolutely_delicious
unfortunately
you have to drive here
so it's not convenient if you are staying on the strip
it's in a strip_mall and easy to miss
oh samosa_factory
you have my heart and tummy
i have now eaten here almost every time that i've visited vegas
it's a must eat
i loooove the veggie choices and of course the garlic_naan
i can't decide which one is more wonderful
the owner or the food
you'll want to eat them both up
one tip
finish your meal off with the rice_pudding
absolutely_delicious
my go to place for indian food in vegas
it's one of those best kept secrets for indian food for vegas in my opinion
it's a casual ambiance place with great food that's reasonably_priced
i always get their naan_bread and paneer
i love it here also for their great vegetarian_options
love it
my new favorite spot in vegas
i go at_least_once_a_week
the malai_kofta korma is just delicious as well as the vegetable samosa's
garlic_naan and i'm sure everything else on the menu
cute little place
great service
and food to die for
thumbs_up
love the samosa_factory
the staff are delightful
food delicious such a pleasant atmosphere
i've taken family friends here everyone loved it
i'd recommend this to anyone looking for some delicious indian food
yelp you disappointed me tonight
you know if the restaurant is run by people whose ethnic background does not match the food
something is bound to go wrong
sorry
just a stereotype of mine i cannot break
anyways
we decided on indian for dinner tonight
and i suggested to try samosa_factory as i had bookmarked this place for quite some time
the restaurant had mostly positive_reviews which is what convinced me to stray from our usual indian_joint
the restaurant itself is small
definitely a
hole_in_the_wall
type of place
we were greeted_by this a large caucasian man
definitely not what i was expecting at an indian restaurant
not sure if he was the owner
but in addition to seating us
he took our order
and served us our meal
we order the chicken_tikka_masala
shrimp_vindaloo
and garlic_naan
both entrees served with basmati_rice
the chicken_tikka_masala was not what we were expecting
prepared completely different from any_other_indian_restaurant we've ever tried
i was expecting yummy curry_sauce
but this hardly had any
although it wasn't badly prepared
it just wasn't up to our liking
the shrimp_vindaloo was nothing spectacular either
this had more curry_sauce than the chicken_tikka_masala
but nothing impressive
i like curry_sauce to be thick
this was more watery
lastly
the garlic_naan and basmati_rice were just average
i didn't care of the naan because it was thin and dry as opposed to thick and fluffy like how we are used to having at mt
everest
sigghh
what a disappointing meal
sorry to say
we won't be coming_back
my favorite place in all of las_vegas
i only order things
so it's hard to rate it all
the veggie_korma and spinach curry
i love them both
the garlic_naan is covered in garlic and cilantro
it's delish too
my husband is not adventurous
he orders the chicken_tikka every time
getting him to even go in was a huge effort
now
most days it's his idea to eat here
i also highly_recommend iced chai_tea
we bought a groupon and thought this place must be awesome for all the great reviews_on_yelp
the place was certainly a hole_in_the_wall
the folks that work there were super_nice
we ordered a veggie_samosa which was great
we ordered chicken_vindaloo tasted bland and tomatoey
no real indian spices popping out or any hint of tartness
i'm from san_francisco and we dine at naan and curry all the time and their vindaloo was my gateway to indian_cuisine
i order it at other places and it's great
the chicken was half a breast cut into slithers
no real chunks of bone and meat
there were several pieces of potato in there
it was like half a potato all together
it tasted like a filipino goat stew but more bland
the lamb kabob was bland too
no real indian spices popping out
it was like one kabob cut into sauce like slices mixed in this tomatoey sauce with red peppers
it was sweet and bland
the samosa was great but i couldn't taste any heart in the meal
no tart
no spices
the people that worked there were again very nice and great at explaining things and talking with us
it was quiet pricey too
wish i had known how small and quick this restaurant was
it definitely would not have been my choice for my anniversary dinner
flat naan
bland samosa_chaat
good lamb_vindaloo
oh i just remembered we ordered pakoras too
and those tasted like fried nothing
was excited for the spices and the textures or the onion
cauliflower
and potato but this was just potato hash
the flavor came from the chutneys
i was also very sad that we were in and out in minutes and we were trying to eat slowly
everything came out in minutes and our mango_lassi was delicious
but i wish it were cold
the temp made it just seem like a bowl of yogurt in a tall glass
my boyfriend and i have been spoiled by eating some really authentic and great indian food and these were our favorite dishes there
wasn't terrible
but won't be back
i miss this place sooooo much
it's honestly deliciousness in the best way
the kashmiri naan filled with dates cannot be rivaled
and the veggie dishes are ridiculous
i'm so happy to see this place thriving
it's quaint atmosphere and mood lighting on a friday_night is perfect
and i'm excited to enjoy this wonderful place again
delicious
my husband and i were in las_vegas for a few days and purchased several groupons to try while in town
samosa_factory has become one of our favorite indian places
we had a chicken samosa
chicken_tikka_masala
saag_paneer
and plain_naan
the chicken samosa was packed with flavor and very fresh
the chicken_tikka_masala was not as sweet as we liked
but still fantastic
the saag_paneer was more saucy than other_indian_places
regardless
we really liked the dish
the service was absolutely fantastic and topped off the wonderful night
i'd definitely recommend_this_place
really great service
food very flavorful and fresh
made to order
owner is very nice and accommodating
bernie hanna
i have brought my friends and family here and they absolutely agree with me
food is amazing and so is the service
it's a perfect place to come if you're a vegan vegetarian
i'll be coming_back whenever i get a chance
i was truly excited_to_try samosa_factory after reading the rave reviews and receiving a recommendation from a friend
since their page states that they do not take reservations
i figured it would be a casual establishment and that coming with a group wouldn't be an issue
when we arrived
the restaurant was empty with just one pair dining
the gentleman that greeted us was accommodating in bringing tables together for us
however
it seemed like he had expected us to call ahead and made a comment about our group size
adding that it was a good thing it was early
pm
we thought this was odd given the
no reservations
situation
when most of our group arrived
we were approached by the same gentleman to take drink_orders
then
when we had everyone
he came to take our appetizer order
since i was at the other end of the table near the kitchen
i couldn't hear him
nor did he make an effort to be heard
he stood at the end of the table and didn't bother coming around or closer to the other end
he didn't smile once
he was lukewarm
and seemed bothered
he acted the same way as our evening continued
seeming unhappy to even serve us
we didn't feel very comfortable or welcome
the same gentleman was very warm and friendly to a couple that sat_down at the table next to us
even sitting with them for a moment
so it was apparent that he was capable of these positive behaviors
it was just odd
there was another young woman that assisted us as well and thankfully
she was kind
food wise
my fianc and i ordered lamb samosas
garlic_naan
and butter_chicken
makhani
we also tried the tandoori_chicken
lamb_korma
and quesadilla naan from our friends
everything was okay unimpressive and not as good as what i've had at other indian_restaurants
i was really disappointed with the chicken_makhani because that's one of my favorite indian dishes and this version didn't do it any justice
also
i wasn't wow ed by the samosas or the chutney
the quesadilla naan was surprisingly good and i liked the tandoori_chicken
unfortunately
my experience wasn't a good one with disappointing food and service
my friends and i still enjoyed ourselves
so it wasn't a complete disaster
by the way
the restaurant didn't fill up in the two hours we were there
so there were no issues with space
this casual
table restaurant was busy on this thursday evening
but we lucked out by securing a table
the owner provided menus with us choosing to share orders of lamb spinach
butter_chicken and kashmiri naan
the lamb was tender
but the spinach was on the runny side
the chicken in the butter_chicken was on the tough side
overall our meal was pretty good
but a notch below the best so our search for a great indian restaurant in las_vegas continues
a rating of
would be appropriate
went to the samosa_factory with a dear friend for lunch
she was greeted_by the staff and we were ushered to her usual table by the window
the server was courteous and attentive
unfortunately
the fare was not as commendable
i ordered the lamb_curry
lunch_special
a hot chai_tea
and vegetable chaat samosa
the chaat arrived first
a heaping plate of green chutney
creamy yogurt
and innumerable other colors and flavors
the chaat was just okay
try the chaat at mount_everest down the road to see what real chaat should taste like
the chai_tea arrived after
a big steaming cup with a dollop of curdled cream floating on top
this was so disappointing
it is impossible to find good chai in las_vegas
does not taste like indian chai_tea
next the lamb_curry arrived with a heaping scoop of jasmine rice
it was bland and unenjoyable
my friend enjoyed her chicken_tikka_masala and naan
i tried the naan and it was hot and fresh
though a bit thin and crispy
there are too many excellent indian food options in las_vegas to return to samosa_factory
i had real bad experience at this place
person catering the customers at this restaurant has no respect for his customer what so ever
he had shown such an attitude that we all decided to walk away from that place
all we asked for is a separate check before we placed an order
and the guy was completely rude
i will never go to that place again nor will recommend to anyone
there are many better indian_restaurants_in_town who cares for customers and serves way better food than this place
i would rate this place zero star if i could but unfortunately yelp is not having that option
if you don't care about your customers someone else will
enjoy
i found out about samosa_factory through a groupon special
we arrive mins before closing time
we ordered delicious spice fries
lamb
soup and chicken
all were well presented and tasty
by_far_the_best_indian restaurants_in_vegas
our server gave_us a full size rice to take home with our leftovers
very thoughful
you do not need to be on the strip to get great personal service
wonderful spot
i suggest everyone try it
the service is attentive and friendly
food is prepared fairly quick and includes a wide_selection_of great tasting vegetarian and vegan dishes
it's a nice
cozy cute spot for people
has takeout available also
want to eat at a place where the food is consistently delicious
this is the place
my family and i have been here times now and it never disappoints
all times we have been served by the owner who is amazing
great service and he called my daughter by name all night
which she loved
samosas are incredibly delicious
we had the beef and lamb this time
i swear
one day i'm getting like of these and that's all
my husband had the chicken curry extra_spicy
my daughter and i shared the tikka masala very mild
portions are big and we had some left over
the naan is cooked_to_perfection
i suggest ordering lots
as it's perfect for sopping up the sauce from your meal
my family and i will be back again and again and i suggest you go too
best_indian_food_i've_ever_had in my life
not greasy
fresh
full of flavor
my boyfriend who hates indian food
loved it
and now wants to go back
amazing vegan vegetarian menu
no other place in vegas like it
i've been going to this restaurant off and on for years
amazing food
that's all i can say
wow wow wow
i couldnt have better things to say
we ordered and shared three entrees
they were all amazing
service was outstanding
food was outstanding
and location is easy_to_find
this is a must try
i've read plenty of good reviews about samosa_factory and true to story you can't_go_wrong coming here
upon walking in my husband and i were greeted and seated
the owner and waitress was very nice and had good suggestions for the menu
we ordered
chicken_korma
lamb_vindaloo
garlic_naan and onion kulcha
we were given mango_lassi to try
everything was absolutely_amazing
the service was excellent
i will_be_going_back for sure
best indian food ever
it's clean
fresh
and so flavorful
in a little out of the way spot totally unassuming
had chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
chicken_korma
roti
samosas
and chai
all was unbelievable
we're so happy
not too keen on taj indian
based_on one visit
two words
scary bathrooms
you have to walk down a long hallway at the back of the building to get there it's right out of a david lynch movie
two more words
slow service
we had to practically beg a server to wait on us
and there wasn't a big crowd to justify the wait
the food was good
but i would much rather go to one of the indian_restaurants on state street before going here again
i've been to taj times and have been consistently pleased
i've never had slow service
it's always been very prompt and incredibly pleasant
they bring you a neat little trifecta of sauces to use on your crispy bread starter
i'm actually not sure i've ever gotten anything other than their saag_paneer
i dream about their saag_paneer on my lonelier nights
but maybe someday
firstly
i should say this place does have delivery
in fact
more and more restaurants are offering a rd party delivery service called straighttoyourdoor
com
they are one such place at the moment
i have gone here a few times
dinner and lunch
the dinner experience i found slightly slow
even though nobody is there
maybe its based_on the way they prepare food or something but it feels like you wait forever
even with an appetizer
i still waited a while after finishing it for my main_course
lunch is where it is at
for
they have a lunch buffet that includes naan
if you wanted to be el cheapo
if you forgo a drink
that is under
i believe with a drink
it goes slightly over
but still
that is cheap for a lunch
it's a great way to introduce others to indian food or give yourself an opportunity to explore other things you might not otherwise order for dinner
i find the wait_staff very friendly and you can tell they take pride in their restaurant
went there for brunch yesterday
sat
two words
stay_away
yes
the owners look friendly
but if its good indian food you're looking for
taj is a big let down
the brunch menu was sparse
most dishes watered_down
tasted nothing like they should
food didn't taste fresh to make it worse my glass_of_water had stuff floating in it
i always get the chicken_tikka_masala and it's always delicious
the staff is pleasant and i haven't had a bad experience
the price is a bit steep
but it's worth it for the occasional dinner splurge
taj serves up the best indian dinner in all of madison
i have been on several occasions and have always enjoyed all aspects of my night out
the restaurant itself is pretty small but very well lit and cheery
there have been several other groups dining during my visits
but i have never had to wait_for_a_table
the staff is always attentive but never in the way
the complimentary poppadom with three chutneys is a great way to start the meal off
all three chutneys are very flavorful and completely different from one another
the chai is wonderful
i'm pretty sure it's made with cream
great naan too
for the main_course
my favorite is the vegetable_korma
it's the perfect combination of creamy and spicy
i am a little skeptical that the vegetables were frozen minutes before the reached my plate
but who's to care if it still tastes like heaven on earth
the saag_paneer was also very good
i have yet to try taj's lunch buffet
but if the food is anything like it is for dinner
i'm pretty sure i won't be disappointed
i'm reviewing this place since it's the best indian restaurant in madison
but my review applies to all the other ones in the city
if you crave real indian food
i would highly_recommend you stay_away_from this place
the food in their buffet is very watered_down to cater to american tastes since there's practically no spiciness or flavor to anything in their buffet
heck
even the watered_down indian food places in san_francisco are more spicy
and better
than this place
however
like any_other_indian_restaurant in madison
this place has cheap reasonably_priced buffet lunch_specials which makes it worth a visit if you happen to be starving and in the area
but if you have any real expectations about indian food in the region
you're better off trying your luck in milwaukee or chicago instead
first to arrive for the lunch buffet
so the food din't sit for long
literally had one of everything
i shouldn't be allowed at buffets
so i got a good sense of what they had to offer
the good
pakora
the vegetable
cauliflower
was better than the fish or chicken
crispy well seasoned
saag_paneer
creamy
thick rich
but not excessively so
kofta
nice soft texture
good flavor
well sauced
gulab_jamun
not offensively sweet
good texture
kheer
same as above
the just okay
samosas
garlic_naan
basmati_rice were fine but unremarkable
watery dishes
chicken curry
chicken_tikka_masala
dal
raita
would have been much better if the sauce had the consistency of the saag_paneer
the wtf
beef at an indian restaurant
no lamb
no spice heat
bathrooms are kinda retro but not scary
i recently just got back from a trip to india
jaipur
rajasthan
and the dishes listed under 'good' above were comparable
at less than
it was a great deal and will be back
admittedly
i've never had the lunch buffet
as for the dinner menu
though
delicious
the boy and i eat there at_least_once_a_week
often twice
we go through withdrawals if we're away too long
since we're both veg n
i can only attest to the vegetarian offerings
but between the two of us
i think we've had everything in the veg section
and we've never had a bad meal here
every plate has the option of mild medium spicy
and extra rice is always available free
even when you take half of the food home
as i usually have to do
the portions are perfect in that
if you're like him
it's a perfect stomach stuffer and if you're like me
i always have leftovers for the next day
particularly good dishes are the baingan bhartha
vegetable mango
and bhindi_masala
the cheese eating boy swears by the saag mushroom and paneer jalfrazie
the samosas are wonderful
and the onion chutney is always amazing
be sure to add a taj_mahal beer for the perfect meal
the prices are great
two meals
an appetizer
and a couple of drinks comes to less than before tipping
the service is always prompt and friendly
and while the atmosphere is casual
we often venture in in hoodies and jeans
you could easily make it a nice date outing
the lighting is soft and the decor nice enough
taj is an all around great establishment with a great family_owned feel that's friendly without being overbearing
we recieved superb service and memorable food here
rice
papadum
and a chutney assortment were all included with our meal
which i don't recall always being the case at local indian_restaurants
we will certainly return
the lamb_vindaloo here is delicious
nice interior and great service
i want to give it five_stars
i went here easily times over the past three years
i've been here for both the all_you_can_eat lunch and dinner
dine in and dine out
i really like the people who own and run the restaurant
and i would love to see them keep dishing out food for years to come
but despite my loyalty
i just can't go above three stars
first of all
it is pretty pricey
and up for entrees
and an extra
for the almost obligatory naan
for plain
granted
it's a lot of food you get a big serving of rice along with a large
generous portion of meat and curry
but it's madison
i can eat at some places very close for under
second
i know it's recycled lunch items on me for dinner take out
it's not hard to tell
dried_out
reheated naan just doesn't taste like it does when it's piping_hot out of the tandoori oven
i'm pretty sure i've had reheated lunch servings of curry as well
it didn't happen every time
but it happened enough that i decreased my visits
lunch is probably better than dinner
with a big selection to choose from
and all of the food is good
i'd definitely recommend it for lunch
i feel like the chef needs to go on
kitchen nightmares
the food is great
but it just seems like somewhere along the grind of maintaining a restaurant the owners chefs lost their passion
gordon ramsey
make them whole again
then maybe i can come back and update my posts after i get some fresh cooked food at a reasonable_price
yum
i have never really had indian food before and me and my man went for the lunch buffet
it is an buffet and while it is not huge
what it had was diverse
at least for me
i was up for trying anything
which i did and it was all good
i loved the samosas and i dipped them in a yogurt_sauce that they had available
i tried vegetable_korma which was tasty with just enough heat
and saag_paneer
which was different but still good
my favorite was probably the vegetable_pakora
and of course
the naan
i also tried the desserts
which weren't my cup of tea but interesting
they have a gelatinous dessert called gulab_jamun and i found out that it is soft fried_cheese balls
i didn't love them
but i did love_this_place
ah i miss this place
it was my favorite place to have indian food in all of wisconsin
service was exceptional
and the food was beyond great
the price is reasonable and we went there a million times with no hiccups
the only weirdness is having to use the restroom
it's so far away
and that it is on the ever unpopular park street
don't let that deter you
it is so worth it to dine here
a good place for date or family adventure
i am not a buffet person so i cannot tell you if that is good or not
but the meals are insanely delicious
love_this_place
i would give ten stars if i could and signed up for a yelp account just so i could share my awesome find with others
hands_down some of the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
and i lived in india
great
friendly and fast service in a cozy atmosphere
i've been for dine in dinner and take out and have never been disappointed
their prices are incredibly reasonable i highly_recommend the combination dinners they have a vegetarian or meat combo that includes three curry type dishes
nan
rice
pakora appetizer and dessert for under
the chicken_tikka_masala is incredible like everything else
they give you generous portions
enough for at least another whole meal at home
yum
the only draw back is that the are a little off the beaten path on s
park but well worth the extra five or ten_minutes out of your way
wow
this place is a great pick for that night time date
family get together or just some place great last minute
the buffet of course is the best but the evening menu is delicious
i had a spicy lamb dish and my daughter had an amazing crab crepe
over the top good
lovely and elegant place but modestly priced
no other place to go for lunch or dinner
a must
great dinner
good service
i'm not sure what made me think of this place today
but i miss eating there
good food and the folks who own it are a real pleasure
it's not that indian food in philly is terrible but it ain't great neither
glad to see taj is still doing
ever since my husband took me to my first indian_buffet_in_town
i've been trying other places like it
today we went to the taj
and i was pretty excited
it was very cozy
and the staff was so friendly
but as far as food selection and food quality
definitely not worth it
the one fish dish they had was so dry
i could barely chew it
and this was only an_hour after they'd opened today
so you'd think it would've been fresh
i would not recommend this indian buffet
and would instead direct others to either a
swagat on old sauk rd or b
maharini on west washington ave
i don't think i'll be back to the taj though
good buffet
good service
good prices
and the food is stars
my favorite can't miss meal is the butter_chicken and naan
stars
amazingness
i used to come here when i was at university and nothing has changed
my friends and i ordered samosas
garlic_naan
chicken_vindaloo
chicken_tikka
masala
and chana_masala
no complaints
very tasty
now i noticed a few people complaining about the price
but to cook these sauces and samosas at home takes more money than you'd_expect
also it's a lot cheaper_than other cities
bonus
lunch buffet
if you want some yummy indian_cuisine try taj
love taj
lunch buffet is a great value and the food is delicious
madison has some very good indian food options
and this is one of the best
i have eaten here about times and gotten take out maybe another
great indian food
excellent service
and a nice setting
you know those places that have stuff hanging off the ceiling but it is greasy and has cobwebs
well this isn't it
taj os bright and cheerful and c l e a n
the vegetarian and
meatatarian
specials are both good
ask to upgrade the basic naan for a small upcharge to garlic or ginger
the indian wine
which i had never had before going here
was impressive
lighter fruits and various floral flavors blend beautifully and pair nicely with the dishes
and the wine is very reasonably_priced
oh
and the only tandoori i have ever had that is moist too many are dired out
overall a wonderful value
and nice enough you could make it a special event dinner
the place is quite nice in appearance and seemed very clean
the food was hot and the buffet was kept stocked nicely
the food wasn't bad but wasn't that good either
when i think of indian food
i want a depth of flavor
some intensity
the food here was none of that
it was even somewhat bland
the chicken masala had nice chunks of white breast meat
but there was hardly any spice in it
seemed like midwestern chicken gravy
and the beef curry was just as flavorless
the nana bread was good as was the rice brian's
but that was about it
ordered takeout from this restaurant
the food was great
had the chef selection
which comes with three entree choices of the chef
try the peshwari_naan
the chopped raisins give the naan a unique
subtle sweetness that goes very well with curries
all the curries i have tried are incredibly flavorful and well balanced
their lamb is so tender
like almost all indian_restaurants they can't cook the meat directly in the sauce since there are so many different sauces
but this lamb is very delicious in its own right
same goes for the fish and chicken
favorite curries so far
lamb mughlai
chicken_korma
really enjoyed the food and the experience
super_nice staff
easy to get in and out of the parking_lot
reasonable_prices
super yum
yum
yummy
i got taj delivered to my apartment last_night as i didn't feel like venturing out to a restaurant
it was super fast and arrived piping_hot
i was very impressed
i got the matter_paneer and it was the best i have ever had
super flavorful
the rice is also delicious as was the naan
i got an order of plain_naan this time but would try a new flavor next time
one thing i would note for next time is that the dinner options come with a side of rice
i didn't realize this as most places i have been to everything comes a la_carte
so i ordered an extra order of rice but like i said it is delicious so i'm not complaining
what are people giving good ratings talking_about
for starters
the bathroom was disgusting
flies everywhere
there are some in the main restaurant
too
they left the tikka massala unfilled until several people finally asked for it
the naan was obviously just heated up in a microwave
it was also pretty cold
yuck
i go here when i don't go to the square for the other_indian_places
always my favorites are the chicken_tikka_masala and carrot_halwa
the mango_ice_cream is always good
the chutneys are varied but mango_chutney is extra
the naan could be better
the only other negative is the restroom
its unpleasant
taj is consistently fabulous
we always get the chicken saag
baingan bharta
and lots of naan
the naan is flaky
not like a flat pancake as we've had at other indian_restaurants
there's plenty of chicken in the saag
and the baingan bharta is full of vegetables and flavor
very good quality and nice portions
especially with take out
even though it takes us minutes to get to taj
this is our new indian restaurant of choice
i ordered delivery when i was in town and got the vegetarian combo dinner
the delivery was fast and everything was delicious
i will definitely order from here again next time i'm in town
hands_down my favorite indian food in madison
can't_go_wrong with the naan or tikka masala
they offer delivery
which comes with slightly larger portions than dine in
very tasty and good prices on the buffet
the only tiny drawback is the mazelike path to the restroom
but i didn't come for the potty
i came for the samosa
bring it on
i am relatively inexperienced with indian food
and as someone who is very picky with food i am unfamiliar with
my experience here was pleasant
service was quick and we were seated promptly
my so and i came on a quiet afternoon after he stated he was craving some indian food
there were only about other people in the restaurant so it was pretty quiet
i had no clue what the chutney was for
and i didn't like the aftertaste of papadum
just in general
so i just waited for my order for the tikka masala and mango_lassi
the naan and my mango_lassi came first
the latter being very delicious
i don't like the taste of naan
but their tikka masala and the rice were excellent
the chicken was tender and i couldn't get enough
so as far as service and the quality of the food i ordered
i was very satisfied
i went to taj on friday driving all the way from middleton to way with my friends who work at uw
when i stepped inside the restaurant i can barely see any customers
we went for the buffet and it was horrible
all the dishes seems to be horrible they didn't look fresh at all
only thing i liked is samosa which seems to be freshly_made
i went to dhaba
minerva and swagat on west side and taj seems to the worst of all
i will never goto this place and wouldn't recommend to my friends
stay_away_from this restaurant
maharaja is my favorite place in madison for indian food
ok
now i'll tell you why
maharaja produces some of the highest quality and most consistently good food in madison
the lunch buffet can be a bit spotty
but the last two times i've been there the selection was plentiful and tasty
dining there or for take out
the food is the same
i've never been unpleasantly surprised by the quality of the food
i have made it a point to try a new dish on a regular_basis
i have yet to find a curry
with or without meat
that failed to please me
the aroma of the food is what draws me in
my most frequent comment about the food is that
it's like eating flowers
you can smell as well as taste the various spices in the curries and other dishes at maharaja
the atmosphere of the restaurant is a bit odd
it looks like it used to be a 's or 's supper club
not exactly what you would expect for an indian restaurant
the service is very good
the waiters are courteous and attentive
they don't hover yet i don't have to go looking for them when i need something
the weekend lunch buffet is one of the best i've ever seen
huge selection of really tasty indian food
the menu also delves into southern indian_cuisine which i've_never_seen elsewhere
the servers actually care whether you're happy and do a good job
like others have mentioned
the atmosphere is a little bizarre but the very diverse crowd usually dining there makes it feel like a 'big city' restaurant
one_of_my_favorites in madison
did i mention that its cheap
we missed the lunch buffet that we had heard so much about and went right to dinner
we ordered six dishes for three adults and one kid
the food was fantastic and flavorful
though the kid who was with us was very unimpressed with the exception of the mango_lassi
the big surprise came at the end when we got the bill and it was over dollars
yowzers
while the food was good
there wasn't a whole lot of it
so the bill was a bit shocking
but don't let the cost of dinner detour you if_you_are_looking for excellent indian food
this place has got it
so go early and hit the lunch buffet instead
this place is unreal
i had lunch there yesterday on the recommendation of these reviews
it was better than i'd hoped
all of the food on the buffet was fresh
hot and tasty
service was very good as well we'll_definitely_be_back again
and again
i'm a huge_fan_of this place
this is serious tandoori goodness
their tikka masala is amazing too
you know
i am usually highly suspicious of buffets
i took microbiology in college
and really
it was enough to scare me away from buffets forever
i'd almost rather eat off a toilet seat than a buffet
that being said
the buffet at maharaja rules
i really always thought i hated indian food
because i don't like curry
i usually stick to tandoori_chicken and the bread
last time i went
i got
adventurous
and tried the tikka masala
yum
i also love those little balls soaked in syrup
so
i tried other things too
like little veggie fritters and palak_paneer
i am also now addicted to mango_lassis
the staff_is_very_friendly
and thankfully
keeps the buffet fresh
this is one buffet i can't_wait_to_come_back to
i moved into the madison area just last week
and after hearing rumors about the spectacular lunch buffet at the maharaja
i needed to try it for myself
suffice it to say that i was in no way disappointed
i showed_up to the restaurant at
this afternoon
with an entire minutes to spare before the buffet officially closed
even so
the hot food was still hot
the cold food cold
and absolutely everything was extraordinarily delicious
and i would know of course i had to try a bit of it all
the waiters themselves were very polite and attentive
which i generally do not expect at anything that even resembles a buffet not to mention when someone shows up minutes before the meal should be over
all in all
this experience alone was enough to inspire delight in my new wisconsin home
i look_forward to finding the many other edible treasures that madison surely has to offer
but i will most certainly be passing up more than a few meal opportunities to come back to this wonderful downtown diner
the new madisonian
p
s
they've also got free wireless
oh_yeah
maharaja's lunch buffet is very good offering a lot of options at a great price
i have been a couple_of_times when the food was not as good as at other times
but all in all a good place to eat
and you have to have their chai_tea
i've never been to india or had chai_tea other than at american places
but this tasted authentic and very yummy
the buffet was very good and had a huge selection
even for a vegetarian
there is an entire dessert table
with half a dozen to choose from
i do however like indian food to be a bit spicier
the restaurant is huge and it is good for large groups
the best indian buffet out there
excellent value for your money
the service is outstanding as well
many of the employees recognize and remember regular customers
an altogether memorable experience
every time
peter
who is indian by ethnicity
and gets out there when homesick
or just sick of home food
i stopped in for dinner while i was in madison for training
now i must say
i am a sucker for indian_buffets
i love them all
even if i don't know the name of any of the dishes
so it was a feat that on this night
it was the first time i was actually picking out individual entrees
i read the takeout menu about times until i saw a couple of things that looked familiar
i felt_like a nervous little school boy taking my first test
finally i just went up to the waiter at the desk and asked for his recommendations
a few minutes_later
chicken_tikka_masala
nan and samosas were ordered
then the waiter gave me crayons and a coloring book and told me to go play
just kidding
the food turned_out_to_be really good
samosas were really flavorful and not too greasy
it went well with the sauces that were provided green mint
sweet diced tomato and a plum
sauce
nan was on par
with the high recommendation of the chicken_tikka_masala
i expected to be knocked out
instead i just got pimp slapped across the face
it was still good but not star good
overall
this was a definite good find
i will surely update my review once i hit up the lunch buffet
excellent weekend buffet best assortment of high_quality food i have seen in an indian buffet and very reasonable_price
i highly_recommend this to everyone
i am a believer
i finally got to try the buffet
let_me_tell_you
if eating until it hurts is wrong
i don't want to be right
they had all the staples
tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
as well as some new items i've never tasted
chicken was the most notable kinda like crunchy bite size pieces of tandoori_chicken
except spicier
dessert didn't dissapoint either
there were at least you could pick from
the most notable were the mango_ice_cream and carrot_halwa
note
lack of samosas and palak
spinach
paneer didn't push my rating to a
there is hope
however
i did go on a thursday for the lunch buffet
the weekend buffet is supposed to have more offerings
both dishes that i was able to try were pretty mediocre
i had a curry dish and the llamb was tender
but the sauce was really average
my husband had lamb kebab and didn't even finish half of it
the best thing we had was the peshwari_naan
but overall we wouldn't go again
one of the best restaurants_in_madison
the buffet is amazing and the service is consistently top_notch
they have some standard dishes on the buffet but also rotate through specials
especially on weekends
i've never had something bad
it is refreshed often and
as someone else has already mentioned
hot food is always hot and cold food is always cold
my favorite dishes
aloo_gobi
aloo chole
and mutter_paneer
i love that they have a full range of items from nice crispy appetizers through to a great dessert selection
i think the gulab_jamun is probably my favorite but the semolina cake is also fabulous
and the mango_ice_cream
i highly_recommend going for lunch and skipping breakfast and dinner
d
i'm afraid i've never ordered off the menu or been there for dinner so i can't comment on that
the price of the buffet is fantastic
especially given that you get to try so many tasty dishes
so i've never been tempted to try the menu
easily my favorite restaurant in madison
very attentive waitstaff
i've never had a dish here that i didn't like
i went here once
and i was very impressed
i'm not the biggest fan_of_indian_food
prefer thai
but they may be turning me
too bad it's on_the_west_side
known at best indian in madison
no much on atmosphere perhaps but crazy good food
the service is great very nice staff
the food is okay probably some of the best in madison
but not excellent
we usually get the chicken_makhani which is the best dish we've found
the tikka masala is alright not great
the naan and paratha are good
i am a sucker for buffets
indian_buffets take it to a whole nother level
i have been here before for a
work
trip
last visit
i was probably hungrier than this past one
but i digress
maharaja had all the indian bites that i crave sag paneer
chicken masala
samosas mmmmmmm
they also had some pieces i was not familiar with chicken
ok
and since when is general tsao's chicken considered indian
whatever
i'll eat it
all dishes were pretty good
but since we were there towards the end of the buffet
the chicken dishes were a little on the dry side
the desserts however
were enough to keep me coming_back for more literally
pistachio ice_cream
mango_ice_cream
pudding type thing
sweet donut hole
done
definitely would want to go back here when in the area
muy rico
is good food
good flavor and different
the service is good and very politte
very good desserts
the restaurant was clean
the staff pleasant
the food was a little bland for my taste
perhaps they were catering to a more mainstream crowd but i prefer my indian dishes to have a little kick to them
especially the saag_paneer
they didn't have as large a selection as i'm used to at the indian_restaurants in los angeles
i won't totally discredit them
but couldn't offer up stars either
i'd say give them a try and see what you think
about years_ago i tried an indian buffet restaurant
in a different state and not related to this restaurant
i disliked the food so much that it's taken me that long to even try indian food again and boy am i glad i was able to try again here at maharaja's restaurant
we were looking for
something different
to eat on a late sunday_night they are open daily until pm
we were a party of four consisting of two middle aged adults with our
kids
age and
if you're in the mood for something quicker they also offer a lunch buffet daily
the atmosphere was beautiful chandeliers
white tableclothes
candles on the tabletops
authentic yet subtle indian music played softly in the background
the waiter put the napkins into our laps very classy
before we went i had looked over the online menu
great descriptions and pictures
so i already had some idea of what i wanted which made it easier than guessing in person
our waiter was very helpful in advising my year_old daughter on what dish she might enjoy
my son is a vegetarian and was impressed by the selection the rest of us are not vegetarians and we were also impressed by the selection
we would call this food
cruise quality
back when that really meant something that is
it was awesome and out_of_this_world great
we all took turns sampling each other's meals
which were served in individual serving bowls
the dishes we ate were
beverages
mango shakes
very unusual and refreshing especially after a spicy bite of something
and masala tea
sweet hot tea drink very similar to chai
fresh glasses of ice water were automatically given and refreshed frequently
appetizers
complimentary
daal poori
fried lentil bread
think of this kind of like tortilla chips in a mexican restaurant crispy but with a different
but very tasty
flavor
this was served with three different_types_of dipping_sauces
pickles these are not any ordinary 'pickles
' this was very salty and unusually flavored with spices like corriander and chili powder
we were told some of the ingredients included vegetables
green mango chunks
and some type of indian fruit
the piece i ate reminded me somewhat of olives only saltier and stranger
unfortunately most of us did not appreciate this dish but the good news is it only cost
to try it
very salty and somewhat spicy
cheese pakora flat cheese that has been breaded and fried tasty though reminiscent of tofu and or fried chicken
not spicy
samosas spicy turnovers stuffed with potatoes and green peas mixed reviews the men in our party enjoyed them more than the women did
yes they were a bit spicy
soups
s
o
had the mulligatawny soup it's made with lentils and vegetables and has an unusual spicy flavor and topped with a bit of cilantro
very good with the lemon squeezed into it
i felt it was somewhat reminiscent of a granular pea soup
it had a little kick to it
somewhat spicy
the three others of us had coconut soup sweet and creamy warm soup with shredded coconut and pistachios
daughter felt it
reminded her of christmas
i think perhaps it reminded her of eggnog in a way similar comfort level but different taste
sweet not spicy
for breads we tried plain paratha
similar to a thick wheat tortilla
and the garlic_nan it was extra super garlicky and tasty
neither spicy
our meals were served with a large bowl of long grained rice for us all to share
we were given a choice of spice_levels from mild to hot
beef jalfrazie
beef curry with various vegetables
chicken_tiki madras
tomato curry base with coconut from southern india
vegetable_curry
stir fried medley with curry_sauce
and i indulged myself in a decadent special of the day
tandoori lobster
spiced lobster tail cooked in a high heat pressure type cooker called a tandoor oven
we all tried each other's dishes and each was enjoyed by all
my
mostly
vegetarian son even snuck in a bite of lobster
none of the entrees seemed too spicy for us
even though we were stuffed and had leftovers we knew we
had to
have desert
daughter opted for the gulab_jamun
also called 'waffle balls'
sweet fried dough balls covered in a rosewater syrup
was reminiscent of perhaps pancakes with syup or cobbler but of course with a different flavor
we were very impressed with the kulfi a sweet custard like ice_cream made with pistachios and almonds
the staff_was_very_friendly and kind answered all of our questions with patience and care
helping us throughout the evening to get the best meal possible
to top the evening off the waiter brought us all hot damp washclothes for our hands
what exemplary service and attention
dinner for the four of us came to a bit over plus a tip which seems very reasonable for the amount of food we ate plus leftovers
fit for royalty
i highly_recommend majaraja restaurant anytime
i soooo didn't want to eat here but was kind of peer pressured into it
i was really afraid of what i would get at a wisconsin indian restaurant next to a hotel
i was happy to be proven wrong
this was one of the best indian_restaurants i have been to
there were awards all over the walls that showed just how awesome everyone_else thinks maharaja is as well
i split a samosa
the chicken
an order of keema nan and lamb moghlai with the bf
the appetizers were all good but not worth finishing
what was amazing was the keema nan and the lamb
i mean they were out_of_this_world delicious
the lamb could have been a little spicier but that was our fault since we were being little chickens and didn't say to make it spicy
i would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who finds themselves in madison and searching for something exciting and delicious to eat
madison wisconsin is not a place one would figure for great indian food
but there are some serious gems here
i love_this_place
after a day of shopping or a cheap movie
we often found ourselves here for dinner
the service is great
they put our napkins on our laps and brought us the warm towel after dinner
our water was never left unfilled
and they even chased me down with my coat once
i love the food
its so good it's hard to stop_eating it
my boyfriend loves meat and i am a vegetarian
we both were pleased here and that can be hard to accomplish
we were always welcomed and fed well at a reasonable_price
if you are near odana and hungry
try it out
fantastic food
really excellent
my only suggestion for the restaurant
please serve red_wine in red_wine glasses
otherwise a star
fantastic food
really excellent
my only suggestion for the restaurant
please serve red_wine in red_wine glasses
otherwise a star
im not indian
but i've tried really good indian food and this place is pretty good
i always get the the two dishes that can never go wrong which is the chicken_tikka_masala and the tandoori_chicken
sorry if i spelled that incorrectly
anyways this place also has really good rice
its actually flavored
overall my favorite place to eat in madison so far
i love_this_place
nice and very friendly_staff
my sister is a regular
and i would be if i lived on_the_west_side
if you're craving indian and do not know what to order
the lunch buffet is where it's at
i'm one of those picky types
where decisions are difficult for me
so a buffet is perfect
plus
if you're not familiar_with_indian_food
then it would no fun if you chose something from the menu and ended_up not liking it
and this place crushes all stereotypes of a buffet
it always is clean
the food is always fresh
no crunchy rice
and they serve a wonderful variety_of_dishes
chicken masala is my favorite with the vegetable fritters
and they always bring the naan out right away
and it's so warm
mmm
just what you need on a cold day
cheap too
i always leave stuffed and ready for a nap
love the lunch buffet
i probably go once a week
but the dinners are great too
and you definitely get a lot of food with each order
the restaurant is never very crowded
and once you get to know the waiters
they are extremely generous
and love to see familiar faces
love_this_place
great buffet for a very reasonable_price
i wish i could go more often
don't let the empty parking_lot and smallish looking restaurant fool you this is some of the best indian_fare
and dining_experience
you'll find in madison
i'll admit
seeing the place from the outside didn't have me convinced
but since when did i start going to restaurants for their outdoor decor
the night of us went for dinner
the place was empty
not another soul there
the staff_was_very_friendly and accommodating right off the bat
getting us situated with a table and bread before we had a chance to take our coats off
i love free stuff
at one point during the evening
we had separate folks waiting our table
talk about service
all very friendly
trying to be helpful and clear things quickly
i didn't order a drink like my other two compadres
but the staff brought out chai for me
without asking
on the house
it was phenomenal
and free
they had me at
on the house
down to the food everything was incredibly flavorful
our table had chicken dishes
curry
veg dish
and sides of nan
the chicken was done perfectly and melted in_your_mouth
portions are plenty big
we ate more than we should
in short
these_guys know what they're doing
go
i wanna gonna give stars because the food was excellent but the service was terrible
so minus one star for that
the place was crowded and they didn't have enough waiters
when i asked the waiter to take a photo of me with the food
he said ok and never came back
when i asked for the bill
the waiter forgot
i ordered wine and they never brought it
i had to remind them that i had ordered wine
the food
however
was excellent
the daal was very tasty
and the chicken_tikka makni was amazing
the mixed tandoori platter seemed really popular
i saw many people order plate after plate of meat on a sizzling hot plate
so i ordered it too and it was so tender
you get chicken
shrimp and beef
bottomline
come here when it is not crowded
i love the indian buffet
only on weekends and it cost bucks
so very reasonably_priced
tandoori_chicken and naan is very good
i still love the food here
but frankly we most often eat at the east_side location
i recently had a http
restaurant
com certificate for this location
though
so we made the trek over
i was not pleased with the way my certificate was handled they shorted the credit by a few dollars
and when challenged
had some goofy excuse
not sure how
but three reasonable adults still racked up a bill over before tip and after a coupon
i also didn't like that the gin and tonic i ordered was each for rail gin
wow this place is amazing
i seriously could not stop_eating
buffet variety is excellent
taste is average by indian food stds
good
authentic_indian_food
thanks yelp for helping us find it
i've only had indian food on a few occasions
and most of it was either homemade by friends or limited to appetizers
i was excited_to_try maharaja because i had heard good things and it would be a new experience
they for sure do not disappoint
we walked in to a quiet restaurant with only a few patrons for a late dinner
and were greeted_by polite hosts
servers
etc
upon seating us
they pulled the chair out for my fiance and set her napkin which i thought was a nice_touch
we mentioned to the server that it was our first time there and asked for some recommendations and he was very responsive
he suggested an appetizer
the samosa
which was absolutely_delicious
he also recommended that for our meals we try the mixed_grill and the tikki_masala chicken with garlic_nan bread
and to throw a little sweet into the mix with a mango milkshake smoothy
we did all of the above and it was fantastic
other waiters were prompt on getting us water
and there was only about minutes between the appetizers and the meal which was a good amount of time to let things settle
we also had some bread crisps with three different kinds of chutney to sample while we waited
overall
one of the best experiences i've had in madison at a restaurant
i highly_recommend
i'm going back soon to try their_lunch_buffet as it looks like the same food albeit at a more affordable price
dinner entrees are normally in the range
we wanted to try a new indian restaurant and found this place near west towne mall via yelp
service was exceptional
i've been in the restaurant business for over years and they went above and beyond what i expected for a small family_owned business
we came in around pm on a monday night and upon seating our party of
the server set our napkins for us and made_us_feel welcomed
the restaurant wasn't too busy that evening so my rating may be skewed because of that
i didn't give them a full stars because they were always there at the table or near by
i would suggest to them to be able to
read
the table better and adjust their services accordingly
but i definitely give them credit for being courteous and anticipating our needs
like asking if we'd like more rice
food was delicious
spices were just right without being too spicy
the chutney's served in the beginning of our meal were tasty as well
we ordered the lamb_rogan_josh
lamb masala
and chicken_vindaloo
the meats were very tender and the curries were tasting light
we also ordered chapati and the plain_naan which were amazing
this was the best naan i've ever had
texture was light and airy
so soft it melted in_your_mouth
we had mango lassi's to drink and complimented the spicy notes in our food
the lassi was not too sweet and perfectly tangy
pleasantly
at the end of our meal they brought out clean hot towels for us to refresh our hands with
we had leftovers and to my surprise the next day
the server had put a scoop of rice in the container for us to enjoy with our leftover curry
we_will_definitely_be_back
thanks to yelp we found a great indian restaurant just minutes from our hotel
we were in town for the great taste of the midwest and needed some food after several hours of beer drinking
this place filled the bill
we started with the best samosas i have had large and crispy with a very flavorful filling
all of us really enjoyed our main_courses
i had a lamb dish with tomatoes and mushrooms
husband had chicken_tikki_masala and daughter had paneer
i liked that they cooked the food to your spice_level
we also had excellent naan
garlic flavor was the best
and basamati rice
service was excellent and very prompt
we enjoy several indian places in the chicago area
and this was as good if not better
we have never had a bad meal here
we recently ordered some carry_out and it was superb
we ordered two different chicken curry dishes
the prices are a bit high but we are more than happy to spend more for good quality and maharaja delivers
the mango_ice_cream is delicious
the service was quick and very friendly showing interest in what we were doing the day we stopped by
the atmosphere is pleasant and the background music very nice
all the previous reviews are spot on
we loved this restaurant
best indian food we've had in years
we had cheese pakora
mulligatawny soup
chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori_chicken and aloo_gobi
it was all delicious
but the tandoori_chicken was the best
and naan
can't forget that
would definitely come here again
friendly_staff
we mentioned we were passing through and he said he knew we were newcomers
the others in the restaurant were regulars
some of whom were indian
which is always a good sign
stop here for good food
this place is great
i was looking for a great place for dinner with the bf and found this place
we ended_up going there for the lunch buffet
when you first walk in
the place looks a little on the fancier side and i had jeans and t shirt on so i sort of felt a little under dressed
after looking around though it was more that they just had nice decor because everyone_else seemed really casual too
their_lunch_buffet is
and completly worth it
everything that i had was so good and flavorful
they also had so many different varieties
i had the mango drink which tasted like a fresh squeezed mango
fresh
for dessert i went with mango again and had the mango_ice_cream
cold
that was good too
all in all i highly_recommend this place
it was the only meal me and the man ate that day but it kept us full the entire day
ooooh and the naan is included in the buffet too
not only is the food great
but the staff always treats us like royalty
i go in with my three young kids
by myself or to meet friends for lunch
we are always greeted like old friends
my kids love the chicken_tiki_masala
vegetable balls and mulligatawny soup all mild
i love the aloo gobhi and their lovely fried cauliflower in the sweet red sauce
among many other things
their chai is warming and good just_the_right_amount_of sweetness and spice
very family friendly
the lunch buffet has a great variety of food
wow
this place made me love indian food
i had three entrees with my husband and all were good
i can't wait to go for the lunch buffet to try different things
the staff was friendly and the place was clean and well pressed
this is one of those mediocre indian_restaurants that reek of complacency in just about everything they serve
i feel sorry for residents of madison because there isn't a single good indian restaurant in this city so they obviously don't know what they are missing out on
fortunately hours away in the city of chicago you have the best indian_restaurants in the country and cheap too
thank god for that
the meat here isn't the best quality and definitely not fresh
its frozen chicken
the biryani is a joke and more like a pulao
service is slow but what will shock you the most are the prices
wayyy overpriced for the mediocrity they dish out
any indian restaurant worth its salt that serves classic non vegetarian food will not have south_indian_cuisine on the same menu
that to me was a dead giveaway that food here was not going to be good and was i right
after dinner they were thoughtful to serve hot towelettes to wipe our hands with but one whiff and you could literally smell the dirty water they were washed in
absolutely terrible experience
will not go here again
they are so great
the staff is super friendly at both the east and west side locations
the lunch buffet for
amazing
the west side location is cuter
more niche
but i am a fan of both
the food is amazing
definitely get the bang for your buck
will_definitely_be_back
time and time again
went here for the first time while visiting a friend
and i must say this place is pretty good
i'm a fan_of_indian_food by far
and this place rocked
the only gripe i had was that they had a batch of basmati_rice on the buffet for a while and when i put it on the plate it was too crunchy
i told them about it
and thy immediately put out another pot of rice which was fresh
the mango_ice_cream was out_of_this_world
i like this place
and would return
i absolutely love_this_place
the staff is friendly and the food is delicious
the buffets are great and so is any food you order_off_the_menu
i have never had a bad meal here before
every time we are in madison
we stop by and have lunch or dinner or take an order out
we are seriously going to miss maharaja's now that we've moved to south florida
no indian food lives up to this place
i've had better indian food once or twice but it has always been in bigger cities and has been much more expensive
the food is great and i highly_recommend the buffet
i have never found an indian place that match the quality at this value
fantastic
you gotta go for the buffet so you can try a little bit of everything
the paneer is the best
the staff is super_nice too
my second indian food experience
and it was not had the lunch buffet
good food
good price
you walk into the restaurant and the buffet looks really delicious with an overwhelming variety
the highlights were the mango_ice_cream
grilled fish
vegetable_pakora and the homemade chutneys
the service was very friendly_and_attentive
the food is all way too mild
there should be
at least
one dish in an indian restaurant that threatens to burn your face off
the dishes all look good but they left me very unsatisfied
in addition
all of the dishes seemed to be off temperature
it wasn't bad
but i am not ovewhelmed
the chicken_tika_masala was tough
the sauce was not thick enough and was
as i mentioned earlier
way too mild
i have a hunch
had i ordered off of the menu
the food would have been much better
the bread was more like pita and less like naan and that's a shame because the bread is very important to me
for an indian meal
there was a cabbage dish that verged on being fantastic
i probably will not have a sunday_afternoon craving for this place
in the end
i found a few items that i liked
and i would probably give them another shot
this is my first less than stellar review on yelp
but the last time i went here
nobody was satisfied
we have been before for the buffet
which if i remember well was pretty decent
so we went for dinner when my parents and brother visited me in madison
i don't remember exactly what i got
but it was a vegan dish with peas as a star
what i do remember is how very bland it tasted
i'm no expert
but i'm also no stranger to indian food
the spicy tomato y sauce that is a base part of many dishes was water y and lacked flavor
i even ordered it
medium
my family all had similar complaints
though they all tasted mine and agreed that it was the worst of the four
i t was very unfortunate because i love indian food
and i love peas
and i have generally liked the two in madison
but this fell very short
i have eaten in indian places all over the country and this place ranks up there with one of the worst
the wait_staff is nice
the water stayed full
but the food is dead avg at best
one of the reasons i love indian food is the depth of flavor
last_night i had to salt the lamb dish b c it was so flat
we have left_overs which is usually a hot commodity for lunch_the_next_day
neither one of us have touched them
i've just moved to madison and this is my first time here
but i don't envision returning anytime soon
for madison
for chicago
so either way it's about as_good_as_it_gets for indian food here
we first went to the one in milwaukee
then moved here
and found out the place in milwaukee
which we thought was awesome
had more here
yay
so we've eaten here a bunch of times
usually carry_out
nice portions
the price isn't too bad for indian
which from my experience tends to be high priced
low portions compared_to_other cuisine
we love the tandoori_chicken
the curry_sauce which comes with it
good basmati as well
hard to make that bad
we love the veggie appetizer plate
which includes samosa which is very good
and others
we like all of them
probably the least favorite is the cheese thing
pakora is great
we love the breads
we order on the side
stuffed naans
prathas
etc
all in all great indian food for anywhere
still could find better in a larger city like chicago
nyc
or la
but this is bumble f
wi
so be happy there is some decent indian food
p
s
also ate the buffet lunch one time
and it was a very good value
plus you get to try a whole bunch of different things you might not normally get to have
i suggest going at some point
i ordered through
straight your door
when staying at a hotel in middleton
wi
i had the chicken_biryani and it was delicious
more chicken than in any other biryani i have had
and i have eaten in many indian_restaurants across the country
i would definitely order from here again
best goat i've ever had
ok
yes this is the first time i've had goat
but i have had a lot of indian food before and this was so good
i absolutely had to order the cheese nan for an appetizer
it arrived in about minutes after ordering
which was fine since i nommed on some of the crackers with cilantro mint relish while i waited
the nan came with four pieces with a mild cheese on tip
which was absolutely scrumdilliumptious
for my entree i wanted to go a little crazy
so i ordered the goat malabar
i was a little frightened
never eaten goat before
but i was super surprised and excited that it was tender
flavorful and totally awesome
i ordered it mild and it packed quite a punch
i love that you can order different spiciness levels
super plus
they have a great selection of indian beer too which was fun to try
i ordered the flying horse
which was a light and refreshing ale that cut the heat of the spicy dishes
the gentlemen working were very polite
they pulled out my chair and placed a napkin in my lap
i felt_like an indian princess
the only con was that the decor was a bit dated
with a 's feel
the carpet was old and dingy and they had fake flowers on the tables which were rapidly collecting dust
not romantic
however
the wait_staff was always willing to come and fill up water and ask us how we were doing
it felt nice to be taken_care_of
i'll definitely come again and order something else adventurous
excellent chicken_vindaloo
great tea
nice service
beautiful presentation
good place
very reasonable
best indian in madison
this is my happy place
the dining_room is always filled with other happy madisonians mowing on indian
maharaja do it
and be sure to order the masala tea
the lunch buffet is great for a group or just a couple
the food is wonderful and consistent
if you always wanted to try indian food but are afraid you'll order something and not like it
fear no more
the buffet is a wonderful way to try a myriad of representatives of this fine international cuisine
this is a favorite of my family and my coworkers
and i work with a large number of indian citizens
best indian in madison
i've been coming here for the past couple years the food is superb and only surpassed by the service
on just my second visit
the manager recognized me and took the effort to have a conversation
learn my name
etc
he's friendly every time i come in
treats me like a regular even if i haven't been around in a couple months
he truly makes sure we have a great dining_experience and it's not just me
all customers seem to get similar treatment
the food itself
i could go on forever just try it yourself
my favorites are the lamb_vindaloo
madras
goat malabar
chicken saag
you can't_go_wrong
oh and the weekend buffets are a great way to try a bunch of delicious things too
delicious
we ordered dinner take out
the tikka masala and aloo ghobi
both of which were fantastic
naan delicious as well
priced the same as all the other indian around
will_be_going_back
incredible
seriously
i live in an area with a large indian population
and with really great places to eat
i went to this restaurant while in madison on business
i was floored
everything from the papadam and chutneys to the masala tea at the end was delicious
i had the lamb_vindaloo
hot
the gravy was thick and spicy
and the lamb was tender
naan was perfect
for desert masala tea and gulab_jamun
both were outstanding
service was attentive
friendly
and we were provided with scented hot cloths to clean after eating
my only wish was that they served their dishes thali
but i left so stuffed that i really didn't need it
if you are in madison and like indian food you must give them your business
you_will_not_be_disappointed
the beginning of brought many resolutions my way
all of which i have kept thus far
thank you very much
one of those said resolutions was to try indian food
wow
have i been missing out
i am a fan of heat and spice
i find myself trying to find the next hotter sauce spice
while i am not sure what it was
i think i found it
i found my breaking point in hot sauces
that alone will bring me back somewhere
having gone on a friday with a group of woman from work
i really had no_idea_what i was getting myself into for the lunch buffet
but i decided
heck
i'll try it
worst case scenario i am out
plus
i figured i had the chance to just try small bites of something i have never had before
everything was warm hot and nothing was sitting out for too long
i wish i could tell you everything i ate
but the two things that really stood_out for me were the tikka masala and the sausage made with lamb
which should really say a lot coming from someone who is a faux vegetarian
the only thing that brings down my rating is the decor
i felt_like i was walking into a 's banquet hall
besides that
the staff was incredibly kind and helpful
especially when i started to cry from whatever spoonful of hot_sauce i foolishly poured down my throat
will i be back
you betcha
will i eat whatever magical sauce i ate that day
darn right
will i get the buffet
no
because i like myself and like to be able to breathe after i am done eating
better than swagat on old sauk for sure
and possibly better than taste_of_india on monroe
we came here for a late lunch buffet on a sunday
and we practically had the place to ourselves
there was a huge variety of foods on the buffet
with about a split of meaty vs
vegetarian_options
most of the items weren't super spicy
which i'm sure they have to do on the buffet to meet most people's preferences
they bring naan to your table
and it is excellent
tender yet chewy
and slightly buttery
yum
also
don't miss the mango_ice_cream
it is incredibly delicious and refreshing
this is fabulous food
and the service is wonderful
woe is me
what took me so long to discover this place
and to think
all the times that i've craved indian food
maharaja was just a short drive away
my friend and i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
mild
the fish_curry
medium
and the regular naan
our entrees came with a side of rice and a complementary flatbread appetizer served with tamarind_sauce and two types of chutney
onion and cilantro
while the portions are small
the food is very filling probably on account of all the carbs
p
as for our dishes
the chicken was a little tough
but otherwise well seasoned
i really enjoyed the creamy tomato base
and i was glad that i ordered it mild instead of medium because the medium fish_curry was really spicy
i was a huge_fan_of the battered catfish cooked in a garlic ginger sauce
but i could only take so much heat
service was impeccable
our_water_glasses were always filled quickly and plates were cleared off the table as soon as we were done with them
the staff continually circulated by to see how we were enjoying the meal and seemed genuinely interested in any feedback we had about our dining_experience
just an fyi
the online menu is a little outdated
i wanted to order the chana_masala but it wasn't an option on the restaurant menu
fortunately
you really can't_go_wrong with any of the curries or masalas
give 'em a try
if the important things about buffets are the quality and variety of food stuffs
this place definitely has the latter
i couldn't help but try nearly everything
plates and dessert bowls later
i successfully gathered my parts together in time to write this review before falling into a very long nap
there was an appetizer table with fried goodies
chicken cooked at least different ways
delicious veggie_options
a soup bar
and a dessert table
probably different chutneys
i cried with delight when i spotted the idli and coconut_chutney
and dosai with sambar
seeing as those are some of my favorite indian food items
it was hard to hold back
late sunday after noon
customers were still filing in on the regular
a wide range of people were dining here
from couples to families to large groups of students
it seems like they have plenty of regulars and a very diverse crowd at that
m f
for the lunch buffet
and sat sun will set you back
laterzzzzzzz
i would not recommend this restaurant to anyone for one reason
pathetic customer_service
they really don't care about their customers as they know they are one of the very few indian restaurants_in_madison
food is very ordinary and they cheat on their timings
they mention they are open till
but stop taking people and orders by
let them rather put they are open only until
they need to learn proper business etiquette
people come for food and they just turn them down without any kind of considerations
i hope we get better restaurant in madison and we avoid going there
the best goat_curry and kulfi
yum yum_yum
i was in town for business and i used yelp to find a good indian restuarant
i enjoyed this place and if i find myself in madison again
i would_definitely_go_back
the atmosphere
sort of dark in the restaurant but it was well maintained and had a typical
indian restaurant
type decor
there was indian music_playing but it was not too loud
the service
the service was very attentive
my_water_glass did not go empty
my food arrived very quickly
almost too quickly as i had just been served the crackers with sauces chutneys
several different waiters were working together to ensure that everything a diner could want was there
the food
very good
i ordered the lamb_vindaloo and asked for it
hot
often when i go to indian_restaurants and say
hot
they actually serve it sort of medium
this was pretty hot and my nose was running a bit and i drank a lot of ice water as well
i also ordered a naan
with pistachios and raisins
and a mango_lassi to drink
i thought it was all quite good
the only thing wrong was that some of the rice was a bit tough and hard
i'm sure they would have brought me more rice but i just picked around it
the amount of food was plentiful and i could only eat about half
when i was finished with my meal the water brought me a small dish of mango_ice_cream
it was a little icy but i thought it was a nice end to the meal
i think you would be hard pressed to find a better indian restaurant in madison
in fact some of the best_indian_food_i_have_ever had
the service was great and the atmosphere was a bit dark but cozy
maharaja is a great indian buffet restaurant
you can try anything or everything
quality is good
no waiting
the atmosphere is very utilitarian but friendly
a great place to take hungry college students who want some authentic ethnic food
the best indian food and wait service i've ever had
from the complimentary papadums to the after dinner hot towel
classy and very reasonably_priced
two nan orders
two entrees
for less than
delicious
ok indian buffet
you are brought fresh naan
ask for more fresh
don't bother with the soggy naan at the buffet
potatoes were hard
but lots of chutneys and chicken dishes
the carrot_halwa was not so good
its better elsewhere
my husband i used to love_this_place until we had takeout one night found a dead roach the bottom of his briyani can't eat there again
one of the worse indian food i have ever tried
i ordered lamb josh and the lamb was not well cooked and lamb_biryani was also a big failure
who the hell puts water chestnut in lamb_biryani
the taste was also terrible
will_never_go_back
was here twice in the last couple months
once for a lunchtime buffet
which was spectacular
and most recently for a quiet dinner for two
i would give this place five_stars if it weren't for the quirky service
as is the case with most establishments in madison i've noticed lately
the service is often mediocre
inconsistent
or just downright bad
unfortunately
in this instance
maharaja was no exception
my dining partner and i were promptly greeted_by a waiter at our table
being that the menu is quite extensive and wanting plenty of time to pour over it
i indicated my indecision and told our server that we weren't in any rush
he must've taken that to mean to disappear for the next minutes
during that time
my companion and i decided on an appetizer and i had some questions
feeling like we were stranded on an island
i closed my menu a couple times as a lifeline signal
that didn't work
frustrated
we finally flagged someone over
i was irritated that i could've spent all those wasted minutes noshing while pondering my meal selection
after a bit of a communication issue over the menu
we each put in our individual dinner orders
my companion relayed the drink choice
chardonnay
plus a coke for him
seeming confused
the waiter attempted to clarify
i interjected with a chuckle
well
not in the same glass of course
referring to the soda and wine
moments later
the waiter returned with a wine for me and what appeared_to_be a watery coke for him
it was obvious after the first sip
the chardonnay and coke were indeed combined
ummmm
did this just happen
again our server remained mia
finally he returned with my companion's entree
but not mine
about a third of the way into his meal
my dinner finally arrived
sorry
but that is just not acceptable
there was no apology and no indication of the extended wait time
our service throughout the meal was spotty
with intervals of more frequent attention and drink refills
it is important to note that we showed_up just as they opened at pm so the restaurant was not busy at all until a bit later into our meal
the food was very good
and mine was nice and spicy as i had requested
perhaps this was just a fluke
but hopefully next time the quality of food will match the level of service
so i want to like maharaja but i have a hard time doing it
i live very close to the restaurant and it always smells delicious from the outside
plus
how can you beat a well priced lunch buffet
however
i love indian food and have had some terrific foods in other states and this just doesn't stack up
their naan isn't quite fluffy enough
not sure they cook it in a tandoori
and their food is a little too one note and a bit on the heavy side
i went to this restaurant on a friends recommendation
woo hoo i was pretty surprised with the experience
i'm from bay_area and have been to many indian_restaurants
on my recent visit to madison
wi i've been to maharaja restaurant
i ordered for malai_kofta and aloo parathas that also came with a bowl of rice and a free desert
carrot_halwa
i ordered it over the phone and went to pick_up the food after an_hour
the staff were really friendly and have to mention the potions were more than usually i get for one order in bay_area
malai_kofta was spicy and well made to my taste and i liked the rest of the food ordered that day
over all its a very good eating joint
good service
nice food and it was worth for what i paid for
i will recommend_this_place to my friends
i had punjabi saag and shahi_paneer and both were delicious
i've eaten at indian_restaurants around the world and this is up there with the best that i've experienced
staff very friendly_and_attentive
right next_door to an indian grocery so i expected something really tasty and that's what we got
i'll keep it simple
you are missing out if you don't try this place
it has the best indian food with amazing service
all i can say is the next time you want to grab food
come here and you will leave happy and stuffed
we cannot wait_to_go_back
overall a good place
a lot of selections and even had ice_cream and a good amount of dessert
curry was a bit watered_down
but still edible
had the lunch buffet
was probably the most worth it
good service
tandoori_chicken was delicious with a little bit of kick
the sauce that came with it wasn't impressive but not bad
the lamb_biryani was very tasty moist and flavorful
do not hesitate
this is where you want to eat lunch
just go there
trust_me
i am an indian food fanatic
and this place is one of my favorite restaurants of all time
we were just visiting madison for the weekend
but maharaja lunch buffet is one of the many reasons i will_be_returning to this great city
at first i was disappointed that the buffet did not feature saag_paneer
my favorite
but let_me_tell_you
everything was amazing
i am kind of glad there was no saag_paneer because i ended_up trying a lot of dishes i had not tried before
there was not one single thing that was not delicious
everything was spiced perfectly
just_the_right_amount_of kick
there was a desert soup coconut pistachio that was amazing
as a vegetarian
and a lover of scrumptious foods
this place was a delight
it is about minutes from downtown if i remember correctly
nice restaurant
with very attentive staff
service_was_prompt and courteous
rather large menu
with something for everyone
i has the paneer masala_dosa
which came with there sauces
coconut
a cold tomato based one and a spicy bean
the portion was huge and delicious
i will_definitely_be_back
great food and great place
we had the calamari as appetizer and the non veggie combination for two people
that's a lot of food
i think that was enough for three people
service was fantastic
maharaja was one of the first restaurants i came to when i first moved to madison from long beach artesia ca
where some of the best indian_restaurants in the country are
and maharaja shot up to the top of my list
wonderful buffet
predictably good
wonderful wait_staff
i highly_recommend maharaja
absolutely_delicious
great service
there just aren't words in our vocabulary to describe how stellar the service is as well as the quality of the food
if you go in for the lunch buffet you get the best value for your money
we find that dinner tends to get on the pricey side
but the service makes you feel like a king and or queen
the servers stay on top of your drink situation and do everything they can to make you comfortable
if you catch them at a slower time of the day
they will actually bring you a hot towel after your meal
we love_this_place and recommend it to all of our friends
yum yum_yum
great lunch buffet with many choices and flavors
great for larger groups with ample space
service very friendly
ordered kadhai paneer naan
the paneer was extremely hard did not taste authentic
have had beter
best service i have had in years
incredibly attentive
but not too much so
friendly
warm and helpful
for those of you who are interested in help navigating a new menu
i observed the owner
providing really nice assistance to the adventurous and or timid afraid of what to order
i learned a few things
and i've been eating indian for decades
i would suggest ordering a bit more spicy hot than you typically go
as the food was a bit on the mild side something i have noticed more in madison
food was delicious
particularly the shahi_paneer
staff could not have been more than welcoming and patient with my young daughter
while she is very laid back and good when dining out
we are often met with initial curtness
not this time
i cannot over stress the extraordinary service enough
while i do not expect staff to fawn over me
the attentiveness greatly enhanced the experience and made me feel like the occasion
and i
was something extra special
i often bring my wife and daughter here for the lunch buffet
the reason i only come to the buffet is that my daughter and i can experiment with mixing the different sauces and trying new things since we're not very well versed in indian_cuisine
i don't know nor care whether they are authentic because everything they have is pleasing to my palate
wife really loves the saag
service is always prompt
cave creek is such a cute little town and everytime i go to az i stop by the town it is so old west
we were wandering through and were hungry and saw a sign for indian fry_bread
yummy
so basically you go in through the souvenier shop and walk through a little alley kitchen and there is a small dining_room tables or so nothing fancy
i was very much like mexican food with the beans ect
the bread was really good and the owner was so so friendly love it
i love_this_place
it's inside an american indian souvenier shop
just go to the back place your order and sit in their little eating area
everyone their is friendly and the navajo frybread is absolutely_delicious
it's huge and hard to finish
prices_are_very_reasonable
really fresh mexican food
good prices and owner is very friendly
he'll fire burrito is great
i'm from chicago but i have traveled to arizona many many times
i discovered_this_place on my first trip and now every time i vacation to arizona i make sure i go to indian village multiple_times
i love their tacos and the crunchy shell is amazing and they taste so fresh
i also like their enchiladas
the place is a dive but i often find those are the best places
the service is friendly
bart
the owner
is wacky but he keeps you entertained while you wait for your food
i usually browse in the shop attached to the restaurant
i can't wait for my next arizona vacation so i can go to indian village again
my friend and i were swayed by other reviews to try this restaurant
expecting a gem in the rough a treasure an amazing find
we didn't find it here
in clarification
it didn't taste bad
it was just nothing special
i've made better at home just by trying
the most flavorful part of the meal was the hot_sauce on the table
essential
and not just because i like a little spice
and i do mean a little
but because i prefer flavor to my food especially when i have a choice
the reason i didn't give just one star is because it seemed clean and had a cool
hole_in_the_wall
mom pop feel
there was no
service
to speak of it's a
we'll cook it and you pick_it_up at the window
environment
totally fine
if the food is good
the people were very nice
but there are just so many other places to try that unless the experience is craving worthy
i'm moving along
no harm no foul
just no looking back
if you don't try the navajo taco you'll never know what you missed
i'm not a lover of mexican food
but i've never had a lunch i didn't like at indian village
when volunteering for the local chamber of commerce
i always recommended this place and several folks came back to thank me for a memorable meal at a very inexpensive price
don't let the lack of ambiance fool you
the food is the reason this place is great
this is a great mom_and_pop shop with great food
i read some of the other reviews and the ones that gave it low stars are ridiculous
they were expecting something that is clearly not how this shop operates
also
i think someone reviewed their ribs
which they do not have there and clearly mistook the indian village for the horny toad which is next_door
but
if you want good tacos
good people and a good environment
check_this_place_out
the owner is particularly hysterical
i love_this_place
who eats a hot dog in fry_bread
you will if you go to indian village
great tacos
fry_bread and burritos
stop at the circle k next_door and get a sixy of your favorites to enjoy with the best mexican food in cave creek
it's cool because it's a big time dive
the food is ok
the shells are deep_fried
but the guts are very boring
overall it's ok and the prices are ok
it's worth going once
twice max
hoping for a unique arizona experience
we stopped in to indian village
carefree for lunch
at for tacos for three people
it wasn't at all the
little local joint
atmosphere we were expecting
staff was straight faced
minus any warm and fuzzy
food
albeit just standard fare
came out quickly
seven tables inside the dining_area needed attention and there was no temperature control
it was freezing cold inside
there was an outdoor patio with additional tables but we probably won't go back to see if it was any cleaner
such a good place
my parents know the owner bart personally and he is always really friendly talkative and always has a smile on his face
kind of hidden from more of the desert ridge area and kierland but it definitely is worth_the_drive if you live far
fry_bread
tacos
and burritos are definitely the best here
super cheap which is better
employees are always working hard and smiling so thats a plus
food comes out very fast and theres seating out and inside
there is a bathroom which doesnt look like there is one but there is and thats a good thing for a carefree restaurant
meh
chimichanga seemed like it was a pre made
kinda boring
i had something a bit more authentic
decent
bit nothing special
the chips are just like mission out of a bag from costco
like another reviewer mentioned
there are way too many other places in cave creek to try
you can grab some of this awesome mexican food and walk across the parking_lot and have a beer at the hideaway bar everyone is cool
you will be put off by the look of the indian village but it is great
if you go to the hideaway they have menus and will be happy to call your order
it's a win win
give it a try
we were wanting a small dive with authentic
good mexican food
and that's exactly what we got
food tasted great
chicken tacos were good and my husband loved the tamales
the fry_bread with honey and sugar was so yummy
if you're wanting a small mom_and_pop joint
this is your place
i thought by going to the indian village i would get some great food
i have gotten their fry_bread before and it was pretty tasty so i thought i would try something else
i went there with my friend
i got chicken tacos and frybread with powdered sugar and honey and he got a vegetable
egg and cheese breakfast burrito
when we got the food it looked really appetizing
when we started to eat it was a different story
the food was very bland
very bland
the chicken tacos had no seasoning or anything
the plate came with a side of salsa so i tried to use that to kick off the flavor
didn't work
with no tabasco or any other hot_sauce i decided to just tough it out and finish my plate
my friends breakfast burrito was not impressive either
he had the same complaint of blandness
the fry_bread was the only thing that was good
it was very inexpensive so i'm not too upset
both of our meals plus fry_bread and drinks were
but as a college student i would have liked to save the money or cooked something at home
i told my parents about the experience and they said it was hit_or_miss
so if you feel like taking a food gamble go to the indian village
also the service was at par
nothing great but nothing awful
spinach enchilada was outstanding
tacos crisp
perfect
quesadilla with shredded chicken
cheese vanished from our plates
rice and beans perfect sides
we thought we ordered to much
nothing was left
this was authentic and well prepared
five thumbs_up
this place is worth stars at most
bland no flavor fry_bread tacos
the fry_bread was too doughy and soft and thick for me
i like my fry_bread more airy and a little more crispy
the beans were dry and the cheese wasn't even melted
the staff was very nice
the atmosphere is very cool
bikers everywhere
it's next_door to a biker bar
i love that it's a hole_in_the_wall kind of place which usually has the best food
i'd probably try it again after a few drinks next_door
food always taste better then
maybe that's why all the high reviews
every year we visit phx and head up to cave creek to visit bart and eat some fry_bread
always delicious
always character
always an experience
love this little place
the food here is simply amazing
when i walked in
i did not know what to expect
but
my friend assured me that this place was the real deal
i had the spinach enchiladas and they were made with perfection
this place is exactly how i like my mexican food
we sat outside on some benches which had a real cool southwestern feel
which was wonderful since i am not from the area
can't_wait_to_try this place again
vegas is the land of the strip_mall
seriously
outside of downtown
they're everywhere
and wedged in between all the nail salons and paycheck advance stores
you can find some pretty good restaurants
if you don't mind the less than breathtaking surroundings
gandhi is a solid
reliable indian restaurant that we've been going to for years
the building is mysteriously huge
with super high ceilings and a dining_area that goes on for miles
but it does fill up at peak times on the weekends
the decor is nothing fancy bare white walls livened up with some wall hangings or framed pictures but you're not there for the ambience
you're there for tons of spicy food
when you sit_down
they'll plop some pappadom down in front of you
those crunchy cracker like flatbreads
plus a mint cilantro sauce and a sweet and sour sauce
i love this stuff
but be judicious in your use of the spicy sauce
because water service can be a bit slow here
everything here is good
especially the garlic_naan
the tandoori_chicken is yummy
as is the rogan_josh
palak_paneer
and tikka masala
entrees range from
although they also have special tasting menus
including salad
rice
and dessert
that range from
they have a lunch buffet on weekdays that's also an excellent value
and there's a pretty good selection of beer_and_wine
including a few indian beers
to go with your meal
nothing fancy decor or ambience wise
gandhi nevertheless delivers good and reasonably_priced indian food in a quiet and pleasant setting
if vegas isn't already hot enough for you
spice it up with a trip to gandhi
and get the garlic_naan
desperate for some indian food
we were referred to gandhi's india's_cuisine
we arrived at
pm
only to discover they don't open for dinner on a saturday until pm
as we debated whether it was worth waiting for
a couple of guys pulled up next to us and raved_about place
saying
it's really good
it's hella good
so
hearing this
we had to come back at pm and so we did
what a mistake
as we piled in at
pm
we looked around at the customers already seated
lots of indians were already dining and we took this as a good sign
and then we saw the buffet table set up
hmmm
we were hoping for an a la_carte menu
unfortunately
they only had the buffet option available and so we were stuck with that
we ordered mango_lassi to drink and that was a highlight
then we all loaded up for the buffet line
gandhi's offers a mix of north and south_indian cuisines and i was disappointed with pretty much everything available
i usually want indian food when i desire lots of rich spices and tastes going on
and all th dishes simmering away lacked any full or individual flavors
there was no spice
no heat
nothing that stood_out
blah
they offered mint cilantro sauce
but no pappadoms
argh
i love pappadoms and they didn't have any
i was already disappointed
i love naan_bread in general
but usually try the garlic or onion kinds
or whatever else is offered
not at this place
they just had plain naan_bread that lacked any real flavor
everything had potatoes in it
too much potatoes if any
one of my dining companions felt that she didn't eat her money's worth and went back for dessert the mango condensed milk dessert with fruit cocktail
we all agreed that was the only thing worth eating there
how sad is that
sure
i ate
i was hungry
it wasn't particularly good indian food
it was just that
food
and nothing else
this restaurant was noted as award winning and
best ethnic restaurant in las_vegas
at one point
i would assume they were a pretty decent indian restaurant some time ago
but no longer
i guess it's a sign when an indian restaurant starts out with an a la_carte menu
then ditches it completely to go for the buffet thing
it means hard times
they are strapped and desperate for business
too bad i won't be that desperate enough to come here again unless i'm dragged
yeah
for the price of less than pp
you get more bang for your buck this way
but that's not why i came to gandhi's to eat
i can't believe this place had a banner outside calling it the
best ethnic restaurant of las_vegas
i don't remember what year or what company judged this place
obviously the judges might have ate at this establishment years_ago
or the judges had been starving
for days
so that anything tastes delicious
prior to eating here
my party was suggested by other frequent patrons that this place was
hella good
i was very disappointed because as i walked in i noticed the buffet line
we were told that a la_carte items were not offered
so that means the buffet food has been sitting out or possibly left_overs from yesterday
the tandoori_chicken was so dry and unflavorful
the lamb was full of flavor from all the spices but was just too tough
a lot of the vegatable dishes had more cauliflower than expected
filler
so a lot of farting
ooh
and that shredded carrot dessert
yech
the only yummy thing was the tangy mango_lassi
im not sure if one of the dishes i had was palak_paneer
if it was
it didnt taste like what ive had before
the decor of this place was so dated
it was white walled with a high ceiling with a huge rug above you
it was also very chilly inside
the buffet line took away the appeal and decor of the place
im assuming they went buffet style b c of the lack of business
it is a hard find with morton's and buca di beppo right smack in front of you
i really do love indian food can somebody please help out here
is there a fantastic indian restaurant in las_vegas
hmmm
i can't believe that other yelpers didn't like gandhi
as i have had only excellent dining experiences there
i've never tried the buffet
and have been wanting to
but maybe i won't now after what you guys said about it
i'm also vegetarian
so if their meat is horrible
i have no idea about that
i have had the narvatan korma twice
excellent
and the aloo palak
yum
you can tell it's full of butter
but who cares it's so good
the first times i was there they brought pappadoms as an appetizer
i was a little disappointed when they didn't on my last visit
not usually crowded unless you're there at peak dinner time on weekends
the room is kind of cavernous
i wouldn't want to sit right in the middle surrounded by tables of people
try to get one of the super comfy booths around the outside
waiters are nice and super cute
kinda marginal indian food why go here when you go down paradise to origin india which is great
i went here a bunch of times before i found out about origin for the lunch buffet and once for dinner
it's just basically a standard indian place
but certainly nothing_to_write_home_about
not bad
just not good
i'd keep looking
i wasn't looking for indian food
i was looking for cvs
so i could get some excedrin for my headache
but i turned into the wrong stripmall
and passed gandhi
no
not that gandhi
he's dead
gandhi the restaurant
what caught my attention were the people
dozens of indian people headed into the restaurant
hmm
best of las_vegas
proclaimed the banner
in this place
what the heck
my last vegas review was fatburger
let's diversify a bit
the restaurant itself is well appointed
clean
comfy
check
lots of people on the buffet line
is there a buffet tonight
no
they said
that's just for the private party
which turned_out_to_be a busload of indian people
no matter
i looked at the menu
and ordered one of their combo dishes
along with a large flying horse
within minutes
complimentary papadum arrived
along with a tamarind_sauce and a cilantro sauce
to my surprise
the papadum were awesome
hot
crisp
tasty
the sauces were excellent as well
the combo arrived and the food continued to impress
i haven't had indian food this tasty and authentic since i was back in ny
one thing i disliked was the dish a metal plate with compartments which reminded_me_of a tv dinner
i would have preferred to see several small plates
but i guess that would be more work
the combo included a choice of dessert
and i passed up my usual kheer in favor of a pistachio kulfi ice_cream recommended by my server
it was amazing
except for the spoon
see below
reading the other reviews
either they have improved dramatically
or perhaps i was the beneficiary of stumbling on this place on a night where they knew they had to have their a game on
or risk upsetting said busload of people
i would award stars
except that my napkin was slightly dirty
and the spoon accompanying my dessert was clearly dirty as well
as in the dishwasher didn't do a good job
i left stuffed and content
aka
feeling very un gandhi like
this place isn't as good as orgin india
just down the street
or india_palace
also just down the street
but you can do a lot worse
we have dined here a few times
with our year_old
and we had a great time
the food is good not stellar but good
it has what i consider to be a run of the mill americanized northern indian menu
typical selection of indian beers
staff_was_very_friendly
food was great quality
everything we have ordered has been good
the buffet is ok here
i actually enjoyed dinner much more
i got one of the tandoori sets which was pretty good
i'd rather go to other places for an indian lunch buffet
but the atmosphere is kinda
eh
here compared to some of the other places around which is why this wouldn't be my first choice
average food
good
traditional and ethnic atmosphere
buffet items are often cold and limited
service is rude
unless you are an ethnic indian
they often take your food away while you are still eating and do not like to answer questions
i prefer tamba restaurant myself
which i hear is managed by same individuals
however
they just started managing this place
so maybe there are good things to come
we shall see
i've never had such a bad experience with indian food
the food was serve on a metal tray like the one in prisons
its terrible and it is rediculousy expensive for the qaulity and portion
unbelievable
spend your money elsewhere
again
uninspired indian in vegas
the service was poor during the sunday dinner rush
and the naan i ordered was burnt to the point that it was almost inedible
the greasy pakora and dry curry were not helped by my continuously empty water_glass
pass
everything about this place was just so so including the service
nothing was really bad but nothing stands_out
had decent lamb_vindaloo
asked for extra_spicy but not so spicy
chickent tikka masala
malai_kofta and a couple different naans which weren't that great
still looking for a good cheap eats indian in vegas
this place is a little pricey though not as ridiculously overpriced as gaylords
if your craving decent indian food and not afraid to spend a couple bucks then this place should fit the bill
i ate here a long time ago when it was just a vegetarian place
but now i think they got new management
new interior design
and most_importantly new chefs
i went for lunch buffet and dinner
the buffet was excellent
well flavored
the only flaw is you have to go up to the buffet to get naan
so everyone was just waiting until they make some
then everyone rushes to it
really good food
reasonably_priced
but it's not as_good_as_it_gets
stars
i went here with a friend from vegas on his reccomendation and at first was a little put off by the outside of the place as it didn't look so nice
but looks can be deceiving
the inside of ghandi's is very nice
their service_was_prompt and their food was pretty good
not the best indian i have ever had but definitely solid food
next time i'm back in vegas i would try soemthing different but i would not be afraid to return here
located in a weird angled funky strip i came here to satisfy my indian food binge
this restaurant is large and looks as if it hosts banquets and members of the community
i have only had indian at one other restaurant
gandhi does offer a wide_variety of dishes
there are over vegetarian entrees
there are some nans and baked breads i have never seen before and i love the breads
my friend had tandoori prawns which even in san_francisco i don't see at all
there are a few dishes i will order next time just for the sheer fact i can't find these dishes at home
whoever gave this place more then one star has never eaten indian food before
the food was very bland
and expensive
for
including soft_drinks for a lunch buffet
besides being very bland there was a serious issue of meat
there was almost none
just a little bit of chicken in their dishes
and the tandoori_chicken left a lot to be disired
thats it
no beef somosas or lamb or goat
this was my second time here
the first was yrs ago
sadly the place hasn't improved
food
service
had the gandhi thali a sampler of vegetarian items
the malai_kofta was tasty
but the mattar_paneer was blah and had only one small chunk of cheese
the samosa had a tender crust
for dinner
it would be better to go with a group so you can choose the things to share
service was ok but unexceptional
i'd like to go back for lunch to try their buffet
having just got off the plane from la and having not eaten for several hours
i was on the verge of passing out
not really
but i was feeling pretty peckish
jeff and i were driving towards the hotel
when i spotted gandhi out of the corner of my eye
knowing that he likes india
having lived there for over a year
i thought he might like to try
i am always willing to try a new indian place
i got a combination plate that had chicken_tikka
some marinated chicken
kafta chopped up and a grilled shrimp
the plate also came with some lentils
rice
raita
lettuce
paneer in a curry_sauce and a curry with shrimp in it
jeff got a vegetarian plate that had the same rice
raita and lentils
but he also got a cauliflower dish
i don't remember_the_name
and some other curried vegetable
he ate it all
so i know he liked it
but i don't think he loved it
i loved pretty much everything i got
except the lentils
they needed something
salt
the paneer was delicious
it reminded_me_of the fresh cheese my grandmother used to make
the shrimp_curry was delicious
just_the_right_amount_of heat to it
the raita was tasty
the rice was nothing special
i liked the naan
i ate several pieces and i don't normally do that
jeff ordered a mango_lassi
he asked that they make it special with no milk
just yogurt
they did that and he loved it
he might have ordered another
if he weren't so full
the service started off really well
but then it went downhill from there
we got the food and then we never saw the waiters again
they were busy serving others
so
we waited forever for the bill and a box to take home the leftovers
the decor was kinda nice
kinda funky
kinda dark and kinda fashionable
i liked certain parts of the restaurant
like the giant wooden ganesh near the entrance
the red on the walls was nice
the paintings weren't anything special
they turned up the lights for us
so we could read the menu
there were some special rooms that could be shut off with curtains
i liked that touch
i would_definitely_go_back
i wonder what the buffet would have been like
since we were there for dinner
the food was superb
the service
well
it was clear our party was a burden to the server
we weren't told that we'd be charged extra for things like rice and bread
even though the server kept bringing us more
i'm not sure how much each side of rice was
but it was really expensive and they didn't bring us a complimentary portion for our entrees
the portions were tiny
think happy meal tiny
this wouldn't be a problem if the prices weren't so high
all in all
i won't be back
but i'll be looking for another restaurant that has good food
good portions
good prices
and good service
stars just for the food
i've been a fan of this place for several years
my trips to las_vegas are not complete until i've visited the buffet
the quality has been the same all the time
the taste has always been great
and the people there are very friendly
i don't frequent an indian restaurant in los angeles as much as i have in las_vegas
looking_forward to more food next time i go
alright
this is another place that you have to know how to do right
i have been here for lunch and dinner
and lunch is totally the way to go
they have a really tasty indian buffet with lots of options
i am not sure which ones are gluten_free
so the next time i go back to vegas
i'll have more to report
the service is alright
i usually go thirsty for water
remember
your lassi is not included in the buffet price
they do have large bus tours of people who come here en masse
so rub your rabbit's foot to make sure you don't show up at the same time
dinner is table service
which isn't the most awesome
and provides less value than the buffet
great vegetarian selections
again
will update this again with gf facts
the best value for indian food in vegas
gandhi features a very solid indian lunch buffet that can sometimes miss the mark slightly depending_on the particular variety they put out for the day and how well it matches your personal preferences
the location isn't the greatest
inside a rather nasty east flamingo strip_mall next to a cigar shop
but they do a good job of making you forget this once you enter the establishment
a hole_in_the_wall place
indian owned
i like how when you walk in you feel like you are in a real indian restaurant
complete with a hindu elephant god statue there
there were lots of indian customers eating there
food is ok
bucks lunch buffet
def get the off coupon from hotel magazines
i don't really know my indian food
so hard to judge it's authenticity
not the best i've had
but def edible
naan_bread
salad
tandori_chicken
sauces were good
skip on the curry
lunch buffet was very crowded on the weekend long line
but water drink service was still good
a wide_variety of food nan was actually out in the buffet line which was nice to see done
only thing was the plastic utensils bothered me
i could live with the plastic water cups but plastic forks and spoons seem like picnic items and eating tandori_chicken with them proves difficult
i was glad to see a well_stocked buffet even with such a crowd
good food but not the best to bring me back often mango_lassi was okay too
after a week of all_you_can_eat in vegas
what do you do next
have ayce indian food of course
back in college
my buddies and i would always swing by gandhi india cuisine at the end of each visit to vegas
nothing cures a hang over like nice buttery
saucy
and oiling indian food
it really isn't that disgusting when eating it
brian from family guy describes indian food as
brian is so hungry he eats stewie's diaper
hey
at least its better than indian food
that's exactly how i feel
indian food quality is always hit_or_miss
if you cannot stomach
ethnic
foods
i don't recommend trying indian food
but if you have a taste for adventure and have a strong stomach then try it
i love garlic_naan and curry chicken
there are a lot of other items and sauces that i'm not sure what they are
but they taste delicious
be warned you will have a food coma after your gandhi experience
the restaurant is family_owned and servers make you feel at home
i went a few times with indian friends to help explain what everything is to me
this place is hard_to_find
it is near terrible casino and behind a morton's steakhouse restaurant i think
near a massage parlor just off the strip
i think the way i first discovered_this_place was through a coupon in a las_vegas magazine
my friends were semi serious about going
it was a very hot day and our car broke down right in the same plaza
call it fate or luck
i don't believe in luck
in vegas
its all skill
i've been told this is some of the best_indian_food_in_town
oh boy am i in trouble
i miss good indian food
my trip_to_vegas is not complete without the fountains at the bellagio
the lions at mgm and a few other places that i can't mention here
but last but not the least is gandhi india cuisine's exquisite lunch buffet
i've been to vegas
for various reasons
times and had lunch at this restaurant
don't_get_me_wrong
i am sure there are people who prefer the wide spread buffets at the casinos
but this one is no less
the food is well cooked and the arrangement is nice
the price is
if i still remember
all_you_can_eat
isn't that sweet
its about a mile or so from the strip in a strip_mall
enjoy
there is a lot of indian_cuisine competition but this place does have great service and great comfort_food at a good price
i really enjoy the neighborhood competition
mint_indian_bistro and origin of india more though
but there is something about this place that continues to keep itself standing
despite this
i would definitely go here if i had more friends who like indian food or ate out as much as i used to
this place is a lot older
but i live right up the street from this place and if i got tired of frequenting mint_indian_bistro on flamingo
i would go here to get a change of setting
i think it is a little more authentic than the mint
but i am not a fan of authentic
i like a little bit of flare to my food that is catered to americans
my friend likes this place more than mint
so maybe they have some special dishes that stand out for vegetarians
again
because it sits in a terrible neighborhood
the fact that it still survived the many years of recession probably says a lot about the authenticity of their dishes
i don't know a lot about their off the buffet menu entrees but i hear they are pretty good
the decor has antique wood and has a fine_dining appeal with the table cloth and nice water_glass
but
this seems to be a common theme for all of the indian_restaurants
they are very properly set
the indian food buffet is a good deal
but if i had patience i would order_off_the_menu because they will cook it to order and the food will taste fresh and more flavorful
the restaurant is very simple and plain on the outside
once you enter
the decor is simple
yet nice
the atmosphere and music is upbeat
service was good and the food here is good
but nothing compared to baluchi's in new york
i was there with a group and we ordered mango_lassi
a variety of naan
chicken_vindaloo
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_biryani
and more
the place is worth a try if you are out in vegas and are willing to explore outside of the strip
good atmosphere
once you get inside
knowledgeable helpful staff
lamb was tough
but vegetarian picks were good
solid value in the all_you_can_eat lunch buffet
carb overload usually sets in minutes_later but worth it
the service is okay the decor works
they could turn down the music a little
it felt a little cluby during the day
they have a chutney with olives that i put on most everything
it's spicy and bitter at the same time but i like it
all of the dishes are prepared with quality in mind
this yelper likes the lunch
i am indian so not to mention i know how to make indian food
during recent trip_to_vegas
i had lunch buffet for
at this restaurant
food was so terrible in terms of spices that it broke all the records of high spices i had ever tasted in my life
if this is the quality of food served at gandhi restaurant and people are revisiting this place that means either they have no clue of indian recipe or they really love very high spices
i went to gandhi's while in vegas with a friend_of_mine from high school back in july
if you don't know where this place is
chances are you probably won't find it as it is hidden within a strip_mall and you would think it was closed down if you didn't know any better
we_were_seated_immediately as it appeared that my friend knew everyone in the place
everyone made sure to come over and say hello and to constantly check on us all evening
i actually felt_like a celebrity with all the attention we were getting
anyway enough about that
onto the food
we ordered the paneer_pakora which was homemade deep_fried cottage_cheese
gosht vindaloo
and the chicken makhanwala along with tons of nan
i was in indian food heaven
the lamb was cooked_to_perfection and the chicken had a nice blend_of_spices and the sauce was divine
i am sitting here licking my lips still remembering just how good it was
this place is a nice little hidden_gem that you should really try if you are ever in vegas
you do realize that it means you will have to explore outside of the strip so venture if you dare
amazing food and beautiful decor
really enjoyed my visit and will definitely go again
this review is for the lunch buffet only
i've never been dissappointed
well
that's not true
i'm on the verge of tears when they run out of naan
which is a frequent occurrence for the lunch buffet
but
it's one of my favored lunchtime stops
plenty of vegeterian options
and they have enough variety that it's rarely same combination of dishes
they really won me over with their okra dish
magnificient
muah
that's what sticks out in my head the most
so i guess the rest is good but not necessarily spectactular
it is in a somewhat seedy strip_mall
but heck
some of vegas' greats share that characteristic
lotus of siam anyone
interior decor i find quite pleasing
the lunch buffet will run you around
so middle of the road pricewise
too
i think this belong on your list if you're racking up your checklist of vegas' indian_buffets
i want to give minimum possible star
horrible food
worst customer_service
while eating the dinner buffet
i have been asked twice
i mean guy couldn't see me eating the food
tiniest bowl i have ever seen at this place
you can't even take out the curry with a spoon out of that bowls
please don't waste your money at this place
avg and expensive food
we went for dinner
aloo tiki was pieces of fried dough
green chutney felt_like spolied cilantro smoothie
dal_makhani there was nothing makhani about it just dome boiled lentils
the nan with nuts was so sweet and had only coconut and no nuts
if u tell them what the problem in food they just completely ignore u rather than fix it
so don't go by menu descriptions they just do whatever is convenient to them and use left_overs
a big avoid
guys please avoid this place at least for buffet
i'm not allowed to give no rating else would have done that
we just came back from vegas i couldn't stop myself from writing review for this place
being an indian knows how indian food taste
smell
looks like
believe me it was nothing like that
the menu was ok nothing fancy for the price you pay
here is list of items in vegetarian sect
yellow daal
rajma
any damn indian can make that better than what they had
shahi panner
tasted just like heinz ketchup
aloo baigan
big chunk of uncook potatoes
naan
it took forever to get them
we told them times that there is no naan how are we supposed to eat all above items
rice
we didnt cared about that as we left within mins of our so called lunch bufftet
onion pakora
cold pakora
have you ever ate one
idli
hard as stone
they made it days_ago to serve it
sambhar
sambhar was way tooo spicy trust_me when an indian says too spicy it is
the service is really really really bad
they dont care that you want something or not
they were behaving as if they are doing big favor on us by attending us
ohhh guys cmon
its one of the buffet you never want to waste your money
believe me
the scenery is pretty nice here
from the outside
you can't see much and the place looks secluded
but once you're inside
the place is actually pretty nicely_decorated inside
food here was decent
i still feel like india_palace had better food just because the food was hotter
then again
that might just depends on when they run out of food and have to put new ones in
i would say ghandhi has more selection on food
it was just a little disappointing since they didn't have that popular chicken dish i like
service was fine
ohhh myyy agahhh
ghandi has this lunch buffet that you cannot beat
sometimes i daydream about the food the next day
that's not normal for me
sometimes i will think about who would be willing to go with me for sunday lunch
i can assure you that every_single person i have ever introduced to indian food by taking them here has begged me to go back immediately
if you've never had indian food
its the perfect place to start because you can pick and choose
it's addicting and you can't really beat the price for a buffet of about per_person
the food is so flavorfuls and there is always a ton of variety to choose from
the outside is nothing_to_write_home_about
located in a sketchy parking_lot area but inside its like a beautiful indian palace of deliciousness
the service is nice
like the cashier makes jokes sometimes that i don't immediately understand
but then eventually i do
my boss wanted to go here
so we had to
the decor is a bit dark but nice and clean
i thought it was a bit pricey for the limited selection
food is flavorful though
already been back a few times
wow
such an upgrade since i used to spend countless lunch_buffets with coworkers
back in the day when i used to work in the howard hughs pkway offices
i took my wife there for lunch just last week
the grub
chutneys and sauces galore
plenty of your veggie favorites
stewed chick_peas
saag_paneer
spinach with cheese
curry potatoes and peas
fried onion dumplings
and other dishes all delicious
meat too tandori grilled chicken
chicken_tikka
butter_chicken
etc
got bread and carbs
basatmi rice
naan
rice cakes
spicy noodle dish
samosas
all good
dessert
mango_custard with fruit
fried brown sugar pastries in a sugary syrup sauce
and fresh fruit yummy
hot tea
coffee
mango_lassi
sodas and juices available
the joint
such a turn around from when i used to frequent years back
the white table clothes have been replaced by all wood tables covered by fancy black linens
the open balcony now houses private dining areas perfect for parties that want an intimate booth
even the buffet section is granite counter tops with built in buffets fancy
much fancier than the old tables with the buffet heat trays
indian decor many intricate paintings and woodwork abound
including a huge wooden hand carved goddess at the entry
floor to ceiling curtains and fabrics of india surround you
very nice
plenty of seating
clean and upscale
especially for a buffet
the squeeze
friendly_and_attentive service as always
about per_person for lunch a little pricey
cash and card accepted
the final say
my wife and i enjoyed our lunch buffet
and it kept us full for most of the day
and for me
it was such a pleasant surprise to see that the owner has done so much to upgrade on such a great indain buffet restaurant
i go for the buffet
i have no_idea_what i'm eating but it tastes great
the service is excellent
yummy
we had dinner here and it was the best_indian_food_i_have_ever had
can't to try their_lunch_buffet the next time we are in vegas
everything is ala_carte so it can get pricey but well worth it
great food
avg
price
spicy enough to stimulate your taste_buds
good service
great tomato_soup
bhindi_masala
chana_masala
naan
jeera rice
dal
great interior
location and view from outside dose not reflect that this is located in las_vegas
dull and dark from outside
definitely will go again
woman cannot live from liquor alone so at some point i had to eat
being a pissed off hungry vegetarian in a city catered to meat_eaters
i began to feel aggressive
then i drove down paradise road and saw a sign that read gandhi
i remembered the concept of ahimsa all of a sudden
took a deep breath
and figured that the food gods were on my side
i walked inside and saw meat on the plates of other patrons
i was mildly annoyed since gandhi was a vegetarian and i normally would have been a pain in the ass about it
but i was so desperate for food that i was willing to sacrifice my principles for the good of my stomach
i asked the server if there were a few vegetarian_dishes present at the buffet
and he smiled and proceeded to show me the goods
after correctly guessing that i am from california
a vegetarian twenty something with a serious sense of entitlement
where else could i be from
i proceeded to eat this excellent
varied
and overpriced lunch
surrounded by friendly_staff who were attentive but not overbearing
i had such a great meal that i made my friends go there with me again the next day
i highly_recommend this place to vegetarian tourists
don't be deceived by the outside
this restaurant is located at the end of a strip_mall
there's a simple neon sign outside and when you walk in it's a bit frightening for a moment
then you turn the corner and see a beautiful restaurant not what you'd_expect
the ceilings are high
the tables have high backs so you have a little more privacy
there are rooms that have curtains that can be drawn
and it's dimly lit
the food is very good and the prices_are_reasonable and can't compare to anything on the strip
this is based_on my recent visit
end of sept
food there was delicious
specially butter_chicken and paneer masala
yum
me and my wife were amazed on how good tasting both entrees were
for a buffet
great food and great service
i have only eaten the lunch buffet which is good
i really enjoy the variety of food and the must have mango_lassi drinks
yummy
my wife and i have been coming to this restaraunt since for one very important reason
they treat us like family
we've experienced other indian venues
but according to my taste_buds
nothing compares
the food is great if you are into strong herbs and spices
i dont know what is in most dishes
but thats not important if the grub is smack good
i know one of my faves is chicken masala
they have a selective buffet from pm pm for
which is a great option for those who want to dib and dab here and there to see if this kind of cuisine is your thing
the interior is exotic and the music is indian pop which all adds to the dining_experience
when you come in
ask for a server named megiddo
i swear he is ghandi reincarnated
my wife and i have tried only the lunch buffet
since they do not serve from the menu during lunch
maybe i have been spoiled by the excellent indian food in and around san_francisco
i
e
pakwan
shalimar
and others
at any rate the food at ghandi is mediocre and overpriced
for the lunch buffet
loaded with bland vegetarian_dishes and a few chicken scrap entrees
oh
well
i may try another indian restaurant in las_vegas
though i may just wait until the next time i'm in san_francisco
despite being located in a seedy strip_mall
a friend and i had previously tried this place for dinner
and it was decent
star territory
however a recent visit to try their_lunch_buffet was a different story
the first thing that stuck out was the cheap plastic plates
disposable plastic eating utensils
and styrofoam plastic cups for water and soups sauces
i have been to many indian_lunch_buffets
but this was the first time i've seen such cheap dining ware being used
while they had several vegetarian offerings
they only had a couple of mediocre meat dishes
chicken_tikka_masala and tandoori_chicken
there was a huge tray of naan which looked overly doughy and dried_out so i didn't even bother trying it
the subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit
the halwa dessert was extremely dry and just gross
my friend and i commented that the only thing at the buffet that they seemed to do pretty well was the basmati_rice
when the bill came
i was in for another shock
for an indian lunch buffet
that has got to make this the priciest one in town since most are in the range of
to
now if this buffet was one of the best
i probably wouldn't mind paying a premium price
come to think of it
if they lowered the price to
it still wouldn't be worth it
there are just too many better places_in_town
i
e
taj_palace or mt_everest
to waste your appetite on this one
came across this place when i visited las_vegas just before christmas and wanted to find a place to have indian food
ordered a chicken_biryani carryout order since dinner buffet was almost on the verge of completion
let me explain here i am a food lover and can instantly say by the look of indian_restaurants on what kind of food to expect
there are different versions of
authentic
indian cuisines floating around and i must say this is not one of them
biryani was sweet
authentic biryani is never sweet
with cashew and raisins
good luck with this place
from a shady looking
wrecked place from outside to a exquisite ethnic indian loungish looking interiors this restaurant really did surprise me
we infact planned to turn around go elsewhere looking at it from outside
and we are glad not to have done that
the restaurant has a lotta potential to be turned into an indian nightclub lounge at night
thanks to their multiple rooms
multiple floors
red interior decor and tall ceilings
we took the lunch buffet which i felt was kinda ok
the best part of all was the tandoori_chicken
delishhh
one of the best i've tried
the rest were passable
their mango_lassi was pretty good however
overall i felt aint a bad deal for a quick indian lunch quite close to the strip in a grand setting
the food was terrific
soooooo
good
i could eat their nan for the rest of my life
i will_definitely_go_back
the parking however
is sketchy and i was quite concerned leaving my car outside
the service was probably the worst i have ever had
my server never said a single word to my table the entire time we were there
we were never asked if we wanted anything to drink or anything
very very strange
i do not think the parking is sketchy
it is vegas folks
it is a city
get over it
decor music was rather odd
i liked it personally
but was far from what i would consider
indian
buffet food was ok
but rather bland
all of the dishes tasted as if they had used the exact same recipe
the spice_level was non existent which is a deal breaker for me and indian food
although the outside is not spectacular
i was impressed with their set up and buffet service
i was feeling the mood
the music
the food aroma
the curtains
etc
it was a nice place and our waiter was very attentive and funny
the food was delicious and i thoroughly_enjoyed every dish
mango_lassi was to die for
overall
lunch buffet price is within inexpensive affordable
i will be sure to make a trip here whenever i go to vegas
went for buffet lunch
the food is ok and reasonable
the variety is good
maybe a dish or two more for the vegetarians needed
decor is ok
adult price is
and kids is
great for out of towners who crave indian food
this was the best indian restaurant my parents liked
they r vegeterrian and were happy to see lot of veggi options
their food is like home and desserts
sevayian kheer
was awesome
i absolutely recommend brunch buffet
good north_indian lunch and south_indian breakfast
overall a good place to have a brunch
for gandhi
i had to make myself stop_eating because i was so full
but it was sooooo good
in las_vegas for business
four of us went here for dinner after a long day
i really wasn't in the mood for indian food
but i was too tired to try to talk the other into going somewhere_else
i'm_so_glad i didn't protest
the restaurant looks like a nothing hole_in_the_wall in a strip center
but it's very nicely_decorated on the inside
a young ish sihk guy
who may have been an owner or manager
just got that impression
greeted us and took our orders
he has super_nice
and i got a kick out of how
when my boss was being a heinous jerk for no reason per usual
the guy would just look at me and laugh
awesome
the buffet looked amazing so i opted for that
i was planning on waiting until everyone_else got their food to dig into the buffet
but as everyone_else was ordering
our server tapped me on the shoulder and whispered
go get your food now
trust_me
just go
i was totally confused
but he seemed very polite and earnest about it
so i did
not two minutes_later
an entire busload of indians on a site seeing tour came pouring in and lined up at the buffet
so glad he told me to go
almost the entire buffet was vegetarian
score
and it was all good
the mattar_paneer was amazing
i could have sat there and eaten that all night until i exploded
i've never had indian food that good before
i will be back next_time_i'm_in_vegas
if i have to leave my curry fury boyfriend at the hotel and eat that mattar_paneer by myself
i will have it again
thanks for the great
friendly service and the beyond delicious food
best food i've had in vegas so far
my boyfriend and i loved everything we had
i'm a vegetarian he's not
our service was a bit spotty
we had to wait a good minutes for our bill
and i never got the dessert that came with my meal after ordering it
i would rate this if our service had been better
we beat the dinner rush thankfully
when we walked in there were only ten other customers
when we walked out
that number had at least tripled
the ambiance was intimate and the restroom was one of the cleanest i've seen in this city
my family went there and had a great time
the decor is very good looking
the service was slow they listen to everything you say
the best thing is that the waiters are very friendly and are very conversational
the food was ok the lamb vindulu is delicious and the ice coffee was awesome
i would recommend this restaurant to anyone
not a good service experience after the third time
they give preference to people who arrive after you and i would not reccomend going there
terrible experience from the owner
i have to take back my four stars review about this fine indian_cuisine
that make me every time happier
we recently went to the buffet on the labor day weekend and
it was amazing experience
the food selection was excellent and we had few items out of the regular menu
still love the service
also the place
i like gandhis
always have
sure
the parking is sketchy
and i wouldn't live in the adjoining neighborhood if they paid me
and there's at least guy that lives
or least weekends
by the dumpsters
but this restaurant is very very good with an awesome buffet
beautiful decor and quality service
and that's all i can ask of them to be
looking for good indian restaurant in las_vegas for years
we finally found
the one
everything about
gandhi
is good
maybe location is a little farther than i would like
decor
rich dark colors
very spacious rooms
food
excellent
papadom
compliments of the chef
light crispy
not overly spicy
for starters we ordered paneer_pakora
very good seasoned excellent appetizer
mulligantawny soup
be prepared to unusual preparation
not what you would expect
but very good
entries
chicken_tikka_masala omg
best tikka masala i ever had
fish korma
this dish is not on a menu
but i asked if it would be possible to prepare it for us
that's another big star to gandhi restaurant
every our request was accommodated
they try to make your dinner a real
experience
which gives a great feeling of being taken_care_of
back to entries eggplant bharta
we asked to make it mild
well
you can not really make this dish mild it is meant to be spicy
but hey managed
funny
mild on a beginning it gives you a
kick
a couple of sends later
we actually asked to make another one like it
so we can take it home
naan
excellent
another item we ordered more for take out
we enjoyed later
prices
surprisingly inexpensive
the portions are quite big
we ordered mango_lassie
which was twice the size of any lassie we had before
price however was
i almost was ready to say to our waiter that this is to cheap
and they should raise the price
but
of course i did not say anything
overall great restaurant
if you get a chance stop here and you won't regret it
my fiance and i were on a mini vaca for the weekend
we had just gotten out of a unlv game and had no idea where to eat
we didn't want to go back on the busy strip and came across gandhi
i love indian food and haven't seemed to find any i like since leaving sacramento for arizona
we were there for holiday and so the restaurant was strictly buffet
which the owner said is not usually the case
the assortment of foods was the best i've seen on any buffet
plenty of options for meat_eaters and vegetarians alike
everyone was friendly
in fact in some cases they were a little too on top of their game
perhaps checking in on us a little too much
we knew from the moment we walked in a saw the place packed that we were at the right spot
i will be back there and only wished i lived closer
lunch buffet is perfect
i am all about indian_buffets
the price here is good too
went here for lunch with co_workers and had a great time
plenty to choose from
the potatoes that have spinach in it is amazing
the naan is nothing_to_write_home_about
and some other just okay dishes
for sure try the butter_chicken
best of all it's not too heavy
i was on a vacation with my girl friend was craving_for_indian_food
finally on the busy strip
i found gandhi
though i'm an indian
its been long i had indian food
we were there for the buffet
the place was packed
there were lots variety of foods and is one of the best buffets
plenty of options for non vegetarians and even for vegetarians like me
navratna korma was awesome
crew was friendly and were prompt in serving
they made_us_feel like at home which justifies the crowd inside
it is definitely a good indian restaurant
this place has thali's with different names like bengali thali
south_indian thali etc
thali with names from every part of india
but each thali has more or less the same food punjabi food
like chicken_tikka nan and dal
i had ordered south_indian thali and thought he had got the wrong order
when i told_him about it
he told me i should have read the menu more carefully
he told me no_matter_what the name
it only has punjabi food
i felt cheated by them and left
they did charge me about for that fake thali
review is for the lunch buffet
not the best buffet in vegas and not the cheapest
running about
but you can expect some good spice from the buffet options
what sets gandhi india cuisine's buffet aside from other indian_buffets in vegas is the surprising spice
the general tendency in an indian buffet is to keep it bland
the buffet has to make a lot of different palates happy and the general tendency is to keep it bland to make the most folks happy
but cheers to gandhi for not skimping on the spice
they usually have several vegetarian_options in the buffet and a number of delicious chicken dishes
there's some real hit and miss going on with the dishes
i loved the paneer in spicy butter cream and the chicken_tikka_masala
and thumbs_up for the naan and the okra dish
that said
many of the dishes simply fall flat
problem is
at
this is one of the more expensive non strip buffets and it is simply just not spectactular
wow
driving down flamingo and saw a couple of indian food joints
ghandi had an authentic feel
after going inside and seeing a buffet style set up
i was a little thrown off
after asking the lady
she explained you can either do the buffet or order_off_the_menu
i decided to stay because there were so many people there
the food was so good
so good that i went back for dinner the same night
for dinner i ordered off the menu
there is no buffet at night anyways
and i cannot believe the results
the food off the menu was even better than the buffet
which was already some of the best indian food i've had
i will be eating here every chance i get every time i'm in vegas
favs
chicken masala
lentil soup
basmati_rice
garlic_naan
the dessert buffet
make sure to combine them
awesome customer_service
we visit this place every time we are in vegas
but on dec th they only had dinner buffet and when we told the manager
laddi
we were leaving cause we couldn't order our favorite dish
malai paneer
he had the kitchen make it for us
we felt so special and taken_care_of
u guys gotta try this place
u wont be disappointed
lunch buffet
food was ok
ridiculous
utterly ridiculous
i just called and attempted to place an order by telephone
i was promptly asked to call back in minutes
what kind of business asks a potential customer to call back
i apologized for bothering them and informed them that i wouldn't be giving them my business
sorry about it
when we entered the restaurant
the buffet time was almost over
erik kept the buffet on hold for us and even arranged for fresh and hot roti
totally adds a star to our trip_to_vegas
worst customer_service
the dude doesn't even know where the guest are seated
allotted our table twice to others while we are grabbing the food from buffet
we've been going here for years and today was very likely the last time
sad to say
the parking_lot was surprisingly empty and i guess we now know why
my wife normally loves the tandori_chicken but today it was extremely dry and unedible
we told our waiter about it and he takes the piece of dry chicken from our table and takes it to the back kitchen and seemed to tell the cook that the chicken was bad
well
no follow up
no apology and he seemed to laugh it off with the female waitress that seemed to be flipping the dry pieces
just picking at them
i've kind of noticed the food was getting lower in quality lately
but didn't say much since it was my wife's favorite indian lunch buffet
even the solidly prepared mango_lassi was full of ice pieces
didn't taste good and didn't arrive to the table until my plate was nearly finished
i didn't even go for seconds
since there really wasn't anything worth going back for
we have other choices for indian food and next time it won't be here
maybe they changed owners
i went for dinner and ordered the tandoori_chicken
it was very tender and flavorful
the atmosphere is also great
i am on atkins diet lately and i highly_recommend their tandoori_chicken
one order is more than enough for even two people
i had a great experience when i ate here a few days_ago
i started with the tandoori mix grill
this plate had a nice mix of chicken
lamb
and prawns
it all tasted great
for the main_course we had the chicken_tikka and the prawn curry
both these dishes had just_the_right_amount_of spices and filled with taste
if you have never tried indian_cuisine
make sure this is the st indian restaurant you try
the food will not disappoint
worst food we had in vegas
couple of my friend had stomach ache after eating here
also for the price its not worth
will not recommend anybody to go here
also the parking_lot was empty
now we know why it was empty
the buffet was amazing and the service_was_prompt
lamb_curry was tender and delicious
the samosa was the best i have ever had and the mango_custard was a perfect finish
i would highly_recommend this restaurant
very clean and hygienic
love the ambience and openness
much better than overcrowded restaurants right on the strip
service is awesome
waiters are very kind
always available and seem to want you to ask them for things
food is absolutely_amazing
i've never had better indian food in my life
tastes very fresh
chicken dishes are very juicy and succulent
other indian_restaurants just don't match up to the quality of food
i would_definitely_recommend_this_place to everyone
my vegas trip was complete after coming here
i'm definitely coming_back
one of my favorite indian_restaurants ever
the layout makes you feel at home and helps enjoy your experience
the staff is great and friendly
the food is outstanding
the lamb was cooked_to_perfection which is hard_to_find
the menu offers a lot of variety for both meat_eaters and vegetarians
i will_be_coming_back for sure
i try to find an indian restaurant in almost every city i visit because i love it so
i've made three visits to gandhi's while in vegas and every time have had an excellent meal with great service
i've even visited the lunch buffet
lunch_buffets can be mediocre and are often bland
but not at gandhi's
good stuff
bacchanal buffet my ass
gandhi buffet it is
the food tastes fresh
there is variety and its delicious
what's not to like for a hungover group of guys
i had a sampling of everything but stuck to my dal chaawal staple which was perfect for me
they have idli
sambhar and upma too for the average south_indian
when a buffet costs
you would think they would invest in cutlery
nope
although the plates are ceramic
very light
the cups are 'take out' material cups and the spoons look metallic but they are 'faux' metal spoons
the fork bent while cutting into my idli
haha
come on guys
invest a bit more
will be back
went there and the food was decent but the service was aweful
my girlfriend and i were the only ones in there and they took forever to come back to our table or even bring the check
we just wanted to leave
good value for your buck
very close to the strip
what happened here
when i was here for dinner a little over a year_ago
the buffet
the matter_paneer in particular
was fan flippin tastic
service was great
the food was amazing
and i swore an oath to myself that i would somehow come back here
i was in vegas with my fianc this past weekend and
even though he's not big on indian food
i talked him into having dinner here because of how good it was
womp womp
did they change ownership
there's no such thing as a dinner buffet anymore
well
i can't eat embarrassing amounts at the buffet
but at least i can order the matter_paneer off the menu
i thought
there was one nice host busser
one food runner
and one disinterested waiter
which got to be a problem as the dinner crowd picked_up
the naan was sub par
more burnt air bubbles than anything
my beloved matter_paneer was totally different
it wasn't bad
actually
it was pretty decent
but nowhere near as good as it used to be
we sat at the table
done eating
plates cleared
for a loooong time before i was able to practically tackle the waiter to get our check
had i never been here before
this would have been a
rounded up to stars to be generous experience
but knowing what was and what could have been
this mostly left me disappointed and apologizing to my fianc for misleading him
the tomato_soup was out of the world
the most delicious i ever had
better than many restaurents in india
my family and i used to go to this place all the time to get our indian fix but ever since they got new management the food started tasting different and the overall quality went don't
seriously they don't even give you real glasses or utensils to use
they also let go the best servers which really made the place so welcoming and
homey
had this place last_night and it was very good
ordered the tandoori mixed_grill
chicken_tikka_masala
paneer kadhai and all three dishes were hot and flavorful
the service_was_a_bit_slow and since there were only few other tables being used thought it would've been better
maybe they were a little short on staff since it was a tuesday night
would've given stars if the service more on the spot
the food was ok at best
we want on monday in the after noon and it looks like they were serving food left over from the past weekend
why was i surprised
after all this place has many two star_review
i guess because i've eaten here before and thought the food was pretty good
but there's more to a restaurant than the quality of the food
so briefly here's my prob with this place
first
they raise their prices when they feel it's appropriate christmas week
yes
the week
not the day
how do you justify with no additional menu_items
next
naan is part of the buffet and good but dry most buffets serve fresh naan at the table
there was no patek paneer i know
amazing huh
finally
the plastic silverware was just too much
buffet with plastic silverware
so i gave this place another chance for dinner and lunch
it was pretty good still not a big_fan of the obvious downgrade on the silverware department but the food was much better keep it up
lots of tasty vegetarian_dishes even though i'm a meat lover
i was quite surprised that the lunch buffet was more than enough
spices were just right
flavorful and a plethora of dishes including dessert
i would have given it a star but the location and atmosphere needs improvement
be prepared to walk away satisfied and extremely full
love the ambience here
food is just ok
we had buffet here
the food was not so fresh and hot
the owner was generous and nice man
this place is awesome and so far the best indian restaurant in las_vegas
long weekends they always have lunch and dinner buffet which is fabulous and their food is awesome as well
whenever we come to vegas we just eat here
we are vegetarians and they always have lot of options for us compare to other restaurants
we love_this_place and recommend to all vegetarians indian food lovers
the service was very poor
the atmosphere very average
food was good
even though we were not ask if we wanted our food mild so our food was hot flavored
price was ok till u realize that all food is a la_carte
i did not realize rice was extra with your curry
so be sure to get your side otherwise you will disappointed
overall
i will not come here
fresh food
excellent taste and very nice new owner
i tried a few others and had to go back to gandhi time and again
buffet was excellent too and when ordered service was quick compared to their competitors
i was a big_fan and still am a fan of gandhi
but there r a few major things i would like them to change
first
please do not let us use plastic silverware and plastic water cups
secondly
if customers are in the restaurant
no matter if it is time to close
keep the environment cool
don't switch off the a c mins before closing
it gets really hot on a summer afternoon
unlike in the past
there r now many other comparable indian_restaurants in vegas
i recommend not giving your most faithful customers any reason to move to competitors
i have to say that the good was decent
now i am an indian and i eat at indian_restaurants in nj and india all the time
service really need to be worked on or they will have a hard time
for an indian restaurant in the us i was quite impressed that their plates and cups were clean
restrooms
like all indian_restaurants were dirty and overfilled with fabreez
while we were there paying the check they had a call from a customer complaining about an delivery and it was not handled professionally while there were many others listening to her on the phone
small changes and they could be the best place to eat indian food in vegas
good food
i was surprised to find that they charge for rice though
on the side of curry
doesn't that usually come with it
and
the waiter told me that i couldn't order one of the curries because i was not indian
i think he meant it as a warning about the spice but never the less i thought it was funny and worth mentioning
fyi the wifi password is
iloveganhdi
this place is as good as the other indian_restaurants that i've been to in las_vegas
the food is very good
the portions are still small
but if i go with someone else
i can usually finish their plates as well
one thing that stands_out is the decor
it is beautiful
high ceilings
indian nick knacks hanging all over the place
linen table cloths
etc
the service is fast
and the prices are in line with other indian_restaurants in the area
i will go back if i'm ever on that side of town again
rrally awesome food
malai paneer was excellent and butter naan was too good
even lassi was great too
gandhi is awesome
please don't take my word for it
go try their fish tikka and fish pakora and i bet you you'll fall in love with it
this comes from a foodie who loves authentic fish
some of the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
their naan is to die for and the chicken_tiki_masala is mouth_watering
their_lunch_buffet is damn good too
if you like indian food
you have to try this place
the only place we go for indian besides my kitchen
they have some awesome indian beers too
try the mango dessert
be warned
the vindaloo wasn't spicy at all
the tandoori tikka masala rock
i love it
i love it
i love it
until around a year_ago
this was the best indian restaurant in las_vegas and remains a favorite
on our most recent visit we ordered naan
basmati_rice
chicken_tika marsala and rata lamb
we received naan
basmati_rice
chicken_tika marsala and rata chicken
not a problem because we have never had rata chicken or rata lamb or rata anything for that matter
each entre was both flavorful and spicy
service remains attentive
i can't say i'm an_expert_on_indian cuisine but this is my fav spot in las_vegas
i know the location is questionable at best but the food is worth it
best naan in town
saag_paneer
chicken_tiki_masala and vegetable_korma are great
lunch buffet is but it's a great way to try an assortment of what they have to offer
the place is small but it adds to the ambiance
out of all the indian_restaurants i've tried in vegas
this is the best so far
and i'm pretty picky seeing as i grew_up in an indian household with awesome homecooked indian food almost everyday
the buffet lunches are your best bet
because you can try everything for hella cheap
my favorite is the chicken_tikki_masala
saag_paneer
and of course
their naan
if you're into yogurt drinks
try the sweet lassi
yummilicious
the way i found the india_palace was to ask the locals where they go
over and over the recommendation was the india_palace
this place is consistently good
never fails to please and i've been going here for years
make a point of at least one meal here on every vegas visit
can't_go_wrong here
great service
great food
great price
this place is small and somewhat hidden
their food is pretty good
i'd tried almost all of them and they all taste good
i would come back to this place
they had mango_custard and rice_pudding dessert
rather dark inside
definitely unassuming from the outside
a bit skeptical to give it a shot after cruising through the neighborhood but pleasantly_surprised that i did
an earlier reviewer was right
you can't_go_wrong here
as spicy as you like
i like
with tastefully exotic ambience
well worth the cab fare from the bellagio
there were of us that ate at this crowded and cramped place
with stinky overflowing restrooms in las_vegas
the food was delicious
some dishes could be less greased with butter
but overall the food was good in comparison to mid range indian_restaurants in the us although it was priced higher_than most in its range
the wait was long as there are few tables to seat
restrooms were absolutely a disaster with things overflowing with no attention from the owners
a common problem with most indian_restaurants like this one
if the food is good
the price is high but no funds are diverted to keeping the restaurant clean for a clean experience
where does all the cash go not to the poor low cost undocumented workers
ok
so were from san_francisco
which arguably has the best cuisine in the u
s
so this may be a bit biased
the food is not that great
we went for the buffet and it was really bland
but there were a lot of indian and bangladeshis in the place
which makes me think it must be the only game in town
this review is for the buffet only
after reading the reviews of this place
i was lead to believe it is the best indian place in vegas
after eating here my thoughts are
this is the only indian place in vegas not likely
people in vegas have never had good indian food
people in vegas don't know what good indian food is
my thinking is either or
the food
an assortment of curries which all lack that usual tasteful magicness found in indian_cuisine
the consistency was fine
i've been to some places that have real watery curries
but the blending of spices came out bland and not good
the naan although fluffy tasted like burnt popcorn
i have to say the one saving grace was the rice_pudding
kheer
was actually quite good
i went back for seconds
the atmosphere
typical for an indian restaurant
my_water_glass was filled at appropriate times
they had pleasant light music_playing
as opposed to obnoxious bollywood videos
and the decor is fine
i have to say i did not venture into the bathroom as i was afraid for my life
the next time i am in vegas i will skip this one
my brother found this restaurant
asking local folks where they went for indian food
certainly the outside of it would never have attracted us
but ooooh
the food
the lamb_curry was good
the chicken_vindaloo was delish
and the goat_curry
yes
goat_curry
was to die for
service was swift and friendly
the decor was odd a cross between new delhi and someone's living room but that went weirdly well with the sense that this was
in fact
some fabulous home cooking
when an indian woman gushes to me about an indian restaurant
i usually take her word for it and rush over there and expect a good meal
i mean
i just assumed that she should get to decide what good indian food was
anyway
that's not the point
after we paid and we were waiting for a cab
a bunch of men standing by the door gave_us a handful of seed looking things from the restaurant counter
they put a handful in their mouth and chewed with glee
and told us to eat it
and it tasted like soap pepper seeds
and i kept thinking
what the hell was that
why did i just eat that
anyway
that's not the point either
the point is
i forgot the left over chicken ticca in the trunk of my car
for two days
but after two days it was totally fine and my dad still ate it and said it was good
five_stars
best chicken_tikka_masala i've encountered
it's also one of the few places that ever has dosas readily available and the service is good
since_moving to the bay_area
i've noticed that india_palace is a bit pricey for indian food
but considering that it tastes better than all the indian places i've gone to here in the bay
i'd say that it's worth it
las_vegas lacks a variety of quality ethnic places
luckily
there are few places like india_palace that make up for it
i had the buffet today
i don't think i can give a fair comprehensive review til i've ordered from the menu
buffet is a different animal
ey
but the buffet was damn good
i don't eat much meat
but i just drizzled the sauces from the meat dishes all over my rice and sopped up with naan
flat_bread
i agree with the other reviews that the naan was a little burnt
but maybe that's intentional
it was still fluffy and i kind of like my foods on the charred side anyways
adds character
the naan is not on the buffet line
but a waiter will drop it on your table
i'm assuming so it doesn't dry out under the lamps of the buffet
nice_touch
indians
the meatball sauce was awesome
on the sweet side and i went back for seconds and thirds
the saag_paneer
spinach and cheese
was also good
but the paneer cubes were scant
the kahari goat
house favorite
was a little on the salty side
but still good
on the dinner menu
this dish is
the kheer
rice_pudding
was good
too
not too sweet
but still sweeter than others i've had
their samosas were okay
i like samosa factory's mo bettah
they offer a couple different chutneys
cilantro and
mango maybe
they also served raita
chicken tandoori
aloo_tikki
little fried potato chunks
like indian tater tots
and mango_custard
everything i had was yummy
they have a fat seafood menu
too
but no seafood dishes were offered in the buffet
at least not when we went
their dinner menu looks out of control good
i'm gonna have to go back
a lot
the buffet had a really good variety for only
manfriend got a salt lassi
which was not too salty
for two buffets and one drink
the bill came out to
the restaurant is in a free standing building on twain
east of paradise
dangerously close to school
small parking_lot
the interior was surprisingly well decorated
there's elaborate wood carvings and indian illustrations decorating the walls
the walls are painted flat planes of colors
similar to indian spices
the restaurant is pleasantly under lit
they don't just sport the name
fine indian_cuisine
for fun
tables are elegantly set up with linens and all that fancy crap
waitstaff is nicely dressed in uniform
the bar is constructed with a solid dark wood and there's a large flat screen behind the bar playing shitty bollywood movies
no audio
the nice decor is surprising because most authentically ethnic restaurants are designed as an after thought
like in old country
when we went in
lunch time on a monday
we were only the second party
by the time we left
there were about eight parties
off the strip
non casino
mmmm has a great buffet all_you_can_eat buffet for lunch for a good price
it's monday through sunday
they have just remodeled so there's a bar added to it as well as a larger area to sit
i have been eating at india_palace for ten years
imagine my surprise when i my_favorite_indian_restaurant now completely renovated
the building is now very modern and upgraded
i had the lunch buffet today and was pleasantly_surprised that chicken_tika_masala is now part of the buffet
still my favorite menu item
i highly_recommend the lunch buffet if this is your first foray into indian_cuisine
my only quibble is that the dinner menu averages per entree
a little high
but well worth it in my opinion
my wife and i have waited to try the india_palace we were looking_forward to it very much
but what a disappointment
the place was not clean
the service was awful
the food was
let me say passable at best and nowhere to park
i had the chicken vidaloo
the chicken was fatty and chewy with three pieces of chicken
although it was spicey enough for me
the utensiles were dirty and the plates were not clean enough for me
being from london where the indian_restaurants are excellant i can assure you that our first time will be our last
you will get the customer once but to stay in business you have to attract customers back and on this showing we wont be going back
john
las_vegas
india_palace closed for a few months to renovate
a few very sad months for some friends and i
it completely changed its decor completely modern now and the lighting so much better
food is still excellent and i will come back every chance i get
hip location and atmosphere
and the food was above_average as well
veggie pakoras were outstanding
and i loved the red chili chutney that is served alongside the mint and tamarind
northern indian entrees were rather good
but the dosai were very average
sambar was watery and low in flavor
it was the surprisingly pleasant facade that brought us to india_palace on a sunday evening
as we drove through the parking_lot
we were stunned to see how busy it was
the private lot was packed and we took the last parking space
there were still cars coming in as we walked into the restaurant
could there be private event
as i took a quick peek in
it didn't seem like it was closed for a party
we took the last of the two tables available
which was our luck since the rest of our dinner there was a large_group of people waiting
checking out our fellow diners
and we were surrounded by indians and non indians
this place was was ridiculously busy
as a result
it took awhile to get our orders in and for our food to come
it looked like a new restaurant inside with the simple decorations and complementing paint choices
as other yelper mentioned
they just renovated
a lone tv behind the bar showed bollywood videos throughout the meal
they also have two smaller rooms off to the sides
the husband and i both ordered a mango_lassi
sweet yogurt based shake made with mango pulp
to start and it was probably one of the best i've had
presented in a copper cup
i would say they give you more than other places do
we both chose a dinner special
which comes with chicken or dal soup
choice of bread plain_naan
garlic_naan
or roti
basmatic rice and mango_custard
the dal soup
a traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils
was simple
but tasty
a nice start to our meal
the garlic_naan was a generous amount
and we actually had leftovers
it was tasty with lots of garlic
my vegetable dinner special included
saag_paneer
navratan korma
dal_makhani
raita
the saag_paneer
creamy spicy spinach with chunks of homemade cheese
is usually a favorite of the husband's
so i let him have most of it
it was good
but not my favorite
the navratan korma
mixed veggies with cheese in a creamy sauce with cashews
almonds raisins
was a favorite though
probably because i love creamy sauces in indian cooking
the dal_makhani
lentil delicacy flavored with onions
tomatoes
ginger
garlic cream
was also very good as well
because i love lentils and cream
the raita
yogurt seasoned with cumin
cucumber
tomatoes mint
has never been something i could enjoy
so the husband enjoyed most of it
the husband went for the rack of lamb dinner special
rack of lamb
malai_kofta
aloo matar
the malai_kofta
cheese vegetable balls in an aromatic gravy
was a bit interesting
as we would say
it's considered a
house favorite
but it was just a bit weird for us
the aloo matar
green peas cooked with diced potatoes and aromatic spices in a curry_sauce
was yummy
as most indian curry dishes are
the rack of lamb was also good
and loaded with tons of onions and bell peppers
which the husband ate up
the mango_custard was a light simple liquid custard drink with chunks of fruit in it
not exactly what i call a custard
but more like a thicker lassi
service was okay when our waiter finally took our order
the food took awhile and our bill took awhile too
the women serving the food could use a little brush up on how to clear a table
simple things like clearing the soup bowls before bringing out the other food might help a bit
we were seated at a small table
so it was crowded with all our mini dishes
overall
india_palace served up some good indian food
in general
i love the intense spices used in indian cooking
and you definitely get it here
i can't say how authentic it is
but from the many indians eating there
i take that as a good sign
it is a bit pricey though compared_to_other indian_restaurants
i would be giving this place a but they really really irritated me
ok so all that aside
the selection is good the atmosphere is good
the two times i have eaten there the food was imo overly salty but not enough to keep me away
now the third time i go in there
they were down right rude
there was no one in there and we asked if we could sit in the little room by the windows
yes we asked politely and were answered by
no
sit here
points to dark dark corner by some older lady who seemed to be having a bad day
i responded by gently telling her we did not want to sit in the dark corner and we wanted to read a bit while we ate so
we asked again if there was anyway we could sit here or is there some reason we can't
no
sit here
points to dark dark corner
oh man so i stood there a second wondering if maybe we were having a language barrier issue and this nice old lady wasn't intentionally being rude
so i look to the young man who was holding the ice water pitcher
he looked like the woman scared him hitless and he pretty much tried to usher us to the dark seats
oh man
so i turn to my girlfriend and we both walk right back out the door
we went to india_oven down on sahara and las_vegas blvd
instead
and yes they have good food and good service
they even let us in before they were really open for the lunch buffet
well
i had tried origin india
tamba
bollywood grill
and india_oven
none of them compare to the tastes of india_palace that i experienced in oct
everything tasted great
from the mango_lassi to the chicken_tikka_masala
the only negative was that the waiter's indian accent was very thick and he tended to speak quickly
so he wasn't always easy to understand even for a well traveled person like myself
still
i'm yet to find a better indian restaurant in las_vegas
i dropped in with a buddy for the lunch buffet
it was ok
the fare is standard for an indian place
lamb_curry
chicken_tikka_masala
naan_bread
here's a tip if you offer a buffet
don't bother offering salad if all you're going to have is iceburg lettuce and canned fruit
i'm glad they honored the coupon for the buffet
and the service was polite and good
terrible service but good food
pretty pricy for curry
if you wanna see the most unfriendly servers
this is the place to go
i will_never_go_back there
tho
last_night in vegas
my girlfriend and i wanted to eat somewhere off the strip and have some good indian food
we are both glad we found this place
ok it may not be in the best part_of_town
but the food more than makes_up_for_it
appetizers
complimentary flat breads with dipping_sauces
entrees
lamb_curry chicken_tikka_masala
sides
keemon naan and plain_naan
everything was oh so good
i don't really eat too much indian food
maybe because i'm worried that i'm going to get bad indian food
but i'm glad we went here
first thing you notice when you walk in
is that everyone that is sitting in the restaurant is indian
ok
so they're all indian this place must be good
and yes it was
for sure we are going to have to go back here again if and when we are in vegas
wife and i tried the lunch buffet at india_palace and found it to be ok
but unremarkable and a little under spiced
the restaurant is rather pleasant compared to some of the strip_mall establishments that vegas indian places can be
but i just didn't have my socks blown off enough for a repeat visit or to want to sample the dinner menu
sunday_night
january
indian food heaven
my bf yelped this place while we were thinking of a place to grub my last_night in vegas before heading back home monday morning
when we first walked in
i thought
wow
tons of indian customers and wow
very classy spot
we started_off_with some flat breads and a couple different dipping_sauces
very delicious
for our entrees we ordered the chicken_tikka_masala and the lamb_curry and of course being total mcfatties we ordered different_types_of naan_bread
ohhhh how i love naan and ohhhh how they made them just right
and to finish off with dessert we ordered some indian ice_cream
i had the pistachio and he ordered the mango
very different
but very good as well
the service was also quite excellent
i definitely didn't think we'd find an awesome indian restaurant as this one that night
definitely gotta try this place out if you're ever in vegas and looking to dine off the strip
i'm a huge_fan_of this place
wonderful
wonderful indian food
i've eaten here four times in the last months and each time everything's been terrific
highly
highly_recommend
so
diamond palace in diamond bar
ca had the best chicken_tikka_masala as of yet
well
i have finally discovered
so far
the winner of that title
it now belongs to india_palace in las_vegas
nv
it is located a mile east of the strip
the neighborhood seems run down but the restaurant is beautfully decorated and modern looking
the flavours of the chicken_tikka_masala were perfect
i ordered mine spicy and it had just_the_right_amount_of kick
it was unanimous within our group of indian food lovers that this was the best place we've had yet
the waiter recommended the rice dish pea pulao
which contained white basmati_rice
peas
yellow raisins
and either peanuts or cashews
can't remember
he said it was more special and flavorful than the regular rice
it was good also
but i prefer the plain rice
the naan was perfect as well
but who could mess that up
i am sad that it is so far away because i can't eat it often
but luckily i visit las_vegas a few times a year and it will make it that much more special to anticipate eating it
i will never hit the casino buffets anymore and opt to go to india palace's buffet instead
now that's money well spent
zagat rated pretty much indicates that a restaurant is quite excellent
and they're correct with this place
best_indian_food_in_vegas so far
the only place that i know of that knocks this place out of the map would be curry in a hurry back in ny
but
this place will do
unless i visit ny again
go for buffet during lunch
great price and selection
best indian lunch buffet in a town where the indian_lunch_buffets i've tried aren't particularly fantastic
no comments on any non buffet action as i haven't had it
located right near the convention center for all of you out of towners
but also not in a particularly good neighborhood the further you head away from the strip
still though
if you're in that area of town it's a pretty good meal
their_lunch_buffet is nice
their north_indian dishes are really really good
good ambience
the dosa is also nice but huge
basic veggies like okra are just ok
but the paneer and cholle etc are really nice
if it were in my hands i would give this place negative ratings
i am an india and i have been to all sort of indian_restaurants in us and in india
so let me start my part of experience here
me and my friends went here reading all the nice yelp_reviews
we ordered some appetizers
some sabji
naan and mysore masala_dosa
the waiter took our order and asked us if we want the sabji spicy or medium spicy
we said medium spicy would be good
so he brings everything from started to the sabji and naan in order
the starters were okay and sabji was totally bland
we could easily say
since i have some cooking experience
that the mixed_vegetable sabji was made out of frozen ready made cut vegetables
partially cooked and lacking all the spices that make it indian
but we did not complain because we thought that it might be because we said medium spicy
so
after we all but my poor friend who had ordered the dosa
were done with our lunch
they bring the dosa
the sambhar is sour like lemonade
we did not complain_about it
but the mysore dosa is full of red chilli powder
she
could barely eat two pieces of it
so
we call the waiter and tell him that we find it to spicy
he starts explaining us that we don't know what an actual mysore masala tastes like
and tells us that since we have not eaten an actual mysore masala in the city of mysore in india we cannot complain_about it
so
i informed him that i am from india and i have eaten mysore masala for more than years and yes in mysore too and its never this spicy
he made faces and so i told_him that its their mistake because they should have mentioned that it is very spicy in their menu
so
he got a bit scared and offered us some complimentary dessert
which we obviously denied and left the place paying for everything
with bad taste in our mouth
wow
the renovation has really improved the ambiance of this place
great job
so much more open
with a lot more space
some good bollywood videos on the tv
low lighting
nice
anyway
the lunch buffet
has several vegan_options
one of which is masala_dosa
i know
you're freaking out
you have been looking for an indian place that even serves dosa
much less has it on the buffet
well
this is a blessing and a curse
masala_dosa should be eaten immediately after it comes off the griddle
which does not happen at a buffet
but if you can hold out til you see a fresh batch brought out
it's pretty good
and the sambar to go with was super tasty
bad news though
their coconut_chutney has dairy in it
the server was very helpful pointing out the vegan friendly dishes
pakora
rice
chana_masala
cabbage
dosa
sambar
some salad stuff
they will also bring you
vegan
roti upon request instead of naan
it's an a ok place
a nice change of pace from the usual trip across_the_street to mint
oh
and meat_eaters apparently you must try the meatballs and the goat
that was the word around the table
can't confirm personally
i've been to india_palace a number of times now and would say it's one of my favorite indian_restaurants in las_vegas
the neighborhood is a little sketchy
but don't let that fool you
this place is worth it
a few people i know used to not like this place because it was really dumpy
i never saw how it used to look
but the place was renovated a couple years_ago and is quite nice now
even the people who used to not like going there have returned
the menu_items are typical of what you will find at most indian_restaurants
however
they have a number of southern_indian foods that i was not familiar with
one dish
the dosa
is something i would highly_recommend to anyone
essentially
it is a gigantic crepe filled with ground potato and onion
to give you an idea of the size
it's probably about inches long
inches wide
and an inch thick
if you want to make it amazing
you can ask them to include ground lamb
it's not on the menu
but for an extra few bucks
it's overwhelmingly worth it
it comes with two sauces
sambar and coconut_chutney
i've never cared much for coconut
but everyone_else always thinks they go well together
paired with their naan varieties
you really can't lose
the tandoori
masala
and everything else i've tried has been very good
additionally
they have a lunch buffet for about that's worth checking out
overall
if_you_are_looking for good indian
this is somewhere you need to go
it's a rather sad thing that i don't frequent indian_restaurants
being ethnically indian
i should be galloping to the nearest indian place to gorge on the curries and breads but i never do
the first reason is that for the most part
the indian_buffets or restaurants leave me with a very uneasy stomach
the second reason is that a lot of indian_restaurants leave something to be desired in the hygiene department
i'm happy to say that india_palace has somewhat alleviated my prejudices against indian_restaurants
esp the ones in las_vegas
we went on a sunday_afternoon
they serve a lunch buffet
bucks
every day
the restaurant was packed
and it was quite well decorated
muted romantic colors
nice lighting
wow
a refreshing change from the usual indian buffet experience
one of my friends' went for the buffet which had about dishes and a multitude of salads
yogurt dipping_sauces and deserts
my husband has partaken in the buffet before and both of them had only good things to say about the buffet
as i was feeling not too hungry
i decided to have something from their dosa menu
i ordered an onion and chili oothapam
thick pancake made from fermented idli dosa batter
the batter needs to have a distinct sour taste and it is topped generously with onion veggies or whatever you fancy
this was served with a sambar and coconut_chutney
the oothapam itself was pretty good and the sambar although definitely not authentic traditional south_indian sambar
certainly tasted good
my friend had a paper dosa which was crisp and tasty and my husband had the mysore masala_dosa
dosa stuffed with a spicy potato masala with some spicy chutney in it
i was pretty stoked to eat south_indian dosas in vegas and have it taste good and be seated in a relatively nice establishment
the service was a bit crazy
they had about waiters waitresses and no one was wearing any sort of uniform
all the wait_staff were indian and so were the customers
imagine my confusion and uncertainty when calling for service
my husband also had the chai and said it was really good
he didn't leave any for me to try so i'd have to take his word for it
i ordered coffee
although not the traditional filter coffee served in south_india
the combination of the coffee and dosa made for a very satisfying lunch
i'd definitely go back for their dosa offerings
the vegetarian_dishes was okay
i did enjoy the cabbage dish and i believe it is called kutu
anyway
it was fresh and tasty
the vegetables was cooked_perfectly right
not too soggy and still had a fresh crisp at each bite
i didn't eat as much
but i was extremely full right away
i wonder if the myth about buffets is true
you know
the myth of putting something in all of the food that makes you full fast so you don't eat as much and waste any food
well
my stomach seems to think that the buffet myth applies to india_palace
it feels like i ate a whole roast pig
i just feel awkwardly bloated and full from eating a few vegetarian_dishes
i am not sure if i would come back
considering that the lunch buffet is
the waiter also had poor listening skills
the bill was
my friend had cash and i had a card
we told the waiter to bring back in change and put the rest on the card
simple enough right
he put into the bill and charged
on the card
ay yay yay
i had a hankering for indian food and had been meaning to try india_palace
i grabbed a friend and we headed on our way
as others have said
the neighborhood is a bit sketchy
the restaurant is nice inside and looks recently renovated
the staff was extremely friendly and seated us right away
the food is good
really good
they immediately brought us papadum and a few various sauces
we ordered some garlic_naan
delicious
and the bombay fish
decent
we ordered chicken_tikka_masala and reshami chicken along with two orders of basmati_rice
i ordered the tikka masala as spicy as they make it
it was spicy but
i wanted tears and didn't get any
it was still delicious
it's the best indian food i've had in las_vegas during the years i've lived here
great service
great atmosphere
and great food
go
this is the nd best indian food ever
we've been to the middle east and had true indian food and experienced the full cultural effect
anyhow
we live in orange county
ca
and eat here every time we come to vegas
which is pretty often
we've tried numerous places close_to_home and have found nothing that comes even close to india_palace
we always leaving enjoying the food of other establishments since we love indian food but it always feels like something is lacking
we always get the same items
papadum served with various sauces you get this for free right when you sit_down
garlic_naan
chicken_tikka it's all white_meat with onions and peppers
chicken_vindaloo extra
indian
spicy
peas pulao
simple
easy and delish
the place is clean and the service is warm and friendly without being overbearing
my friend and i called ahead to see if they had a lunch buffet on sunday
the person who answered the phone was prompt and courteous
he confirmed that they had a sunday buffet for
i asked if there were any vegetarian_dishes
he said yes
and then rattled off a half a dozen of them off the top of his head
great
we're on our way
this place is located just off of the strip don't walk it though
it seems to cater to locals and adventurous tourists and california visitors looking for good indian food
like me
the area is a little run down
definitely not the pride of vegas
buffets are common in this town
even in off strip restaurants
where even all_you_can_eat sushi is the norm
india_palace has been completely remodeled inside and out since i was last there a few years_ago
i think that even the assphalt parking_lot was new
the new space is awesome inside
it's very nice and well appointed
trendy
somewhat techno indian music adds to a well designed layout with dark wood tables
cozy booths
and a nice central bar area
the lunch buffet was great
lots of veggie stuff to choose from
little to no vegan though hard_to_find with indian food since ghee and cream are staples
they also must be paying attention to some yelpers since the service was great
the service was fast and friendly and hot naan hit our table about as fast as it takes to cook it
and
yes
you can get the matriarch to smile when you smile at her and compliment her naan
which was fantastic
we'll_definitely_be_back
nice decor and very clean
the servers need to take some training on etiquette
but they didn't mean bad
the chicken_tikka_masala was tasty for sure but a small portion for the money
goat biryami was bad
gulab jun was yummy
let me start by saying
this was my first time having indian food
i was a little worried because i'm not too sure i like curry
didn't think i would like indian food
but my mother in law wanted to do the lunch buffet for her birthday
she and her husband spent a year and a half in india
wow
with the exception of some chick_pea salad thing
i liked everything on the buffet
and i basically tried everyting
the chicken_tikka_marsala or
butter_chicken
was so yum
my mom in law called around trying to find a lunch buffet with this dish and only india_palace had it
so score
i also really liked the spinach
not sure what was in it
but it had a spicy kick
there were also these vegetable fritter things which were great
sorry
i can't be more descriptive
but i was overwhelmed
the service was great
i believe the owner was waiting on us and he talked to the in laws about india and really made it a good experience
cute decor
parking is tight
overall
i would_definitely_recommend_this_place
this review is for their_lunch_buffet
i was so lucky today
the buffet had my favorite entree and dessert
all for about
which normally would have cost me close to easily
goat karahi
the meat was so tender and flavorful
place a piece of this delicate meat on a piece_of_naan
add some white onions and a squeeze of lemon
what do you get
yummy yummy in my tummy
kheer
traditional rice_pudding made with basmati_rice
milk
sugar saffron
i can eat bowls of this easily
so delicious
they constantly bring out naan to you when your basket gets low
aside from these awesome things that i eat from the buffet line
they also offer other dishes like the pakora
aloo_gobi
chicken tandoori
and many other dishes and desserts
my friend had mango_custard and she said it was very good
i vowed to try it next time by not overstuffing myself with the kheer
their menu changes though
the other time that i was here
instead of the goat karahi
they had lamb_vindaloo
instead of kheer
they had gulab_jamun
milk cheese balls soaked in a honey syrup
which was a sad day for me
i expressed to the server with a pout
indicating that i would much prefer the kheer
next thing you know
he brought out a serving of kheer just for me
yay to the awesome server
therefore
if there are certain items that you like
you might want to call ahead to check out what's on their line
other than that
if you feel adventurous
please check_this_place_out
i will definitely come back
went for the lunch buffet and came away very pleased
with the exception of the crazy lady seated behind us rambling and talking_about weird
crazy shit
the food was fresh
tasty and we enjoyed many of the different dishes we tried
it's been a long day and i can't remember exactly what we had by name but we'll definitely_be_going_back
the tikka masala was great
yum
yum
and yum
the garlic_naan is to die for
i had the chicken_tikka_masala and it was absolutely_delicious
last sunday i took a friend from oregon to india_palace
i've been there many times and each time is as good or better than the last
the renovations make it quite lovely inside used to be pretty drab
we had the buffet and i had honestly forgotten how much it cost so was pretty surprised to get the bill
under for two
the rogan_josh is out_of_this_world
but everything on the buffet is delicious
the flavors are wonderfully blended and some of the dishes are moderately spicy but not hot hot
the naan is included which
as you may know
can add quite a bit to the cost of your meal if you order from the menu
i've been to several other indian_restaurants in las_vegas and india_palace has never disappointed
my friend was suitably impressed and is looking_forward to going there again on her next visit
and am i being anti pc to say that we were the only non indians in the restaurant that afternoon
that speaks well of the place
oh and if you have an entertainment book
there is a coupon although it's not good for the buffet
but at
who needs a coupon
india_palace has been voted best indian restaurant in las_vegas by the zagat survey every year since and it has been described to me by indians as the most authentic restaurant we have
i've dined there a handful of times to see if i agree
although i wouldn't normally want to hang out on east twain
one of the city's most dangerous areas
i will always take unnecessary risks for good food
the restaurant sticks out as the only kept up
interesting piece of architecture in that area
so it's hard to miss
you will forget about the exterior surroundings upon entering as the decor is immediately welcoming
the walls are painted in warm
cheery earth tones that are beautifully complemented by heavy amber drapes and rich
dark woods
there is a comfortable full service bar you can enjoy a drink at before your meal
making india_palace stand out from many of its competitors
my favorite thing to get here is the dosa
a thin pancake made from chickpeas
it is of such great diameter that it must be folded upon itself so it can almost fit on your plate
and it is eaten by tearing off more reasonably sized pieces
the only other place i've seen dosa is at india_masala in the riviera
same owners
i believe
so i highly_recommend ordering it here
you can have your dosa stuffed with an incendiary potato filling
or get the plain papper dosa
which i prefer
both
it is served with an addictive coconut 'chutney
' which is more like a coconut puree
and sambar
a tangy tamarind based soup dip
even without the accompaniments
the dosa serves as a fantastic vehicle for eating your main selections and proves to be an interesting alternative to naan
the chicken_tikka_masala
and mushroom matar
are fantastic
but i think the chef's abilities stand out most in the lamb_rogan_josh
the tomato broth is reminiscent of an authentic
slow cooked italian marinara that has been spiked with exotic spices
and the flavors continuously evolve in_your_mouth
revealing the sauce's complexity
the lamb is perfectly tender to boot
and hasn't a hint of the gaminess that can come with lower quality cuts
so
is india_palace the best indian restaurant in town
i can't affirmatively say yes
i had a spinach soup that was inedible and they don't use many fresh veggies in their_lunch_buffet
but it is definitely a contender
finally after several years of going to lunch at another nearby indian restaurant we tried india_palace
what took us so long
yeah
the neighborhood
i would be pleased if they hired some armed soldiers with
enfield rifles to stand at the doorway and of course in traditional_indian army garb
just kidding
but that is a part of las_vegas that isn't a place to walk through at any time of day
what really surprised us was the immediate sense of peace and luxury when you stepped inside
what the hec
are we in the bellagio off east twain
felt_like stepping into a ford pinto and on the inside it's a ferrari
although we've been dining on indian_fare for many years
we still don't know the proper names of all the different foods
yeah sag is spinach
naan is the bread and so on
but what we do know is that the food here at the lunch buffet at india_palace is probably the best we've ever tried in so
nevada
the flavors were all a step above the competition
service was attentive and friendly
the buffet line is a bit shorter in length than the competition
but the overall quality far exceeds quanity
naan_bread is brought to your table fresh and not in cold piles in the buffet line
overall a great experience and we have been converted
i'll even overlook the overly engergetic bollywood videos they play behind the bar
oh yes
i like samosas
but no one seems to have it available very often
i do miss those
since our last visit approximately years_ago
the restaurant has undergone a complete makeover so the dining_room is quite nice though the immediate area surrounding the restaurant remains depressed
we did not require our reservation as the dining_room was empty
shortly_after being seated we were served complimentary papadum and chutney sauces
we decided to share orders of garlic_naan
chicken_tika_masala
basmati_rice and lamb sagwala
the flavor and spice_level of each dish proved to be too tame for my taste_buds
we got the rack of lamb dinner without knowing that it was enough for two people
we also ordered this masala_dosa or whatever you call it
a huge crepe looking thing stuffed with potatoes and onions
the lamb was delicious
and the rest of the food was just ok
i am curious about their_lunch_buffet probably would go try it sometime
but don't think i will be back for dinner
i'd give this more of a
it's las_vegas
so i guess you should expect_to_pay las_vegas prices
i've had dosas in california and in asia
and would give this a for flavor
that's why we came to this restaurant for the paper dosas
we also had the malai_kofta
and that was better
naan was solid and so was the basmati_rice
service was great
i've been all around the world eating indian food
especially
dosas
their dosas are mediocre
they're supposed to have a crunch to them
however
theirs came collapsed and slightly cold
the malai_kofta we ordered was a touch bland
now the tragedy
they charge for a small bowel of basmati_rice
i've never heard of ordering curry without a serving of rice
what a rip off
so bottomline is that you get mediocre food for a terrible price
i would not go back
went to the lunch buffet
very yummy
unfortunately they didn't have the chana_masala
which i heard was very good
so i plan to go back and try that
i had a mango_lassi
it was creamy and delicious
complemented the flavors of the food nicely
and the service was super friendly_and_attentive
great decor too
our favorite indian food in las_vegas near the strip and unlv campus
sure
it's kind of in a sketch area
but the building is nice and once inside
the decor and food are just great
they play bollywood movies or clips on the tvs and it's fun to watch while waiting for our food
tonight our party of was really hungry so we ordered our staples
vegetable_samosas
for
garlic_naan
basmati_rice
matar paneer
and dishes we haven't had before
house special lamb_rogan_josh
full tandoori_chicken
and chicken_vindaloo
we're wimps so everything was
mild
spicy but still very flavorful and delicious
with plenty of leftovers to take home
i like to try different things on the menu each time we're here
but would definitely order the lamb dish again fantastic flavor and tender
i only wish i had room for dessert when i eat here
i always come here with a coupon to make the meal an even better deal
ended_up being person including tax
and the waiter always have to be reminded to take the discount
but i've always had good attentive service and great food here and that's why we keep_coming_back
india_palace is an excellent alternative to nearby buffets on the strip
and
generally speaking
far less expensive
for about
you get a solid variety of popular indian dishes
chicken_tikka
tandoori
veggie_korma
dosas
basmati
naan
salad
and desserts
to name a few
which all taste pretty good
i have had indian food all over the world
so that's a definite compliment from me
although the place was pretty clean and had decent decor
the service leaves some room for improvement
the location is also a bit seedy
but understandable as it is on the outskirts of the strip
i also gagged when i discovered something that resembled a cockroach leg in my masala
after inspection
i'd like to give india_palace the benefit of the doubt even though i've_never_seen such a thing in the countless masala dishes i've had
but nevertheless
it totally ruined my appetite
but not enough to not give india_palace a second chance
the lack of service and room for improvement on the curries
i have had better saagar in newport beach is a comparable place and is much better
led me to give out of stars
great food
being that i'm indian and have had my fair share of indian food over the years
the staff is friendly enough
no real quips there
they did take a while after dropping off the check to come back and pick_it_up
but nothing major
water was filled constantly which was good
the one star taken off was for parking
there are very few spots and its kinda weird trying to get out as you drive around back and through the trash area if you park on the side
but nothing major
still worth checking out
we bought a groupon to india_palace and decided to use it last_night
we ordered goat briyani
malai_kofta
garlic_naan
and mango_lassi
the meal started with the typical papadum and chutneys
the tamarind_chutney was pretty decent
i'm not a big_fan of tamarind
but this was better than the tamarind chutneys i've tried elsewhere
the mint_chutney was also pretty good
they also had a pepper chutney which had a nice kick
my wife thought the mango_lassi was almost as great as at her favorite indian restaurant
the garlic_naan was good
not too burnt or chewy which i've found to be the case at many indian_restaurants
the goat briyani was really good
it had a nice mix of flavors and textures
my wife really liked it until i told her it was goat
she doesn't like goat and i ordered it while she wasn't listening
the briyani came with raita which was decent
the malai_kofta was also enjoyable
the sauce was very flavorful and the
vegetable meatballs
had a nice texture
the service was pretty slow
but overall it was a good experience
and i think i'll probably be back
really good lunch buffet
they had all my favorites
and were careful about keeping the vegetarian stuff and meat stuff separate
the ambiance here is very nice
the only reason i am giving four and not five_stars is the location
it seemed very scary
even in the middle of the afternoon
i would not come here at night
especially not by myself
it's a shame such a nice place is in such a shady neighborhood
i've tried a few indian places during various trips to vegas
and i must say this was the best food for sure
the people working here are also very nice
overall this was a good experience and i suggest trying this restaurant
every indian in las_vegas eats here
if you're not indian and you want to eat where the indians eat
this is it
it's the bomb
and i don't mean bay
everyplace else is like the toilet that kid hid in in the movie slumdog compared to this
great service
and delicious food
always seems to be plenty of staff on hand and your glass hardly ever gets below half full
the neighborhood isn't the best
but india_palace is worth going out of your way for
my favorite indian place in town
we visited on a random reco in january and were a bit sketchy because of the neighborhood
you have to call a cab for pickup
but we live in la where usually the best restaurants are in a weird strip_mall
the wait_staff was terrific in recommending a bunch of options
we are vegetarians so we just asked what the house specialties were and had a fantastic set of different dishes
we did hear another couple raving about some of the meat options so i bet those are stellar as well
prices were very reasonable and it was only a cab ride from city center
the staff_was_very_friendly and we're going back the next time we're in vegas
i stopped today to try the lunch buffet
what a great idea it was and thanks to my fellow yelpers for their reviews that helped me make my decision
the restaurant was almost empty when i arrived at
service was excellent and i know it would have been even if there were a lot of people there
while i was looking the buffet over
the waiter brought me an iced_tea as requested
shortly_after returning to the table
another server brought me a basket of fresh naan
here's what i tried
vegetable_pakora good but not a lot of spice
goat_curry nice spice and very tasty
saag_paneer with cheese flavorful with a nice zing
basmati_rice standard
naan plain and good
chana_masala excellent with a nice spiciness
bhindi_masala this was noted as a house favorite
i didn't think there was anything special about the okra nor the potatoes and it lacked much flavor
navratan lorna good
karahi lamb nice flavor and good spice
chicken_tikka_masala excellent
ras malai excellent sweet to end this feast
lest you worry that i cleaned the place out
let me assure you i didn't
i took small portions of all these things just to try them
since i was alone
i had a great time watching the bollywood bang bang music_videos on their tv screens
i'm anxious to come back for a relaxed dinner with friends and enjoy being served and trying some things on the evening menu that don't show on the buffet
i visit las_vegas about times a year
and am always looking for unique restaurants
recently while visiting
i happened to ask my cab driver where i might find some good indian food
and he directed me to this quaint restaurant called india_palace
their address is at east twain ave
in las_vegas
it's located just off the strip
east of the wynn casino
the host of the restaurant was surjit
he was so pleasant
charming
and informative of the different dishes
each dish was a unique treat for me
i wanted to share this information because not many tourist would be aware of this restaurant since it's not on the strip
this was quite a delightful experience for me both in the food and with the charming host
surjit
this restaurant is definitely worth trying
went here to support a friend's event and stayed for dinner
the staff was very customer oriented and kept our glasses of water full and were checking in on a regular_basis
i tried the bhel_puri chana chat which is chick_peas
puffed rice
onions
and potatoes tossed in a tangy tamarind_sauce
this was very fresh
my friend tried the fish tikka which was also very good
i also tried
dal_makhani pretty good
malai_kofta yummy
bhindi_masala it was good but very oily
naan both the garlic and plain_naan very light and good
gulab_jamun yummy
this was very fluffy
not how gulab jamuns usually are so this was a pleasant change
i was told that the chilli chicken was good too
i would go and check_this_place_out again
have been here thrice
always for their_lunch_buffet
the price is decent and the food is awesome
their food is not too oily and they bring really fresh bread to your table
the ambience and the music is a nice_touch too
the mango pudding is so freaking delicious it takes you straight to heaven
very nice indian restaurant
the food is fairly priced and amazing in quality
best lamb_chops and chicken_tikka_masala by far in vegas
now this place has an awesome buffet
i was totally disappointed with las_vegas indian resturants and then made it to this one on the last day of our trip
can't say enough about this place
the food was delicious
fresh
with enough variety and each dish was a pleasure to taste
the decor was nice and indian and even the restrooms were clean
very satisfied
highly_recommend
it was only okay to me
i had better indian food
customer_service was very good though
for las_vegas standards
this is fantastic indian dining establishment
the food is fresh and very tasty
the saag_paneer is subperb and the price is just right for the lunch buffet
and no lunch would be complete without a bit of bollywood in the background
the food was very good
and i highly_recommend mixing and sharing some dishes with those you come with
however
i must say that our server pressured us a lot
and made our eating experience very uncomfortable
for that reason
i don't see myself returning for another visit
i love india_palace
it's located in a not so prime location but once you enter the restaurant
you forget what the exterior is like
the atmosphere has an elegant feel to it but doesn't require a person dining to be dressed up
the servers are all friendly and are very good at checking up on their patrons
their food is delicious
i have tried their chicken_tikka_masala
chicken saag
lamb saagwala
goat_curry
lamb briyani
samosas
and their naan_bread
garlic is my favorite
and they were all so awesomely delish
don't forget to order a side a mango_lassi cause theirs is definitely one the best in the valley
what an awesome place
ricky was awesome
owner was fantastic
we will be back for sure
the food was really good
the place was clean and the staff was very attentive
i couldn't leave sin city without an indian dinner
there are no indian spots that i'm aware of in henderson but the logistics of my visit had me spend the last_night a few blocks east of the strip putting me in close proximity to several spots
i chose ip since it was the closest and with car rental already returned i was walking it
plus of my options it had the highest rating
i had the lamb_rogan_josh which the menu describes as
kashmiri delicacy cooked with intensely hot fragrant spices
which it was but it did not compete well with the lrj i had in philly
i did have something called 'temrin sauce' with the very thin wafer type cracker not naan but if you've eaten indian you know what my brain doesn't but the temrin sauce was a treat t remember
the goin out the door on ip is
i'm looking for a repeat of my lrj experience in philly and it could be ip's is more authentic and i'm simply duh
there was a presence of indian clientele so perhaps i am more duh then ip is in authenticity
when i'm in these parts again i will give ip a try again
india_palace had catered a wedding at my work a month ago
seeing the satisfaction of the native diners drew me to try this place out
i had originally wanted to use my groupon
but that offer cannot be combined with the lunch buffet
instead
i opted for my sister to try some new dishes and determine new favorites
no fear about the unused groupon
next time i will return for dinner
although i might have failed with my initial mission
the free_mango_lassi for my first check in made up for it
the yogurt drink was a nice balance of tart and sweet
really refreshing for the muggy weather we have been experiencing
with the fourth of july over
and done with
my meat intake had thrown me off balance
to offset the bbq
no cuisine is better than indian for when you feel like dining on good vegetarian friendly dishes
did i choose to stay completely meat free
no
i could not resist a few pieces of goat in a curry_sauce
a piece of tandoori_chicken
and some chicken_vindaloo
all of these dishes were fantastic
nothing was overly salty or sweet
instead they had strong herbal or spice accents that did not mask the meat
the cilantro chutney only intensified the sensations within my mouth
now for the real reason why i love indian food
the paag paneer was addictive and tasted wonderful with the fresh garlic_naan
nice pieces of cottage_cheese were found throughout the creamy spinach mixture
the dhal curry was also a favorite
the complex spices in this yellow lentil soup is great over rice
or just eaten straight
do not forget to help yourself to some kheer
this creamy rice_pudding is thinner than the kind you will find in mediterranean restaurants
but has slivers of almonds within
the buffet is open from
for a reasonable
india_palace is the best indian restaurant to my taste in las_vegas
i have been going here for the past years and have not once felt the food to be unsatisfactory and only once have i found one of the staff members to be difficult
he hasn't been there for years
however
to understand the reasons why they are the best would take me the better part of a book
so with the exception of a few highlights
i will encourage you to experience this food experience for yourself altogether a more satisfying experience than reading any review
first off
since they are a ubiquitous and primary form of indian food consumption
i have to rave about their_lunch_buffet
at about
india_palace will cost you that extra dollar or two over mint
which is more nepalese
if i'm not mistaken
mt
everest or india_oven
but not even ghandi's excellent fare is close in quality and variety
every day there is a pilaf
lentils
tandoori_chicken
a saag dish
a korma
a tikka
a masala
a salad
both mango_custard and kheer
naan and sauces
raita
tamarind
mint and a few others
for a vegetarian
this is one of the best buffets for you
the break down always has at least vegetarian selections in addition to the rice and lentils most others are not nearly as diverse
for the carnivore
the selection is by no means meager at least chicken dishes plus tandoor and a lamb or goat dish
alone
the spread is great
but
having eaten here dozens of times
i have to comment that the clencher for me is the fact that i can't tell a difference in quality between the lunch food and the dinner food
this can't be said
in my opinion
of others
secondly
i find
despite the opinions of others
the dinner to be reasonably_priced for the quality
if you consider that indian_restaurants are usually priced well above other non european
ethnic cuisines
it is easy to think of them as pricey
but the complexity of indian curries and the time to cook makes them cheap if you compare them to a steak
also
if you consider the consistent quality of the food
india_palace is worth the extra buck you might pay over bollywood or mint
additionally
i find them to be cheaper_than tamba or origin
what can i say
i'm_a_huge_fan
went here today for the first time and left happy
i'm a relative newcomer to sin city and am always satisfied when i try a new eatery with great results
i had the lunch buffet and everything was fresh
tasty
and colourful without any nasty aftertaste
something i've experienced at other ethnic places
my favourite dishes included the goat tikka masala and the saag_paneer
the chutney was pretty good too
especially on top of the naan
for about tax
one can eat his or her fill of nicely spiced indian food that is heavy on flavour and light on the grease
both vegetarians and carnivores have plenty of options with which to fill their bellies
i plan on coming_back again soon to try the dinner menu
with a coupon from restaurant
com
off makes dinner here affordable for us every few months
for four people
we order the mixed curry dinner
and vegetarian dinner
plus an appetizer if we're still hungry
the chicken_tikka_masala is my favorite by far
and the mango pudding is a great dessert
i love the mint_chutney
but sometimes it's a little too salty
the service is always pleasant
but often too attentive with five different waiters checking on us
i didn't know they offer a lunch buffet
so i plan on checking it out soon
four people
table service
two who really know and love indian food and two who love_this_place
though i am unsure of the breadth of knowledge on the cuisine itself
service
the service was fantastic
vick really took care of us and
having waited on my friends for the past four years
exuded a certain cameraderie that really brought everyone together
he made recommendations
made sure we wanted for nothing
and kept the meal moving forward without making us feel rushed in any way
food
the food was mostly good
not great
but good
tasty enough to share amongst friends over a couple bottles of wine
and some good conversation
the paneer_pakora
cheese squares made of layers of cheese with some thin herb veggie spread in between
then battered and fried
was disappointing
maybe the squares are too big and cool off too fast
it quickly becomes a hunk of room temperature fried_cheese
it didn't make think of indian food as much as any other fried_cheese product around town
the chicken pakora was much like the cheese
it seemed like any other fried chicken strip
the flavors want to be there
but it's just not executed well enough
not impressed
the samosas were really tasty
the crusts were flaky and the stuffing was generous and flavorful
layered flavors
a great kick of spice
and the textures were good
a highlight
for sure
the sauces
mint
tamarind
and chili
were fantastic
really
really flavorful and fresh
we refilled our sauce dishes at least twice
best part of the meal
the chicken_tikka_masala was tasty
not the best in town
but tasty
we ordered one medium and one hot
the hot was truly hot
pushing the line of too much
and therefore hiding some of the flavors
still
the flavors were good and the chicken was tender
the peas pulao
basmati_rice with peas and cashews
was pretty damn good
actually
i tasted a bite with a little of everything and really loved the freshness
the combination of flavors
great complement
the breads were good
my companions had to try at least four kinds
i tasted a few small bits here and there and found them good
again
not great
but good
worth trying
cost value
the apps and bread are priced well
especially for groups who want to get a few things and share
the entrees
however
are overpriced for what we received
appetizer size at entree prices
the tikka masala was tiny for what they charge and the rice was a la_carte
also a bit pricey for what you get
bad juju there
as your
entree
becomes a dish but it's just not a place
it wasn't my dime
but for a group of four is a bit excessive for a place like this
even considering the wine
overall
food
and value of same
made me think it was a
edible
but i have had much better
but the service and atmosphere was easily a
so
a star
a ok experience
i would go again with my friends as they have a special affinity for this place
but i'll also take them somewhere_else when it's my turn to choose
food is pretty good but service is not good at all
i went for lunch and didn't order the buffett the staff acted all put out by that
and when i tried to order a dessert off the menu they said they'd check and see if they had it
it was ok but nothing special
stopped here for a quick to go order for lunch on our last day at vegas before driving to airport
got vegetable_biryani
and that was awesome
wish we had known about this place earlier
would have definitely tried the buffet and other dishes
the dinning area looked good and the hosts were very warm too
would surely visit whenever in vegas the next time
i love india_palace
best indian place to eat in my own humble opinion
but
i suggest you to try their lunch_buffets before you decide for yourself
they have goat_curry
which is total awesomeness
their garlic_naan bread is the best i've ever tasted in my entire life
they bring it out all fresh too
the staffs are super sweet
i wouldn't eat dinner there though
especially if you are a girl
this restaurant is located at a pretty shady area
if you really want to come at night
you should bring pepper spray and or a taser with you
i also wouldn't come here if you're a vegetarian
the veggie dishes taste and look boring to me
sorry
i focus on meat
parking sucks also
don't park there if they have a truck there to restock their kitchen
being the asian female driver i am
i couldn't back out my car
so
a waiter had to do it for me
yes
i know
very embarrassing
we r regulars here and we enjoy the food as always
delicious fish tandoori platter and i love the dosa
we always request for gary to serve us because he cater to our needs
thanks gary for being amazing and awesome as always
excellent with a capital x
i've been fairly content with all of the indian food i've tried in vegas
but somehow
india_palace managed to blow me away
i came in here to finally use a long standing groupon with kris j before he moved out of town
we ordered saag_paneer
navratan korma
and chicken_makhani
if you know me at all
you know that i love my butter_chicken
ip's makhani failed to disappoint
it was creamy
tender
and oh so delicious
i'm so enamored by butter_chicken
i feel like i basically ignore every other dish that the culture has to offer
i'm glad i had such an ip connoisseur with me
the paneer and korma both kris's selections were outstanding
i'm not quite sure what it is
but there's something about ip's food that just ever so slightly sets them apart from the crowd
the one weird thing about the visit
it seemed like we had five different servers waiting on us and they all lined up behind the scenes to take their turn to come over and ask if we had everything we needed
it's not a bad thing
it was just comical
i wish i had bought more groupons now
the food is awesome and the service is good
waiters were very friendly
i am disappointed in the lunch prices
i was hoping for a quick lunch with my daughter for less then bucks and the two times we went spent near
parking is also limited
i never know what i will get when i go to india_palace
will the rice be crunchy and dry
will it take the waiter minutes to give me my check after my plates are cleared
will i get stabbed
generally
the answer is no
which makes it one of the better indian spots in town
but
don't get too excited
the lunch buffet is the only reason to come here
dinner is incredibly overpriced
for a vegetarian platter is crazy
crazy
why spend for one bland dish for dinner when you can get the lunch ayce selection of bland dishes for less than
save your dinner pennies for something better this is not the best indian you will ever have
no_matter_what the review journal says
bright spots on the menu include lamb_korma
lamb in a creamy
coconuty sauce
aloo_gobi
sauteed potatoes and cauliflower
and saag_paneer
creamed spinach with homemade cheese
i also like their renovations
they've greatly improved the atmosphere
sad spots include burned naan
rather bland food
small servings of rice
with dinner entrees
and dirty looks from waiters when ordering mixed pickles and chutney
i have no_idea_what that's all about either
i'd only recommend india_palace if you happen to be driving along twain during lunchtime
interesting place
we brought a restaurant
com_coupon and there were three of us
service was
interesting
while i like attentive servers
this guy was a little too attentive
it was almost like he was another dinner guest
he was always at our table
we appreciated the suggestions he gave_us for starters but it felt a little pushy and too much like an upsell
the shahi_paneer was pretty good
that's my standard order
some kind of paneer
the kulfi was good
but not as good as mint
i may come back but there are a lot of great indian places much closer to me
so maybe not
over priced and the entrees are served in very small portions
the bf and i have been trying all the indian_lunch_buffets about town
the buffet was overall decent
the spread was fairly good with navarathan korma being the definite star
it was creamy and flavorful with crunchy veggies
a close second was the chicken_makhani as the chicken was moist
some of the other offerings were good
but other than what i mentioned
pretty standard
the service is really friendly and very attentive so major points for that
didn't need to ask for refills and plates were cleared right away
we were checked on often
i think i prefer this over the other much talked about namaste
but it cannot beat mint for me
my first time here
the restaurant itself is big and spacious but their parking_lot sucks
so make sure you're not driving a big car
i'm good at back up parking my truck but it was really difficult turning around anywhere in this mini parking_lot
the food was excellent
i had the chicken_tikka_masala and my bf had the tandoori fish
all sizzling
we also got the peas pulau rice which is rice mixed with peas
almonds and cashews
sounds weird you say
i know but man is it yummy
we also had different appetizers that are like bread stuffed potato and the other is bread stuffed with minced lamb
those smelled like yummy cheesy pizza when it came out
lol
the potato one was alright
i dig the lamb one much more
for dessert we got mango_custard and wow
it was good
pricing is somewhat expensive
all the main_dishes are about and up
my small bowl of chicken masala was
eeep
we did order a sandwich
that almost like a greek gyro
for the bf's brother in the kids menu section and for only it was a footlong
so its give and take
some dishes are expensive and some aren't
but i would_definitely_come_back here
this place was great
excellent service
large portions
great prices on alcohol and very friendly
will be back
i've been coming here for the last years and i have yet to have disappointing food or service
i agree the service can border on being overly attentive at times
everybody is warm and friendly and eager to have you as a guest
i can heartily recommend india_palace to both vegetarians and carnivores alike
i've visited with a large_group of vegetarians and there were nothing but compliments
so now the food
the thing to start with
especially with a group is the assorted naan breads
my favorites include keema which is naan with minced lamb
garlic and poori which is fried whole_wheat bread
the naan rounds out what seem to some as small portions
when you have naan
your entree of choice with the aromatic basmati_rice you have a very generous serving of food
no_matter_what you order
i recommend getting rice as a nice complement to the sauces and curries
i'm not a vegetarian
but enjoy the spices of the channa
chickpeas
masala
the goat saag in spinach and herb is delicious
the meat is so tender and juicy it can best most steaks
i can say that about the chicken and lamb as well
to top it off
india_palace serves a great selection of beers from india including hayward
taj_mahal and king fisher
i find taj_mahal the most refreshing almost sweet tasting
and it goes well if you like your food spicy
bottom_line
very attentive service
delicious variety
very tender
very juicy meats and indian beer
you can tell the ingredients are high_quality and worth the upscale price
summary
flavor probably one of my favorite india restaurants_in_town
the lamb is tender and not overcooked like other places
price portions the prices are on par with other indian_restaurants but the portions are definitely a lot smaller
locale the restaurant is located in a pretty bad neighborhood and the parking_lot is dimly lit
decor though it might not look it from the outside
the inside is quite nice
lunch buffet they have a lunch buffet for
which i think is a way better deal
moreover
i wouldn't want to be in that neighborhood at night anyway
ordered
chicken_tikka_masala creamy and delicious
this curry is a must try
lamb_rogan_josh the lamb was tender
the curry was a tomato base and wasn't as thick as other curries
garlic_naan your standard garlic_naan
fluffy and soft
cheese_naan they added cheese to regular naan
it kinda tasted like a cheese pizza
but better
recommendations
i'd definitely recommend_this_place
however
if you don't mind which meal
i'd say go to the lunch buffet for a wider selection and a way better deal
this place is solid
the food is good and a couple of hose indian beers will lay u away
the key to enjoyment is the tandoori chicken_tika
as hot as they will do it
very very good
butter_chicken
very good
nan
rockin
the owner is cool
and this place really hs great food
get anything fish
lamb
fish
tandoori
it rocks
enjoy
i have been there times
each time i come away thinking i should have started to eat indian food sooner
our server was vic
he was very helpful and friendly
this is a place i will come back to
i think the pricing is a little high
but i always come away satisfied with my evening
well
on a whim my friends and i were looking for a good place to eat and someone suggested india_palace
having heard the good reviews over the years
we decided_to_give it a try
i checked the yelp app on my phone and saw that with 'check in' on the app you get free appetizer or cocktail with purchase
the reviews were also favorable so in we went
we arrived at pm and the place was seemingly in between shifts so we were sat promptly
i noticed on signage that there were happy_hour specials until pm so i asked the hostess about them
she replied
happy_hour
why not
you can get buy get one free on appetizers
great
it was about the same as the deal on the app so we ordered
we had veggie and lamb samosas
very nice as well as a few other items including garlic_naan bread
chicken briyani
chicken mixed with basmati_rice with spices
cashews vegetables
and chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt spices
simmered in a creamy tomato sauce
pretty standard stuff
we even opted for some traditional desserts and indian beer
all in all the food was really good and tasty and i was very satisfied and full
service was a bit off
but i think that may have been due to the language barrier
and sometimes the server would suggest an item
and then bring something else
in this case he offered a couple of different beers and then brought something altogether different
it wasn't a huge deal as the beers were good and of us were sharing so they went fast
what was strange was when the bill arrived
i asked again about the happy_hour specials
as the bill had not been adjusted
our server was no where to be found and the server presenting the check had no_idea_what i was talking_about
i got up to ask the hostess that seated us about the specials
she was the one that said
why not
and she acted as though she didn't know what i was talking_about
then reluctantly adjusted the bill
the 'new' server brought over the adjusted bill and seemed pretty aggravated at me
possibly for asking about the discount
i don't know but it was not a happy presentation of the new check
we paid and left
i would go again
possibly for a buffet situation
as i wasn't completely satisfied with the service
but the food was very good
i think at least one of my friends wouldn't return due to the service
we weren't asking much but the hasty and unhappy presentation of out adjusted bill kind of put us off a bit
like i said though
we liked the food
so who knows
you should know that india_palace is on a very sketchy part of twain ave
it is literally always surrounded by police cars and as we pulled into the parking_lot of the restaurant
no less than police cars with sirens blaring were pulling guys out of a car next_door and had them pinned to the ground at gunpoint
i mention it
because i know the neighborhood well
and this has to be one of the less savory sections
i just wouldn't want a tourist to stop in and be surprised but commotions such as an arrest at gunpoint in a connecting parking_lot
happy eating
just awesome
this is my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in las_vegas
i have tried many others
but india_palace has consistently the best food
the new decor is a plus
too
favorite items include shrimp biryani
vegetable_samosas
dal makani
aloo_gobi
tandoori_chicken
and garlic_naan
they also have the best tamarind_sauce
get the rogan_josh
had dinner here with a couple of close friends
i'm glad my buddy recommended this spot because we had quite an indian feast
great food and great service
i go for the buffet and it's always a wide_selection_of food
love the chicken makhni and the fresh hot naan
lassi was a lil on the sweet side
pretty darn good indian food
service can be slow
the buffet is pretty good as well
it has gotten really expensive over the years all things considered
the neighborhood is a little bit strange too so make sure you lock your car doors
my girlfriend and i ate here tonight
we had a restaurants
com_coupon and needed to spend to get off
we started out with a bread basket with cheese
garlic and lamb naans
and onion kulcha
the lamb naan was particularly tasty
but all four were fresh
hot and flavorful
we then had the vegetable_pakora
which was like deep_fried vegetable fritters
they were nice and crispy
my girlfriend
having indian food for the first time
went with the safe choice of the chicken_tikka
just about right spice wise for her and she enjoyed the dish
i
however had the lamb pasanda
i ordered it with a spice_level of out of
it came out perfect for my spicy taste
it had a nice bite without overpowering the exotic flavorful blend_of_spices in the sauce
all in all
we loved the food
the service_was_a_bit_slow
even though there was only one other table of people when we got there
the waiter also tried to change my mind when i made my entree selection
which was a bit annoying
apparently he thought a different dish would have been better suited to me
the decorum was very nice
until you got to the tv hanging on the wall
it kind of ruined the mood set by the lighting and the paintings
price wise we got a lot of food for
enough to feed people
but we will enjoy the leftovers
i'd definitely go back
vegas has a gazillion restaurants to choose from
so the list of places that i want to visit is quite extensive
i definitely knew that wanted to go to a place that would have more locals than tourists
after running through my list and seeing the great yelp_reviews
i finally decided on india_palace
wow
i was not disappointed
started the meal off with the vegetable_pakora and the onion_bhaji
the onion_bhaji
which are onions dipped in spicy batter and then deep_fried
was amazing
it had the perfect amount of spiciness to start with
and when i felt_like upping the spice meter
i just added a little of that really hot dipping sauce
i don't know the name of that sauce
but you know
the one that burns your mouth off
i went for my usual chicken_vindaloo for my main_course
chicken_vindaloo is chicken cooked in a hot spicy sauce with diced potatoes
and of course
you can request the level of spiciness
i went for
hot
to die for
it was sooo good
it was so spicy that i started sweating while eating it
yeah
that's some good shit
i gobbled this down with some garlic_naan and cheese_naan
and was quite full
i didn't even have room for dessert
which is usually required in my book
when i checked in
i unlocked a yelp coupon code
which they pleasantly honored
the service was absolutely awesome
nice
quick
and always a smile
will_be_going_back
excellent indian food in vegas
a much more upscale place than most of the other indian_restaurants
many are mall spots
naan
korma and saag were all excellent and a little on the spicy side
i would_definitely_recommend_this_place if_you_are_looking for indian food in vegas and don't mind spending a few dollars more for better ambiance
the saag_paneer is fantastic
the spices are perfectly blended
but i was bummed they sent the appetizers
we got takeout
in a styrofoam container so everything was soggy and not that tasty
in spite of the appetizer drawback the customer_service is impeccable
i'll be back for sure
i met up with my indian friend here for the lunch buffet
if you get the tendori chicken while it's fresh it can't be beat
they have this deep_fried veggie ball that when paired with the chutnay is magicial
the naan is always fresh and amazing
the only problem is it's a buffet and most everything had been sitting out for a while
the rice was old
the chicken marsala was over salted
and the goat was still chewy with many splintered bones
kheer is amazing
but you needed to asj for gulab
if they have it you won't be dissappointed
good service
good atmosphere
average per entree
having returned from a wk trip in northern india about a month ago
i was disappointed with the food
mattar_paneer was alright the peas seemed to be the frozen kind
very sweet
chicken curry was too salty
goat rogan_josh was good
rice and garlic_naan were good
my indian coworker recommended mint i guess i'll try that one next
india_palace is the most authentic_indian_food in las_vegas
probably one of the best in us
excellent food quality
very good service
friendly_staff
esp gary and many
they remember us each time we visit
their catering is very well priced and he sends lots of food
not to mention very tasty
their best creations are chicken_tikka_masala
malai_kofta
paneer_tikka and paneer_tikka_masala
downsides food is on the pricier side
buffet could be more variety
its usually same stuff
i prefer their ala_carte
this experience has virgin all over it
the first time for real indian food
the first time at india_palace
i can say that the it was extremely pleasant
the food was very good
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
medium_spice
there was no hint of hot
but the chicken was smokey and the sauce was delicious
my husband ordered the lamb_rogan_josh
medium_spice
again
not hot
but delicious
we ordered the aloo_tikki
a side of peas pulao and garlic_naan
we left no crumbs behind
i will add
the hotest food i had that night was one of the three suaces that came with the flat_bread
the atmosphere was just right for my husband and i out for date_night
they had recently
within the last two years
renovated the place and it was nice
the neighborhood is in an older part_of_town
but close enough to the strip
although i have nothing to compare this too
i felt the need to express our satisfaction and desire to try the cuisine again and again
enjoyed service and most of the items on buffet
dosas and left more to be desired
we all enjoyed the food at india_palace
it was the best indian food we ever had
the service was also great
my girlfriend had the tandoori dinner and i had the mixed curry dinner
both had real wonderful flavors and soaked everything up with naan
we had a separate order of raita
i don't think it came with our dinner dishes
overall
we had great experience and the food was just wonderful
we would visit again when we return to vegas
the food is fantastic
the staff is attentive and polite
we had the vegetable_samosa and onion kulcha to start
followed by chicken_tikka_masala
really good
and a mushroom dish that i cant remember_the_name of but we thought it could've been a little more spicey hot for our taste
but was still good
we also had rice with peas and nuts with various spices
the dips they serve when you sit_down are tasty
one spicy hot pepper
one sweet
and the other a mint
overall everything was very tasty
and they didn't seem to use too much salt like most restaurants do
it's a bit far from where we live but will be worth_the_trip back
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
we finally got a chance to try india_palace
and it did_not_disappoint
for appetizers we had the veggie_samosas and the onion kulcha
the samosas were fantastic
the onion kulcha very good but i would probably try something else next time
we had chicken_tikka_masala and matar mushroom for entrees
both were scrumptious
the food was on the spicy side in general
which we love
funniest part of the evening was after we'd been munching on the papadums with various sauces
one of the sauces was extremely spicy
and we told the waitress hostess we'd like to have our entrees just as spicy
she looked at us and said
you're white
right
i almost fell off my chair
apparently most caucasians don't request their food spicy
all the better for us
everything was reasonably_priced and evocative of the fantastic indian restaurant we'd left behind when we moved here from new jersey
this is the best indian in vegas
hands_down
excellent
the decor is contemporary and comfortable
a bit more ventilation and more lighting would be good
it's hard to read the menu in the dark
warning
you really do come out of there smelling heavily scented with the spices
but not in a good way
unless you like wearing eau de la india afterwards
so
onto the food
veggie_samosas
the skin was a bit thick
not puffy airy like i'm used to
sambar vada
the fried lentil donut had a very thick texture
i've never this before
but i would've enjoyed it more if it tasted less dense
the sambar had a nice flavor
i don't think i could've eaten the donut without it
mom ordered the tandoori_chicken dinner
the chicken is less smoky and had less tandoori seasoning than other places
those of you used to smoky lots of seasoning will be disappointed
the white_meat was cooked_perfectly
but the dark meat was a bit underdone near the bones
the dinner came with saag_paneer
good
mixed veggies
spices didn't agree with me
something with a ginseng taste in it i don't think they pulled the sinewy parts off the snap peas
and soup
flavorless
the mango_custard never came we didn't bother to ask because we were too full
i ordered the chicken sagwala
well
for
you would expect to get more than just a few chunks of chicken
the bowl was just slightly a bit larger than the side dish of saag_paneer my mom received with her dinner
garlic_naan
good
overall
it was ok
i would go back again to try the buffet just to see if they had a dish that could out do the dinner i had
tonight was the second time my husband duncan and i ate here
it was even better than the first time
we had a great deal off of groupon that included entrees
glasses of wine and rice
we ordered an appetizer that i cant remember_the_name of but had a really good cold yogurt_sauce
and almost tasted like dessert
we ordered the okra and chicken curry both extra extra_spicy
i said i wanted to breathe fire
lol
it was perfect
the dinner actually got spicier as we ate
we also had leftovers to take home
thank you we will be back
and as a side note especially if you use
groupon
people
be sure to tip generously
recently i had been here with my family
being a south_indian we were craving for authentic south inidan food and were delighted to find this place in yelp
we were and all of us relished the food
service was great
kids especially
liked the tandoori_chicken
if it weren't for a groupon offer
i would have kept on driving by this restaurant
it's not in the greatest neighborhood
so i never would have gave it a second thought
however
i am glad we took a chance and we highly enjoyed our meal tonight
we ordered chicken_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
orders of garlic_naan
and plain_naan
both curries we flavored just right
we ordered medium
but could've have handled a bit more kick in both curries
naans were yummy as well soft and fluffy
garlic_naan just had the right amount of garlic
the place was quite busy tonight
however service was not lacking
nicely_decorated interior as well
i'd recommend_this_place if you were in the area and are in the mood for indian
lunch buffet is delicious
if samosas were on the line it would be stars
i ordered food from them on line and was shocked to find that the chicken_tikka_masala did not include rice and was
absolutely outrageous
delicious food and great company
i was visiting_vegas for a convention and was craving_indian_food
i saw on yelp that they were doing a special offer and dined here
totally_worth it
can't_wait_to_come_back
i have been to las_vegas so many times but had never come across this place until this past april
i am very happy i did
the restaurant is clean
we made it for a weekend buffet
there were many vegetarian_options
just the only complaint i would have is that the pakoras were not so fresh and the dosa was cold
but that would not stop me from returning
i found the wait_staff to be quite attentive and friendly
i would definitely return on my next trip
very good vegetarian_options for dinner and great service with easy access from the strip
nice wine_list if you don't mind buying a bottle
if you don't drink it all you can take it with
i've had many indian meals and the indian palace has great authentic food
friendly_staff
and a family atmosphere
we will back for sure
try the chicken_korma and or masala they were both uniquely spiced and ohhh sooo good
the management seems to know the formula for a good dining_experience here if_you're_looking for a decent priced
tasty indian buffet
lunch buffet
good food particularly liked the goat_curry and lentils
the naan was good too
the desert section is missing those delicious popular indian sweet meats
but their rice_pudding was decent
they told us their meats are halal
which is a huge plus for us
our experience
we arrived at
p
m
and the buffet would close at pm
but the server was friendly and quick
they were able to refill a few of the dishes for us
shortly_after
about six more people came for the buffet so the staff refilled more buffet items
if you come late
please check out the buffet first and request your favorites to be replenished
tip
i used a check in coupon from yelp and promptly received a delicious
cold mango_lassi
don't miss out
this was one of the best indian_restaurants i have even been to
certainly the best in las_vegas
the food was delicious
very friendly hosts and nice ambiance
price was just right too
glad we found this gem
highly_recommended
india_palace is my favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
my favorite dishes are the chicken_tikka_masala and the chicken_makhani
the cheese_naan and garlic_naan are also excellent
the servers are friendly_and_helpful with recommending dishes
especially our favorite server garry
we use certificates from restuarant
com every time we go to save money
great food
such great ambiance and i am a total india food foodie
if_you_are_looking for a great place to eat indian food in vegas
this is your spot
because it hits the spot trust_me
you will be glad you ate here
we frequent this place for the lunch buffet which is one of the better ones we've tried in this city
which is why they deserve a
the only downside is that this was the first time we've come here for dinner and the service was great at first but ended_up being really slow towards the later part of our meal
we waited minutes for our second order of naan
it's safe to say we will not return for dinner but will definitely come back for the lunch buffet
star for free_mango_lassi thru yelp checkin
below average food
uncleaned plates and glasses
bad service
no water was given for the first round of buffet had to ask for it
very unhappy not recommended
the guy with specs at the bar has a very bad attitude
we had ordered chicken_tikka_masala
dal_makhani and naan there
it was simply yum
daal was tooo good
the lady of the place was really nice to us
its definitely a to go place for us on our next trip to las_vegas
ah
the site of my first indian experience
i remember it fondly
it may have been almost two years_ago but the taste of curry lingers long in my soul
it was a rainy night in october of and i had a groupon half priced offer
so i grabbed a friend and went
he had tried indian previously and knew to order the garlic_naan
delicious
he ordered tikka masala
i ordered chicken sagwala
both were quite good
i ordered mine with medium_spice
it provided that great warming sensation without being too spicy
though i did need some tums shortly_after
the meal started with the aforementioned naan as well as something i can best describe as indian chips and salsa
crispy little pieces of flat_bread with three different sauces
one was very strong with the red chili flavor
one was heavy on the mint
the third i recall as being sweeter and almost fruity
all very good
i was surprised at how much food i received
i was very full afterwards
i had to walk around the boulevard mall for a while before continuing on the my next stop
see my review for hofbrauhaus
after eating at india_palace
i knew i was hooked
the flavors are intense but balanced so well
i drive by some times when in the university neighborhood and i am always tempted to stop in
i am usually short on time and cash though
in any case
the food was great when i went
the service was okay
the restaurant was clean and comfortable
a good first experience
we were in town for an event and had the chicken_tikka_masala
the samosas
the orange drink with yogurt
the garlic_naan and the fried fish
loved it all
mostly like that it was romantically lit
and the service was ok
i love trying different things
having previously lived for yrs in s california i've learned not to judge a restaurant by its neighborhood
this certainly applies with india_palace
as its twain maryland neighborhood leaves everything to be desired
yet this excellant little place has had me returning over over for yrs
seems like they've never changed their chefs
as the top_notch food quality and its uniqueness has not wavered at all
service
cleanliness and pleasantness of staff also should be praised
i wasn't super impressed with the india_palace buffet
they had a few interesting selections that i don't usually see at indian_buffets
like malai_kofta yum
and also a few things that just looked downright unappetizing
the haleem looked really
really unappetizing and my husband confirmed my suspicions when he
braver than i
gave it a try it was gross
the chutneys were weird and it was hard to track down a server when we needed a drink refill or something
the malai_kofta was tasty
though
as well as a chicken dish i sampled and i liked the inclusion of samosas on the buffet
but the gulab_jamun tasted like soap and chemicals and overall i just got a weird vibe
we won't be back
having just moved to vegas and missing my favourite indian restaurant back home
we gave india_palace a try
using a restaurants
com_coupon
we started with appetizer plate appetizers of your choice
i had a lichi martini and my hubby ordered the beer recommended by our waiter
everything was awesome
we then ordered lamb_rogan_josh and goat_curry
basmati_rice and garlic_naan
it was all sooooo good
very fresh
very flavourful
nice
clean restaurant
with lovely atmosphere and wonderful wait_staff
waiter then directed us to yelp for the coupon here
can't wait for my next craving
restaurant was nice looking inside for a small place
service was slow and it wasn't so busy
food was ok
maybe indian food is just not our thing
the mango_lassi drink was delicious at least
i have been going to india_palace for the last years
the team at india_palace even catered our wedding
the food is outstanding and i have eaten at a lot of places_in_town
the chicken_tikka_masala is the house dish that is the best
they have put a lot of money into the restaurant and it is way better than what it was a few years_ago
if you have not had indian food before then go during lunch and try and buffet
you can get a little bit of everything
it was ok
i wouldn't go to the place again though
food was awesome
but this place is kind of expensive
for a vegetarian dish
we ended_up paying for three vegetarian_dishes
garlic_naan and a side of rice
plus a mojito and a mango_lassie
i will say that their mango_lassie is a killer
loved it
but
in order not to pay so much
take advantage of yelp's deal
for
we've used it and the price came out reasonable
india_palace hit_the_spot right on the head
we had the chicken_vindaloo
garlic_naan
and lamb tikka massala
they'll ask you for the spiciness level and on scale of
we got a and it really wasn't that bad
add on the house sauces and we were stuffed and satiated
the only problem here was using the yelp_deal
for
perhaps it came at a point of confusion for the manager and waiters but it took a little bit for the deal to be honored
in the end
it was all fine
just be careful to have your voucher information and yelp_deal marked as redeemed to show them as proof
the service and food could not have been better
i love to eat
so i know
hands_down the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
total flavor
authentic
full bar
loved it
am going back
having lived in both southern and northern california
i found the food to be good but not great
stars because i know how crappy the other indian food in vegas is
stars because the service was not very good
and the manager argued with me about the bill after i claimed separate yelp offers
neither claimed they had to be used exclusively
and they took the order with no issue when i showed them the offers i was planning on using
the daals were the best part of the meal
india_palace is our favorite indian restaurant in las_vegas
the vegetable_pakoras and samosas are delicious and they make the best malai_kofta we have ever had
every dish that we have eaten there
and we have eaten there a lot
has been delicious so it makes it hard to choose just one dish
and don't forget the garlic_naan amazing
we went here for lunch last weekend during our vegas trip and what a let down this place has been
when we walked in there was no one there to direct us to the buffet or a table so we decided to just stand in line and pick_up our food after which we had to search for a table and sit ourselves down
we flagged a server and asked for water which came almost at the end of our meal
the food did not have any flavor at all and we felt that we were just stuffing our stomachs rather than enjoying a meal
the masala_dosa was uncooked
tandoori_chicken bland and i cannot even define the taste of the butter_chicken
finally we decided that you cant go wrong with dal rice but that again was under seasoned and tasteless
the sweet dish mentioned a mangao custard but it felt_like thick mango nectar that was sweetened to the point of being inedible
when the host was informed by one of our group members that the food could_have_been_better he was arrogantly told that the food is purposefully kept bland to suite the taste requirements here
well it is not about the spiciness of food but the taste that was non existent so we just decided to laugh and walk away
tried the lunch buffet this time and i was meh
okay
no much food selection but i did get to try a few new things that i liked
service sucks of course and there is one waiter that i just do not like because of his personality i guess
just seems like he doesn't give a shit but it's probably like going to a chinese place and the waitress being mean because that's just their personality
he wasn't mean or anything
just seemed like he wasn't interested in helping or that i was annoying him
i walked down here form the lvcc after a long day on the consumer electronics show floor
and was pleasantly_surprised
the naan was tasty
the navratan korma a little different than what i'm used to
but still quite yummy and the staff was attentive
wait
no
the staff was attentive until i tried to pay my bill
that bit was sort of weird
they were there just enough to perfectly take care of me but not be over bearing
until i tried to give them money
one pint off for the long time i had to try to flag someone down to give them my debit card
i'd definitely visit again but next time
may just pile some cash on the table and wander out un noticed when i'm done
the chicken_tikka_masala
and well
everything else here tastes amazing
however
i am severely allergic to cashews
and i told our server this
he said they could make the masala for me without cashews
but they forgot or something
so i had a pretty bad allergic reaction at the table that left me sick for two days
i haven't been back since because i'm scared
but if you like curry
and aren't allergic to cashews
you should definitely check_this_place_out
the first two bites of that tikka masala were
almost
to die for
great please
the food is really good
delicious
i've never been a big_fan of indian_cuisine
but my meal here was excellent
i had the lamb_rogan_josh with the peas pulao rice and a side of garlic_naan
everything was fresh and delicious
the lamb_rogan_josh in particular was very well balanced with the seasoning and the lamb was tender
one word of caution
the surrounding neighborhood is a little sketchy so be careful walking there at night
the food is really good and authentic
always consistant
if you don't like your food too spicy i would recommend less than a on the scale of
i asked for a and the food was hot
they have a loyal following in las_vegas
i believe it's one of the best places for indian in las_vegas
my other favorite in las_vegas is ghadhi
pros
chicken_korma mildly spiced chicken in a cream_sauce with cashews
almonds raisins
baingan bharta tandoor baked eggplant saut ed with herbs spices
rack of lamb baby lamb_chops marinated in yogurt spices cooked in tandoor
cons
portions are small
great place
diamond in the ruff
india_palace just doesn't stack up to the other lunch_buffets in town
the decor is nice
misti mentioned mtv india on the tv
which is really cool
the buffet selection can be more interesting than our perennial favorite
mint
and having samosa on the buffet is always nice
but the service was sketchy and the flavors felt diluted compared to mint or mt
everest
i would really love to find a truly great indian lunch buffet in town but this just isn't it
food was ok
never expect amazing food from any of the india palaces and taj mahals
there was a private party going on and the kids were running around
yelling and misbehaving
the restaurant should have closed admission to general public or have asked the private party for courtesy
service was good
food was mediocre
we went because this was the closest place and everything else had waiting
rightfully so
we always come in here for their buffet
good food and costumer service
this is a fairly small restaurant but the decor is nice and the service is friendly
their chicken_tikka massala is very good
with a great tandoori flavor on the chunks of chicken
they have a lot of traditional items on the menu as well
not just westernized dishes
when i get a craving for indian
this is the place i go
awesome indian food and service
no one loves indian food more than me
it's my chill grub when i want to just veg out and enjoy a good movie
the folks here at ip know how to do it best
i had placed my order over the phone not knowing what to expect flavor wise but following my motto of
try something new every day
once i entered inside the restaurant was jam packed which i took as a sign of great food
ricky greeted me
took down my name
asked if i had ever been there before and made me feel welcome
although i was just ordering a variety of my fav appetizers he asked if i was using any of the discounts offered thru the app
i suggested that i'd save those for a larger order and he mentioned if i do use it in the future to ask for him for any additional discounts that can be offered
also
ricky reminded_me_of my
free_mango_lassi with check in
he was very prompt with their yelp offerings and i appreciate that
after all that's how i found them
quality and flavors of the food are easily stars in my book
and i wouldn't hesitate to return in the future
the only downside is that the parking_lot is small and there were a ton of taxi cabs picking_up dropping off
space is limited but once you taste the food you'll understand why
hole_in_the_wall
establishments always turn out to be the very best
try it today
it was a great time being at india_palace
i love the food and service both
particular
gary is the guy who provide us excellent service whenever i been here with my friends
he always recommend us few things and we enjoy 'em all
thank you very much gary
we truly like your service
i strongly recommend to visit this place if you fond of indian food
great food
courteous staff
good service
i had the chicken masala dish
very flavorful
don't be afraid to ask for spicy
i'd say the food was very good and the service was excellent
they had two yelp deals going and we were able to use both of them with no problem
the chicken masala was very good
though a little on the salty side
and the chicken sagwala was also good but could have used a little more flavor
the mango_lassi and paratha were both top_notch
that said
neither of us were disappointed and i'd definitely come back here
this is my first foray into indian cooking here in las_vegas
so i have to say im very impressed with the scope of the menu as with the freshness and flavors of the dishes
service was alright
not particularly friendly but efficient none the less though there was an older woman bringing out the dishes
she was amazing
i think she may have been one of the owners
just amazingly warm and friendly
wish she was our server the whole time
the tvs and sound system were playing bollywood music_videos which was pretty fun
they do have a full bar
oh and be sure to check in
we got a free_mango_lassi
on to the dishes
chicken_tikka moist
fragrant
flavorful and oh so tender
chicken_tikka_masala big bold flavors
creamy and again insanely tender
malai_kofta similar to the chicken masala though not as spicy
balls of cheese and vegetable sitting in a thick creamy gravy
garlic_naan lightly crisp with a nice chew this complimented our dishes with the ability to scoop up the amazing sauces
basmati_rice another amazing vehicle for the more gravy laden dishes
we'll_be_back
i had been craving_indian_food for a while now so i forced my man to come with me
unfortunately
he is not a huge_fan_of indian_cuisine
we got here at
on a sunday_night and there was just other table besides us
this place is located in a pretty sketchy neighborhood but once inside it's not that bad
we ordered
the tandoori_chicken dinner special
tandoori_chicken
saag_paneer
mixed_vegetables
the mixed curry dinner special
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken sagwala
chicken masala
dinner specials also come with dal soup
traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils
and choice of bread
we got garlic_naan roti
they also give you complimentary pappadum chutneys
mango_lassi
free with check in but they only let us have to share lol
tasted like a sour mango yogurt milkshake lol
the food was just ok
my favorite item was the chicken_tikka_masala the service absolutely sucked
even though there were servers just sitting around no one even came to refill our_water_glasses or check up on us even once
anyways after we left i started feeling sick and when we arrived home i most definitely was sick
ewww i got food poisoning from there and spent the next day feeling absolutely miserable
the total bill was over and the food quality was the same
if not worse than a standard lunch buffet
thank the lord i had a restaurant
com certificate so we only paid a little over
but it was not worth getting sick for
i will stick to mount_everest or try mint next time
blehhhhhhhh
hot tip
indian_lunch_buffets are absolutely the way to go
food is good and service is really awesome specially garry
he rocks
we will be back
i definitely have issues doing dinner at an indian restaurant that does a lunch buffet
it doesn't make total sense but i usually prefer origin india just for that reason
but it was late
we had the craving and my wife had a great experience
lunch buffet
the last time she was here so we gave it a go
the place was still full of people at pm so that was a plus
i was excited_to_see dosa on the menu but the waiter told me their grill wasn't on and it would take at least minutes to get ready
ok
nevermind
there's a free_mango_lassi with a yelp_check_in
he tells us it's only good for one lassi per table
fine
we unintentionally went vegetarian for the evening
my wife always gets the saag_paneer extra_spicy and i went with the matar paneer
both dishes were very good
the peas in my matar paneer were super sweet
maybe the sweetest pea i've ever had
i devoured them
the naan was pretty good but the aloo paratha wasn't worth the extra
i'll be back to try the lunch buffet but i think i am done with dinner here
use the yelp_deal
the food was good
the tables were nice
no better or worse than other_indian_places i suppose
the guy with the paint brush mustache was fun to look at
the server with the shaved head i felt got a little too familiar with us but it wasn't too bad
i have been eating at india_palace for years and i have not been disappointed
after trying a few other indian_restaurants_in_town i have returned here every time
the staff_is_very_friendly and knowledgeable and all of the items i have tried have been delicious
their_lunch_buffet is very reasonably_priced and a great way for people who aren't quite comfortable navigating the full menu
the uncomfortable feeling you experience when pulling up to this location will quickly subside once you get inside
the building itself is much nicer than it was when i started going five years_ago
bottom_line
i have not been to or heard of a better indian restaurant in las_vegas
this is my best indian food spot whenever i come to vegas
beautiful decor
good value
delicious flavored
i have tried other indian_restaurants in the area
but this one stands_out
specially tandoori chicken_wings
thumbs_up
i have to start by saying my boyfriend is indian and he loved this restaurant
he is generally hesitant about dining out for indian food because nothing can compare to his mamma's cooking this restaurant was as close_to_home as it gets
we are both vegetarians and loved that there were plenty of delicious options for us
we had veggie_samosas
vegetable_biryani
red daal
saag aloo
and baigan bartha
the bartha is rich and smoky tasting
the daal was creamy and lucious
everything was spicy enough to get your taste_buds excited but not so overwhelming as to make it painful
we left with plenty to take home and snack on for the next two days
the restaurant is clean and nicely_decorated
we enjoyed the bollywood music_videos playing around us
i knocked off one star for service
i dont expect good service at indian_restaurants and wasnt surprised with a service that was pretty much limited to throwing food on the table and bringing the check at the end
they would also benefit from a fulltime bartender while they had a full cocktail list i was hesitant to order from it doubting my waiter's ability to make a decent mojito
when the craving for a taste of home returns we will certainly be back
best place in las_vegas for indian food
i have tried them all
trust_me
love_this_place
amazing food
fantastic atmosphere
our whole family loves it
especially the mango_custard
good for take out
good ctm and kabobs
one of the best indian_restaurants anywhere
the dal soup was delicious perfectly spiced
hot
fresh naan right from the oven
lamb sagwal had tender chunks of meat in a spinach curry_sauce
equally tender
generous portion of chicken curry
and the peas pulao could not have been better
top it off with a kingfisher beer and go straight to heaven
great food
great service and excellent location
we ordered the dinner special
it is a great deal
get to taste a bunch of items
they have good beer_selection too
we got a mango_lassi on the house
my boyfriend and i came here on a groupon
and after reviewing the menu i was really excited_to_try this place
at first
everything was really nice
when we were being seated
the host told us a party of was coming in
and that the back room might be quieter
which it was
the back room has tables and is a nice intimate setting
note
that in the time we were there
one tour bus full of tourists came in
ate
left
and another bus full was coming in as we were leaving
the bus loads of people appeared constant
and if we had sat in the main dining_room
it might have been miserable
but anyway
everything we ate tasted really good
we ordered a goat dish
a lamb dish
and samosas
the veggie_samosas were kind of bland
and only had potato in them
but tasted fine
when we ordered it was a little weird that the waiter asked us what kind of rice and naan we wanted
as if it came with our meal
when in fact it didn't
i've never been to an indian restaurant that charged extra for rice
so i thought that was a little shady
but really none of that mattered
because towards the end of our meal
we found a hair in our food
a short
curly
kind of hair
we showed the manager
his response was
do you want some more rice
i can get you some free rice to go
i'll take off of your bill
mistakes happen
it probably came from the buffet
um
number one
we didn't eat from the buffet
and number two
dude there is a pubic hair in our food
while i appreciate him taking a little bit off of the bill
what i would really prefer is for him to look disgusted
and go back to his kitchen and have a very serious talk with his cooks about hygiene and cleanliness
but i had the distinct impression that wasn't going to happen
and he just sort of acted like
oh these things happen sometimes
maybe he didn't understand that this hair did not fall off of someone's head
so
even though the food tasted good
and up until that point we had been having a nice time
i really don't think i can get past a pubic hair in my food
we won't be back
i've eaten at most indian places_in_town over the years
this by far has been the best quality and best tasting indian food in vegas
the atmosphere and service is great
they have a traditional menu but the only place in town that has goat_curry which is amazing
typical indian restaurant
greasy and oily food
taste was okay
experience was okay at best
we used the yelp off coupon here the owner firstly frowned after looking at the deal
promotion that they had been running
he honored the deal but made_us_feel as if he was doing us a favor
they were catering a private party in the restaurant and still kept it open for general public
the party family kids created havoc
noise and jumped on our tables
horrible service
they never even cared to apologize for the inconvenience
at least they didnt serve us from the buffet as the party
which i have seen many cheap indian_restaurants do
there are many other good restaurants_in_vegas that have great reviews_on_yelp
skip this one if you can
alright so
i'm not indian
i don't really know what
authentic
is
but
i will say this
i've eaten at many different indian_restaurants in vegas and california
and india_palace remains number to me
this place is so
damn
good
also
just to throw this out there
i work with many indian people
and they really like this place a lot as well
take that information as you will
but
i think it's a good thing
i've been coming here for a very long time and i'm friendly with the staff
they are so polite and friendly
i have always felt very welcomed here since the beginning
the food
let's just talk about the food
it's amazing
my favorite being of course the chicken mahkani
butter_chicken
it's easily one of my favorite things to eat
ever
they bring you naan_bread to the table with an option of regular of garlic
always go with the garlic
it's not very overwhelming
i also do the buffet every time i come here
i've eaten here for dinner twice and while i really do love the food
i feel their dinner portions are rather small when compared to the price
one of these times i used a groupon and was never met with any kind of negativity
so it's weird to me that people are mentioning that
and as far as the rest of the service
i've never had issues with being neglected service or having my water filled
even when they're busy and hosting a party
anyway
the buffet is great because you get a sampling of a lot of different things for a low price which is never a bad thing
also
i give it a star_rating because as much as i love the food
i really hate driving here
it's in a not so lovely part_of_town and the parking here is a nightmare when they're busy
try it for lunch sometime
of course with a mango_lassi
i am from atlanta which is filled with indian_restaurants
but i never go and eat there as they suck
i visit vegas very often
and i try to eat at this place at least once when i am there
everything they make is just too good
i love their samosas kabobs naans
rather everything
they make everything just the way you want it to be
yummy
yummy
i ate soooo much
the food was good
i bought a yelp_deal
they used to let customers to use it for lunch buffet per_person
but i called them and the guy said no more
the deal is only for regular price items
i wish they can allow us to use it for lunch buffet again so i can group my friends former coworkers to eat and have some fun
i've been here twice for lunch with co_workers now
and both times have deeply enjoyed myself and had to waddle out
first thing's first
when you go
order the garlic_naan
it's wonderful hot crispy fluffy naan
slathered with minced garlic and herbs
and i could probably just eat that and the curry_sauce by the bucketful
it's not an additional price on top of the buffet
which is what takes india_palace from stars for me
so garlicky and wonderful
the buffet itself is pretty typical indian for mostly americans fare
i had the aloo_gobi
butter_chicken
a few curries
goat_curry
and bahji
which were all good
and i had no real complaints
some of the chunks of chicken were those hard fatty bits
and a little bit unpleasant
but those are pretty expected in stews curries etc and overall
everything was great
the saag_paneer stuck out as particularly delicious
they were great about honoring the free_mango_lassi yelp_check_in deal
and
since it was my first time trying lassi
i haven't tried one before because i'm not usually a yogurt fan
and i haven't wanted to spend on a drink i will probably not like
but hey
free is the right price to try_new_things
so i tried a new thing and really enjoyed it
i can't say if it was good or bad in lassi terms as i have nothing to compare it to
but i can say i plan on trying more lassi's now so that i can find out
and i think that's a pretty good sign for it's tastiness
i will_definitely_be_back for the lunch buffet
but i think i will need to try some of the other_indian_places around town before i choose my
go to
dinner joint
the a la_carte menu seems a little pricey around dinner time here
but the lunch buffet price is perfect for me
i came in for the lunch buffet and i was surprised they had more options than my usual indian rotation
mint and mt
everest
however
this place was quantity more than quality
the goat_curry was really salty
like really
it masked the flavor of whatever spices they put
the vegetable mikhana
veggie tikka masala
was off
way off to a point it was sourish
however
the chicken mikhana
chicken_tikka_masala
was actually tasty
i guess they cook it differently
the chicken was so tender it was shredding apart
i enjoyed their palak_paneer as well
but the paneer was too tough for my taste
it couldn't pick_up the flavor of the spinach and spices
overall
i would not be able to fit this place into my rotation
however
service was great
my water was never empty and i was downing that water like crazy because of the goat_curry
i went in on a tuesday and they charged me
which is not right according to the information on this listing
or maybe they overcharged me
this place has the most awesome food and best service
manni is the best server ever and made our visit most memorable
best restaurant experience in vegas
i had purchased a living_social deal at the last minute
we ended_up going with a huge party
i had a peach drink that was on fire
don't recall the name of it
it was delicous
our server was really great
made spot on suggestions cracked the occasional joke
for a table of we ordered rogan_josh
sag paneer and two orders of chicken_tikki_masala
two orders of rice and two orders of garlic_naan
everything was just delicious
not a negative thing to say about the entire meal
highly_recommend
never call them for an order
the guy i called for order was rude and impolite
i am writing this review even before tasting the food
the guy on the phone go me really worked up
i am saying this even though i am an indian
staff at indian_restaurants can be a total ass
we've been looking for a good indian_restaurant_in_vegas since we moved from nyc and read about india_palace so decided to check it out for dinner
it was pretty quiet on a sunday_night
there were only a few other patrons
which is a shame because our experience at india_palace was great
as other yelpers mention
they are located near the strip but on the border of a crappy neighborhood
i wonder if they were in a better location if they would have more diners
but i digress
they served papadum and different dipping_sauces when we sat_down
which was very nice
we started with the kheema samosas for an appetizer
the shell was nice and crispy and not greasy at all
they were filled with delicious ground lamb and green peas
i thought it was wonderful with the date sauce
the dark brown one
on it
we ordered the chicken_korma and chicken_tikka_masala for entrees
both were very good
the chicken was very tender
the entrees didn't come with rice
as has been our experience at most indian_restaurants
so we had ordered a side of peas pulao rice and garlic_naan
i loved the rice with peas and nuts in it
the garlic_naan was also very good and not greasy at all
service was attentive and all the staff very friendly
the restaurant was neat and clean
there were tvs playing bollywood which was fun
they weren't on too loud and i always find it hard to not watch
our waiter provided us with containers to pack our leftovers
if we weren't so full
i would have liked to try their dessert menu
our dinner came out to about
including tax and tip
indian food is always a little pricey
so i thought it was good value for what we got
we enjoyed our experience here and will_definitely_be_back to try other menu_items
the dosas in particular
they honored the free_mango_lassi for checking in
which was delicious with my meal
thanks yelp
i live out east and have dined here during my last trips to vegas
the food is very good
the staff very nice
well sized portions as well
good value for your money
will_definitely_go_back would recommend_this_place to friends
very good hotel
food tasted really nice
they have a gift card for that you may possibly use immediately if you bought this before seating
also
they may give you of if you are group of or more
this is my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in las_vegas
the people here are all really nice and helpful
the food is delicious and very consistently so
i love that when i order spicy
they actually make it spicy
some ethnic restaurants assume americans can't tolerate a little heat
the location is a little dodgy but the interior is actually quite nice and inviting
be on the lookout for coupons and specials they participate in a lot of the usual deal sites
food is very good
the owners are great
but the manager was unprofessional
he may no longer be there
we ordered a groupon and called in and explained that we had a groupon worth and ordered some food to go
i clearly explained my groupon
and there was no problem with the to go order from the employee on the phone who was polite
after driving miles
we arrived
the manager said the groupon is for dining in only
i said
why did they not tell me that on the phone
as i told them i had a groupon
anyway
he did not want to honor the promotion
then i asked him his name
and he wouldn't tell me his name
he said they don't make any money on the groupon
i said
then why do you offer it
that is not my problem
i bought it
ordered
and then drove miles
and now he is not wanting to honor the promotion
did you read the fine print
he asked
no i said
instead
i called your restaurant and explained that i had a groupon and they took my order
and i in good faith came all this way expecting a smile and a thank you
and now i get a no
and he was very mean to me
disrespectful
not being considerate at all
of course this upset me
and i began to raise my voice
then he was upset that i raised my voice in his restaurant
i told_him
i did not come here to raise my voice
i came here for some tikka masala
but i will never come here again
trust_me
it is unfortunate
that they have such good food here
yet
the manager is a hothead
and i feel sorry for the employees that have to work for him
the poor guy that took my order
oh my
he is going to get the wrath
he did not want to listen to anything i said
in spite of it all i still tipped him just because i am someone that has worked in the restaurant industry
and i follow the golden rule
but i will tell you
this manager was a real jerk
now
there are so many restaurants out there that would love to have a customer that drives miles to come to them
and they will do everything in their power to make that customer feel special
this manager threatened to call the police on me
can you believe that
wow
if he worked for me i would fire him so fast
anyway
this is a good restaurant and they have good food
and i am sure the owners are good people
they need to help their people understand the promotions
and then make sure that every customer interaction is appreciated
i really like the food
it is unfortunate that i have had so much grief here
i blame the manager
no cs skills whatsoever
anyway
i do think this is a good restaurant
the owner call me up after this an apologized for the experience i had
i thanked him for the call
this is a lovely restaurant
and the food is fantastic
i say go ahead and give them another chance
i've been here before and had tried to find it again to no avail
a friend and i happened to both want indian at the same time
but having no idea where to go turned to my trusty yelp app and it found this awesome place for me again
it's tucked off in a little shopping area
but well lit and easy_to_find
it's got a great
cozy interior with roomy booths and indian movies playing constantly
it has a full bar also
checked in using my yelp app and received a free drink called a mango_lassi
i would never have known to ask for this had i not gotten this check in offer
but i'm_so_glad i did
it was seriously delicious
it's mango and yogurt and it was part of the reason i couldn't eat all of my food
highly_recommend you get this fabulous drink
for an appetizer we had vegetable_samosas
they were dense and a little dry
but with the spicy cilantro sauce to put on it it tasted just fine
you get two and they're a nice size
for dinner my friend had chicken_tikka_masala
which
while not outside the box is definitely a solid choice
he liked it and proceeded to eat all of it
i had the mata paneer and it was just the right spicy
medium
with a rich tomato y taste mixed with peas and the paneer cheese
had it over a bed of jasmine rice and it was super filling
one of my favorite dishes
also ordered a side of garlic_naan which was okay
it wasn't the best i've ever had
way too much garlic
but it was find and went okay with the meal
the service here can be spotty
i wasn't impressed with that at all
but it's not the worst i've had
so
anyway
great food
nice_atmosphere and at a reasonable_price
definitely recommend
i really enjoyed this place
food was extraordinary
my girlfriend and i tried two dinner specials and we really enjoyed everything
prices_are_pretty high
but you get what you pay for
i was told its the best place in vegas by my fellow indian frds but was ver much disappointed
i was not welcome will a short built guy pointed and showed me the table and wen i ask him a drink he said the bartender was not there
so i asked him a red_wine cabernet he instead bought me a white wine
the food was excellent and gr but the service was moderate
there was no refill on my water wen i needed most
i really did not know why my server was angry and he smelled of alcohol too
das was around
and there ver only tables
anyways thanks to the chef and my fellow friends for recommeding for the lovely food
first time trying it
and i'm already in love with it
best indian food out there
we had dinner before it got real busy which was o
k
with me
try the hayward imported indian beer
the food was great and the service wasn't bad
not the greatest part_of_town but oh well
glad we went
this place has great food
i love the chicken_korma and the basil naan a bunch
whenever i am in las_vegas
i try and make it to india_palace
it's off the strip but not too far away but would require a short cab ride
but in my opinion
it's better than any of the places on the strip for indian food
give them a try
we came on a friday_night and ordered
vegetable_samosa appetizer
tandoori_chicken dinner
for
used the groupon to get credit
came out to
seated_right_away
fancy restaurant
dim lighting
wine style cup glasses
edwin was a friendly server
he seemed to appreciate that we came in to eat indian food and made sure that our drinks were refilled and the food made to our liking
they didn't have the lamb samosa tonight
which we were a bit disappointed so we ended_up with the vegetable
comes with
cooked fresh and crispy
you are given complimentary flat_bread and types of sauces
mild
med
hot
flat_bread tasted a bit burnt
but crispy
garlic_naan was fluffy
chicken soup was watery but spicy
mango dessert was good
tasted like filipino fruit salad
fried vegetables were a bit smushy
tandoori_chicken was a slighly dry and the onoins were grilled inconsistently
undercooked or overcooked
india_masala and mint_bistro packs more flavor for my liking than india_palace
but nonetheless
still a good eat especially with the groupon
i wish i could get here more often
the service is very good and the food is amazing
the seating is nice
this place is much better than more popular places i won't mention
took a friend here and we were both very pleased
everything was top_notch
give it a try
we had the chicken_korma and goat karahi
which was fantastic
nan and rice was very nice
might want to ask for extra spicey as they tend to cater to the white man
overall the service was good
kitchen could have been a little quicker and the bartender more knowledgeable
but otherwise a great place for a tasty meal
there's lots of coupons floating around the web for this restaurant
so there's no reason to pay full price
but even if you do end up paying full price
the cost is reasonable
they have a large menu featuring many vegetarian_dishes
chicken
lamb
goat
and other traditional_indian foods
their lamb menu_is_extensive
and being a huge_fan_of lamb
i get some variety of lamb every time i come here
i haven't eaten a single thing here that i didn't like
their naan is to die for
particularly the garlic_naan
i wasn't a big_fan of their buffet
it was small and there weren't very many spicy dishes
however
for those nervous about trying indian food for the first time
the buffet menu offers a variety of mild
common indian dishes
they also serve you a plate of naan
i would say this is one of the best indian places_in_town at this price range
the waiters could be more courteous and not have an expression that made me feel like i've entered a funeral home
buffet items were bland and blah
rotis were delicious
nice ambience
my gripe with this place just like most indian places is the lack of spice and flavor in they food
for some reason the dishes lack the character of their indian counterparts
in india the same dish will be extremely flavorful
my first mistake i guess comparing with the taste back home
but what's the point in calling yourself fine indian_cuisine if you can't be authentic and recreate the exact flavors
also
my mom without knowing the
rules of the land
asked for pickles
the staff were extremely helpful and got her a cup full of it and later slipped me an extra
when asked why he goes oh
if it's not on the menu then you pay
ok
why can't you tell her that first
instead of slipping one in
not that i had a problem paying for it
he is right
but the lack of customer_service or ethics just irked me
buffet is reasonably_priced with enough items
improve customer_service
remember it's the customer who makes or breaks your business
improve flavor don't forget the roots of the dish
i know it is dumbed down to cater to local tastes but hey if i want to eat bland food i have lot of cheaper and healthier options
awesome food
great atmosphere
food was a bit expensive but totally_worth it
went on a thursday evening and it was still crowded
usually a really good sign considering that the restaurant is in a weird part of las_vegas
looked shady
the inside of the restaurant was really well decorated and we felt comfortable once we settled in
checked in on yelp and got a free_mango_lassi
wow
really tasty
had the samosas and aloo_tikki
both good
had the non_veg curry thali and all the components was fantastic except the mango_custard
next time i will try something else
it came with lamb in spinach
chicken_tikka_masala and shrimp_curry
excellent
we will be back soon
best_indian_food_i_have_ever had in america
we ordered the goat lamb dishes
garlic_naan this phenomenal rice dish
the waiter was very nice helped us place our order
we wanted to try something new yet more traditional
the setting was quiet comfortable
don't let the neighborhood scare you
this is a must have
this will be a place we will always come back to when we visit vegas
the food is good
but don't bother trying to get delivery from them
the last three times they cancelled my order
first they didn't have a driver
then they
had a flat tire
i don't know their excuse for the third time
they are currently on grubhub and eat
not ordering from them again
this is our favorite indian restaurant
the food is excellent
the portions are quite generous without being excessive
and the service is attentive and usually pretty fast
love_this_place
curries are very tasty their naan is oh so yummylicous
the chicken_korma is so good my wife's exact words where
my vagina gets wet every time i eat this sauce
only if i had known
it was not love at first sight for my friend indian food and myself
in fact
we hated one another pretty good in the beginning
all of that changed after my first experience at india_palace
to be honest
i've only eaten at two indian_restaurants in my life
after eating here
i'm not sure i will venture elsewhere
so on a lonely afternoon my wife and i decided to ditch our co_workers and meet for lunch
fortunately india_palace had a yelp dealio going down where you get of grub for
a stellar deal
no restrictions were mentioned upon purchase
however when i presented the coupon the server said it was only valid for dinner
after explaining there were no restrictions mentioned in the disclaimer or at the time of purchase he graciously accepted the coupon and we enjoyed their_lunch_buffet with two refreshing pepsi cola beverages
i'm a huge_fan_of their tandoori_chicken
but the meal wouldn't be complete without their piping_hot
freshly baked nan
i could honestly make a meal just out of that
my favorite item at the buffet is the chicken_tikka_masala
which is tandoori_chicken marinated in yogurt spices in a creamy tomato sauce
it's
am and my mouth is watering just thinking about it
i even enjoyed a serving of their creamy spinach
popeye would be proud
the service at india_palace is always exceptional
the servers are friendly_and_attentive
your drink never stays empty for long
plates are whooshed away at lightening speed upon completion
and i always leave here feeling good about my experience and reminded as to why i've never gone to any_other_indian_restaurant
glowing stars
india_palace never disappoints
chicken_tikka_masala is amazing and the bhindi_masala is delicious
we always get garlic_naan with our meal and make sure to order extra to take home
my husband and i try to come here as often as we can
went here with my boyfriend today and loved it
the food was delicious
especially the chicken marsala
great service by both the waiter
who was friendly and fast
and the kitchen staff that brought the food out
overall a great experience
i just tried this place today
it was delicious
i bought a groupon for it
we had some of the vegetarian_options on hand
totally authentic and delicious
great service too
my wife was craving_indian_food so we went to her favorite indian restaurant
i ordered a taj_mahal beer free_mango_lassi with the yelp_check_in
we ordered the following food items
vegetable_samosa
garlic_naan
chicken_tikka_masala
mixed grilled tandoori
everything was excellent as usual
our server garry was very nice and helpful
i promised to let everyone know that he was the best
went there for lunch buffet
not the nicest experience
we shouldn't have even stayed to eat but i wanted to be fair and give things a taste
everything looked like it had been sitting in the serving trays for days
the meat looked grey and dry
as well as the meager amount of jasmine they put out
and the quality of the meat didn't seem that well
meat was chewy
i wasn't the goat
service was slow and mostly unresponsive
went there for dinner at pm
got crowded at about pm
full house
building was nice on the outside
but did not expect the dumpy location around it
thinking diamond in the rough
not quite
service was good until it got busy then it was ok
i had to go up to the bar to cash the check cause i didn't see waiter for a while
food was neutral
not really bad but not great
garlic_naan was really the best thing
i was expecting more flavors but it was ok
they got my order wrong
chicken instead of shrimp
shrimp came out rubbery
they take tail off
small shrimp
chicken tica tamdoori was good but they brought that out like it was an appetizer
it was my husband's main entr_e
i'm not sure what happened with that
but we weren't going to complain in front of friends
plus the onions such were not cooked all the way
i don't eat raw onions
they barely cooked them
small portions for price
don't know we would go back unless friends absolutely wanted to go there
too bad because i thought we found the best indian place in town
apart from the mediocre food
the service is worst
they don't honor yelp deals
definitely a place to avoid
we came here with the intention of getting take out
we were greeted_by vick who was very friendly_and_helpful
he offered suggestions on drink and appetizer while waiting
his cheerful demeanor won us over and we decided to dine in
the restaurant was very clean
his service was excellent and the food was very good
vick makes excellent suggestions for food choices
based_on the area the restaurant is in we were pleasantly_surprised at the quality of service we received
highly_recommended
for being in a highly tourist concentrated area
it's mins away from the las_vegas strip
this restaurant is fantastic
my family of four was greeted and seated_immediately by vick
he was kind and went out of his way to make suggestions and even make jovial conversation
the food was fantastic and the portions large considering we have enough left_overs to make a meal out of
would definitely recommend to tourists and locals alike
india_palace is a very good indian restaurant
very good indian food not like others which really dont taste indian
and whenever u go there as for manny
he was very nice and funny made_us_feel very comfortable
excellent indian food
i enjoyed the special vegetarian dinner and mixed appetizers
gary
our server
was very attentive to our needs
friendly atmosphere
i have been dining here for over years
i am an indian who is very passionate about my food
each time i visit india_palace
food and service always exceeds expectations
our top favorite items on the menu are chicken_tikka_masala
paneer_tikka
bhindi_masala and malai_kofta
the staff is very polite and go out of their way to give you best possible service
today our server was gary
i forgot my gift card in the restaurant and he ran out to the parking_lot in the cold weather
looking for us and handed me my gift card which still had a balance of
thank you gary and thank you india_palace for taking care of my indian food cravings for all these years
you are the best
it has been years since i review about this restaurant
i would like to add my compliments towards our server garry again
as always
we were greeted with a warm welcome by garry
he has been superb and accommodating
garry introduced us to the tandoori dinner and i must say it was delicious
we had masala_dosa the yummiest lamb_biryani
love their chai too
great experience as always
thanks garry for the number one customer_service rendered to us
awesome service by our fave server garry
outstanding
great job
thank you
food was great
our server garry was great too
the manager was professional
he honored my yelp checkin free_mango_lassi
which was yummy
and yelp's for deal too without any hesitation
we were a group of four for dinner and it turned_out_to_be total including the above discounts
tip and taxes
would love to go again
i was in the mood for indian while visiting las_vegas and i liked that they offer a free mango lasi for checking in on yelp
the first time i visit an indian restaurant i stick with certain dishes
i ordered the malai_kofta
chicken_tikka_masala
samosas
and garlic_naan bread
the naan_bread was the best part of the meal
it was well made and came out piping out
the samosas were so oily that i barely touched then
the malai_kofta had a nice flavor
but i did not enjoy the chicken_tikka_masala at all
it tasted a little like feet
my meal wasn't terrible but i didn't like that they charged for both the rice and the naan_bread
one is usually complimentary when you order an entree
i probably would not return because there are plenty of indian_restaurants to try in las_vegas
the management at this place has no regard for it's patrons whatsoever
we came in for a lunch buffet and the food selection was sub par to say the least
we were a group of and we were treated with such disrespect that it is appalling
we tried using a yelp_deal and not only were they unwilling to accept it they were very rude about telling us that it they cannot take it
the rest rooms at this place were the worst of all the restaurants_in_vegas
i'd give no stars if i could
avoid this place like a plague
there are much better indian_restaurants around
the food was good i'll give them that
but their service and credibility are questionable
though i strongly recommend looking elsewhere for indian food if you must go here check your bill
these_guys messed up our bill and then refused to address it saying that during the holidays that's what their policy is
they also don't take gift cards during the holidays and apparently all of las_vegas recognizes the holidays as december th through december st
though i don't work in the restaurant industry i still have work tomorrow
also they took forever to take our order
then forgot what we ordered and had to take it again
and brought dishes out one at a time
cause maybe some people like cold food
either way service being shitty
not the only place
but blatantly cheating customers is a whole new level of shady
it's good food but if you must go be careful
manpreet aka manny is awesome
he totally helped us out and fed us soooo much food
we could hardly move
awesome food amazing service
a favorite when in vegas
authentic food and great service
a go to indian getaway from the strip
not as full for an early dinner
full menu and about miles from the strip
amazing food
server vick is the best
so charming
excellent customer_service
consumer beware
beware
before going to this restaurant
they have raised all their prices including buffet which is now at a ridiculous
per_person
nowhere do they inform you of the new prices until u get the bill
we ordered from the menu as well and the quantity is a joke even one person cannot eat on the ridiculously priced dal
the buffet was even worse with stale food
empty buffet trays that were being refilled at snails pace with just a few pieces of chicken that are now cut in half than previously served
dessert milk had gone bas with pungent taste
bread was cold
tixe was hard as a rock
which means it was from the day before and re heated
glasses smelled similar to foul meat which means not cleaned thoroughly
we are very dissappointed we were regulars at this restaurant and don't know what happened
maybe its new management or maybe its just the want to make money and let go of quality and serve your customers horrendous quality of food whatever the case they have gone downhill
save yourself the bad experience and do not eat here not worth it anymore
for this price you can eat at a fancy restaurant in vegas
on a positive note the waiters are nice
and thats about it on the niceness part
a note to management
do not rip un suspecting customers your prices have gone up and quality is horrible
great place
chicken_tikka_masala is one of the best i've ever had
great service and nice and clean
highly_recommended
first time here
simply awesome
tried the buffet for new taste options
goat_curry is delicious
rice_pudding is perfect dessert with an indian coffee
my brother had the goat briyani
very good
spiced just right
we will be back
excellent
we found this place with
groupon
and will_definitely_go_back when in vegas
i agree the chicken marsala was the best i've had anywhere
the naan was fresh and hot and my mouth is watering just thinking about it
loads of flavor
very attentive
friendly_staff who take pride in their delicious selections
thank you manny
loved it
hope to see you again soon
great food but inattentive staff
we were visiting_vegas for new year's using the deal we got from livingsocial
we had no idea that this was only for regular dining not the buffet
after a minute of standing there
somebody flagged down a waiter for us to have us seated
not sure if he was a diner or the owner but thank you whoever you are
we were seated in the corner and the waiter didn't seem to care because he left us alone for about minutes without a menu or telling us what was going on
after observing everyone_else
we noticed that they just got up and served themselves
apparently it was a buffet
so
we decided to do the same
after we were done with our meal
that was when another waiter came up to us and told us that our livingsocial deal was supposed_to_be for the regular menu not the buffet
he asked the manager and they decided to honor it
the meal was good because they had a variety to choose from
i just wished the had staff that were more attentive
you won't find a better indian food restaurant west of the mississippi
ask for manny when you stop in
excellent food the flavors
the environment and the service
my server garry came to check on me several times and took great care of me start experience
this place rocks
i have eaten at indian places all over the western us and i've never had better indian food than this place
garry
our waiter
was incredibly nice and gave_us fantastic service
every_single dish we have tried is better than any other place here in vegas
so far we have tried the chicken_korma
chicken_vindaloo
malai_kofta
and the chicken_tikka_masala and they are all to die for
the meat is cooked_perfectly and the sauces are so good you will lap it up from your plate
give these_guys a try
you won't regret it
i went to india_palace a few days_ago with a friend for the lunch buffet
it was delicious
i am vegetarian so i appreciated that the buffet had several vegetarian_options
my friend had the tandoori_chicken and she said it was very good
i can't comment too much on the service
because the buffet does not require much from the server
in the past i have had very good service at dinner time
the chicken_tikka_masala was honestly the best i've ever had
the sauce was smooth and perfectly spiced
the cheese_naan was very light and soft and perfectly paired the masala
the only complaint was that the masala didn't come with rice
just ate at the india_palace and wow
tandoori_chicken was moist and delicious
chicken_tikka_masala was maybe the best i've ever tasted and the curry was perfect
top it off with great naan_bread and unbelievable service from manny and the result is my first yelp review ever
i've had indian food in various countries to include england and countries very close to india and this is in the top ever
we ventured into this neighborhood trying to get some neat food on a cold night
since it was our first night in vegas and we dint know this side of the city very well we ended_up coming in the wrong side out from our hotel and i must say the route was super scary to walk by
i barely thought of how could any restaurant be tucked in this neighbourhood
once we went in we were seated and we ordered malai_kofta
very enriching taste
and korma with naan
the food was overall very good
the service was not exactly great or worth mentioning but the power of food overpowered the service and hence the solid four stars
this restaurant was a wonderful experience
it's located in a seedy part of the road
but it is a find
you know when there's a limo in the parking_lot
that's a clue
they have an extensive_menu
so we tried the aloo_tikki appetizer
and it was four tasty fried cakes and very good
then
we ordered the basic items we use to tell one restaurant from another
the lamb_korma is great
with more lamb than most others
and the lamb is very tasty and tender
there is enough sauce
so you can have just sauce and rice
too
yummy
the chicken_tikki marsala is very tender
again with more chicken than usual
very good sauce
the garlic_naan is perfect
very lightly crispy on the surface
and chewy inside
with a dusting of herbs for good looks
you know
every dish here is pretty
too
they make a firm vodka martini
and the recommended taj_mahal beer was just right
good service
very attentive
and
auntie tarala
will tell you with a lift of her eyebrow if you get it right
the charming manager stopped by to answer questions
and be sure we were happy
we were
so you can have a lovely indian meal
at a reasonable_price
without the noise and crowds of the strip
just minutes away
in an easy drive
the parking is a free lot
i have been to many indian_restaurants around and this one is by far the best and my favorite
it was refreshing to be greeted_by manny with such spectacular hospitality as if we were family and the customer_service was amazing
he was extremely friendly and pleasant and made my experience there top_notch
vick was wonderful and helpful as well
the food was phenomenal
much so that we went back two more times during our stay in las_vegas
every dish was so absolutely_delicious and seasoned perfectly
also
the portions were quite generous and they had a huge vegetarian selection
with service and food that was out_of_this_world
there is no need to go anywhere_else
i will definitely be returning every time i go to vegas
india_palace is my favorite place to dine in vegas
although a buck or two more than others for the lunch buffet
it's worth it
it's the tastiest i've had so far
the manager was very helpful pointing out the vegan offerings
even offering an all i can eat from the menu if the buffet didn't suffice
it did and was very tasty
he even brought me lentil crackers
since their bread was non vegan
nice_atmosphere inside
nicely_decorated
for my personal taste
shared by very few
it was too salty
but my friends found it very much to their liking
i checked in for the mango lasi
but gave it to a friend bcuz it's non vegan
my friend loved it
it is where it is
but you're driving
right
if you like indian food
check this out
the owner is from punjab
we went there on a weekday night by pm
as the place closes by
pm
they refused to let us dine in but said that we can order take away
we ordered plain naans
garlic naans and chicken_tikka_masala
we waited for mins but we were not given any update on our order
only when we started to pester them about our order they hurried into the kitchen to get it ready
the taste of the food was good
the parking_lot was a bit cramped
it would have been full if we had come by pm
service was the main negative of this place
they were not hospitable to us
too business oriented and in your face attitude
i had the chicken_tika marsala with almond and cashew rice
now
i eat a ton of indian food and i've had my favorite place for years now
as of tonight
there's a new favorite in my quiver
manny served me tonight and he was great
as was everybody else
i'll be back
very good food
i came here a couple times for their_lunch_buffet and paid about
incl tip
each time
if you're a big eater
i would say it's well worth it
the staff is friendly and provided us good service each time
amazing food
it came to us extremely hot just right off the stove
hands off to the chef with his skills this place is amazing
service was great see manny for his excellent customer_service and his perfect timing
would_definitely_come_back to this place next time i'm here from la
this is a hidden_gem
it's in a bad neighborhood but the food is worth_the_trip
it's possibly the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
our waiter vick was super knowledgeable and entertaining
for me
this place is never a bad choice
and they've always got awesome bollywood vids playing
very good buffet lunch spread and a mango_lassi worth yelping out
this place is way off the strip and a
pitstop worth the ride for all indian food fanatics
the mutton chicken dishes are good and nothing beats an all_you_can_eat buffet for under
i went out to dinner and was in search of indian food a couple of weeks_ago
i decided to try this place because there was a coupon available
i ordered chicken_vindaloo
garlic_naan and some rice
the food was fantastic
and i asked for extra_spicy frequently i have issues with restaurants not making the food spicy enough but they did a great job here at india_palace without ruining the flavor
also
the server
mani
was fantastic
great attitude
good humor and took care of me the entire time
i will_definitely_be_back
i love indian food
india_palace is probably the best indian food you can get in vegas
the service is great
the food
even better
there are only two suggestions i can make to management
please change the god awful television playing on the wall
it is like watching a mexican sitcom
they all look the same
everything is over acted and nothing is funny
well
the same can be said about what is on the tvs at india_palace
i like wine
servers at india_palace will cork the wine behind the bar and bring an uncorked bottle to the table
this is a big no no in wine service
see my review of the broiler in hawaii
anyway
visit this place
the tv is terrible
wine is uncorked
wine faux pas
but the service and food are spot on
this is the best_indian_food_in_vegas
beautiful decor
full bar
there is definitely a master spicer behind the kichen door
wow
fabulous food and courteous waitstaff
the combination dinners are a tremendous value
more food than one can eat
and they even let me substitute one of the dishes
i will be back again
so good
my husband and i hadn't had indian in a long time
and the waiter there was so nice and helpful
he gave_us great advice based_on our preferences and what we'd be sharing
the food was marvelous
the service quick and friendly
plus
we loved that they had a selection of indian beers the perfect complement to the spiciness
we'll_definitely_be_back
i love indian food and begged my friends to go try this place out with me
the location looks small
but it's actually really roomy when you get inside
the parking_lot was really tiny though
but it wasn't crazy crowded so it wasn't too much of an issue
with the food
i was really delightfully surprised by this dollar indian buffet
it was excellent
some of the food was not as warm as i thought it would be
which was sort of a turn off for me
it probably would have tasted better if it were warmer
i did enjoy the saag_paneer as well as any dishes that had chicken in it
our experience with service was good
our waiter was very friendly_and_attentive
although he was a bit slow with the check and water
honestly
i would go again
i'm going to get food made to order
so it's hot
but i am definitely willing to come back
don't pass this place over and don't forget to use that check in deal
my experience with dining at indian_restaurants are pretty much buffet
buffet
non buffet
and buffet
india_palace is probably my nd favorite right now but it's probably still a
star place
it's located on the south side of twain some where between swenson and paradise
it's not in the best locations but it's not that far from the strip or university which is always good
they offer a lunch buffet m f for pretty much the same price as every other indian lunch buffet north of
the selections aren't huge but for what they offered mostly delicious
again i'm not that experienced with indian food so i don't even know what the dishes are called so i made a plate of everything i liked and took a pic
http
www
yelp
com_biz_photos india_palace las_vegas
select vwiliowvruumaseo vb sa hzgrixobisfswoe ea lq there were a couple dishes which seemed spicier than the other places i've been to and i really enjoyed
the garlic_naan here was the best i've had
the red chicken was spicy just the way i liked it
there's potential to be my favorite place but i couldn't
i only really liked maybe or of the items on the buffet
at the time there was a free lassi with yelp_check_in unfortunately they only accepted one for our entire party but i got it haha
the mango_lassi was good
great way to end the meal
the interior is nice with many tables and a few tv's playing indian movies
it seemed like a pretty full bar
their parking situation isn't great
sevice was alright
i'd be back
during day
i had the chicken_tikka_masala and it was delicious
i would have to say this is probably the best masala i have tasted in a long time and i have been to many indian restraunts around the country
the bryani also was tasty
i will be back soon
the flavors were amazing in all the dishes i tried
ac
i love it here
everything we ordered was great
gary is the friendliest and most helpful waiter
i recommend_this_place_to_anyone who is looking for some good indian food and great customer_service
my husband and i went here for the first time
the papadums were tasty and came with three sauces
mint
spicy and a brown one
i like the brown one
not sure what flavor it is
the mint and spicy sauces were too spicy for me since i'm pregnant
our starters was papdi chaat which was crunchy with a great taste
for our main_courses
we shared the chicken_tikka and shrimp jalfrezi with rice and roti
the rice is a huge portion which we didn't even eat half of
the chicken_tikka was very tasty with the onions and peppers
the chicken_tikka tasted even better with the brown sauce that comes with the papadums
the shrimp jalfrezi was great over rice and placed on the roti
the food is delicious
the service was great
indians always know how to give good service
vick was personable
attentive and had many great recommendations and made dining here very pleasurable
the food was staggered and kept coming
start to finish everything was delicious
i get into town times per year and definitely will be back next time
don't miss this little hidden_gem off the strip
excellent food
i got the tandoori_chicken with the medium spiciness which was perfect
the chicken was perfectly_cooked and the flavor was really
really mouthwatering good
i also got the basmati_rice
which was perfect as well
the cheese_naan was worth it as well
very soft and fresh with great flavor
i love the mint sauce that came along with it and the brown sauce was excellent as well
i will come back the next_time_i'm_in_vegas for business
i ate a bunch of high end high rated food in the resorts while i was here and this is what stood_out the most
i'm partial to this kind of stuff
though
but ultimately i'd love to try many other things on their menu after the awesome flavor and great quality of the food i had here this evening
surprisingly nice all round
the neighborhood is no great shakes but the restaurant is top_notch
awesome
first the smells were amazing when i walked into the doors
then the food was just as delicious as the smells
i was bought here a while ago with a friend
i've never eaten indian food
i'm hooked
this buffet style lets you check out other flavored and spices
i'd come here before
pm
the buffet starts going down hill
i've never ordered off the menu
why
when you have so many great flavored at the buffet
i like this place
it's clean cheap and good
so many flavor hit you palette it's not even funny
i'd recommend_this_place to at least try it out
olmoosedog out
lunch buffet is typical of most others
every time i've been
it's been good
pretty typical buffet selection
i like it
but it's not that special
not sure what else to say
great food and great service
vick was awesome
i live at henderson but i drive all the way here to get masala_dosa
it's delicious
i highly_recommend this place
i have only gone for the lunch buffet and i must say it is pretty good
all the servers are nice not great but nice
this is my go to indian_joint when i am craving indian
definitely give it a try
the food in buffet was good n the people nice n friendly
for me the food could_have_been_better if more spicy
the food and restaurant was good
we love india_palace because it has halal food that caters to muslims
their buffet was superb as always
i am a dosa lover
this is the only buffet restaurant with dosa included
garry was our server and as always he gave while serving us
we appreciate him as always
garry was great with suggestions when asked about the food there
thanks again for the being the best
garry
food was delicious
we loved the vegetarian dinner
such great flavor and a beautiful presentation
i also liked the fact that when i ordered a
mild
dish
it was mild
yummo
as residents of las_vegas
my husband and i have been to many indian_cuisine restaurants throughout the city
when we discovered india_palace through restaurant
com
we have never been to another indian restaurant since
they say one of the signs of a good ethnic restaurant is when you observe a lot of people of that ethnicity dining there
well
we have
and one time
even an entire tour bus of indian people came in
that's because the food is excellent and authentic
also
we enjoy mixed cocktails and most indian_restaurants only serve beer_and_wine
india_palace has a full bar
and the service is exceptional
we have come to know garry
and he takes care of us almost every time
he's very committed to our comfort and that we are having the best dining_experience
parking is super easy
right in front
and it's easy to get to
it's right off of a main intersection
we couldn't recommend it more
personable and lovely staff
food is amazing
i wish i could give it a thousand stars
found my new favorite restaurant
best_indian_food_in_las_vegas in my opinion
however i have only eaten at total
if there is a better one please let me know
but this india_palace is legit
i really love everything on the menu but my favorites are the chicken_vindaloo
tiki_masala
lamb samosa
raita
garlic_naan bread
tandoori_chicken
mango_lassi is a must also
you aren't going to get the most incredible service here but the place is clean and has a very nice classy atmosphere
it's all about the food here
the lamb_korma is one of the best things i've_ever_eaten and service is impeccable
even when using discount
definitely reasonable pricing and portions
don't let the neighborhood scare you this is a superior indian place to many in fancier locations
i've come here for ladies lunch and family dinner same happy tummy
india_palace has been my go to indian food spot for a while now
i stick to lunch_buffets as i don't really mess with dinner at most indian_restaurants
its usually just the same served a la_carte at higher prices
palace along with majority of the all the indian_restaurants_in_town is located in a somewhat shady area just north of unlv
while the area might suck
ip is probably the nicest building in the area which helps a bit
going into a indian lunch buffet i know exactly what i want to eat
chicken_tikka
the boneless chicken chunks in the creamy orange sauce
saag
spinch dip with extra butter
samosas
rice and naan
based of this
india_palace delivers a great lunch buffet
the food is refreshed regularly
frequency depends on how busy it is
and the quality has been consistent
my one gripe is that they never give you enough naan and make you wait when you request more
the restaurant as i mentioned is pretty nice
recently renovated and is great for large groups or more intimate meetings but the parking is terrible
service is average
they've messed up my check several times and i have had to call them out on it every time
remember the yelp_check_in for a free mango_lassie
only per table wtf
and the yelp_deal
sorry to say this is not a restaurant i would return to
we eat indian on are regular_basis
and i would say the food is average
maybe a bit above
however the main issue was the service
our waiter was extremely friendly
however we were there on a friday_night
and there was not a crowd
it was a best full
first
they had a full bar
but they were not serving drinks
apparently they sent the bartender out on a delivery
and no one else could mix drinks
why they did this on a friday_night is totally beyond me
we also had issues with the waiter
while friendly
both waiters i noticed spent the majority of the night on the phone
not taking orders
just talking
we struggled to get their attention when we needed to
and several things were missed on our order
food was extremely reasonable
however the service issues were simply too much for us to overcome
and thus we will not go back
ive been here times
not located in the best neighborhood but it doesnt bother me because when we walk in
its very clean and friendly
as we walked in
we saw a wall full of pictures and saw the owner photographed with some celebrities that have also been there
one that caught my eye was the celeb that played the host in slumdog millionaire
as they escorted us to our table
we get greeted_by waiters that remembered us from last time
there has been a lot of customers both times we have been there but still got amazing service
plus
my mother in law who is from england is very picky when it comes to food
before she left to england we took her to eat here
she loves indian food and brags about the indian food restaurants in england
but when my husband and i brought her here
she ate so much she couldnt stop saying how delicious it all was
the service has been super both times
we will be back
excellent indian food at a great price
if you are feeling overwhelmed by the strip and are looking for a quiet and delicious dining option go here
everything on the menu is soo good and the wait_staff are attentive and grateful
constant thank yous even when you are being waited on
garry is especially kind and knowledgable
if you put your order in his hands he will make sure you are happy
so what are you waiting for go eat here now
first off this review is for the so called 'customer service' here
so let me begin
my friend and i had been waiting all week to finally come to this spot to try indian for the first time
i had read all the great reviews about the chicken_tikka_masala and how good the garlic_naan was so we were pretty excited about it
as we entered we weren't really greeted politely
we were kind of looked at like we were lost
i asked the waiter if we could have a table for
so he pointed and said booth
so we walked to the nearest empty booth he was possibly referring to
we sat for about a couple minutes till the same waiter came over and said
you're here for the buffet right
we looked at each other confused because it was our first time there so i asked him if we were able to order from the menu
he looked annoyed and went over and grabbed a couple menus and brought them over
my friend and i were already set on ordering ourselves the chicken_tikka_masala because of the great reviews and the garlic_naan as well
we waited a few more minutes then a different waiter approached us and asked us if we were here for the buffet
i politely said no we are first timers and not too sure what was being served at the buffet
he then described all the choices
i asked if the chicken_tikka_masala was available and he had said no
i also had asked if the garlic_naan would be available at the buffet and he said no they would have to make it in the back and bring it out
he was really trying to push us to eat at the buffet but we were really set on trying the dish we wanted
so he took our order of chicken_tikka masalas and the garlic_naan
i then asked about the free_mango_lassi you receive if you check in on yelp
my friend and i both showed our check ins
then he says that only one person per table with a coupon gets a free_mango_lassi
which was not stated on the coupon or app that it only applies for person
so if you're going with a friend or friends
be prepared that only one of you will get a free_mango_lassi if you check in here
during the time while waiting for our order no one approaches us and let's us know our food will be ready soon
or to re fill our water cups or to check in on us at all
finally our food comes out and it's a pretty small bowl of the chicken_tikka_masala
a few small pieces of boneless chicken submerged in like ounces of their sauce and spices
but it smells delicious
then a basket of the naan which really wasn't much since we both shared two pieces each
and a bowl of rice to share between the both of us
i thought per order of a dish you get your own rice
but i thought wrong
food definitely stars
being a first timer i was satisfied
but for the price of bowls of chicken_tikka_masala
sharing a bowl of rice and an order of garlic_naan
which came out to be a little over each
i'm disappointed
not too sure if he had charged us the dinner price and gave_us a lunch size meal
all in all my friend and i both enjoyed the flavors of indian food for the first time
but will probably never come back here again
whoever heard of serving chicken masala without rice
an outrage
this place serves chicken masala in a bowl full of sauce and expects you to eat it without soaking up the sauce with rice
about halfway through my meal when i had little chicken and a lot of sauce left the waiter finally asked me if i wanted some rice
little did i know at the time that the rice
barely enough for two
would cost an extra
outrageous
i have never been to an india restaurant that didn't serve their dishes with rice on the side
but this one seems to want to soak you for every dollar they can get
decent food but at a steep price
i wont be back
my boyfriend and i went here because of a group on deal for dinner in which you spend and get off
overall the food took a bit longer than expected to receive
especially since it was slow night customers wise
however it was worth_the_wait
along with this they were good about refilling our drinks and clearing our plates at the end
plus they took the group on without issue
something i see a lot of restaurants trying to get out of when i use groupons of some kind
i love_this_place
the food is so fresh and cooked_to_perfection
it's difficult_to_find good indian food in las_vegas
so this restaurant is quite a gem
our waiter
manny
was just wonderful
very attentive and helpful
also
the coffee was fantastic
stars overall
i go to a lot of indian_restaurants
mostly in la
this is my first in vegas
food was okay
food
mixed veggie pakora
stars
not too oily so you don't feel too guilty
naan
stars
fluffy and yummy
this was actually really good here
chicken_tikka
stars
juicy and moist chicken
really good
i'd recommend this
mixed_vegetables
star
burnt vegetables
no flavor
i can't even believe they would serve this
the veggies were half black from being burnt
requested a scrambled egg curry
stars
was more of just dry scrambled eggs
didn't have a curry_sauce
we asked for a curry_sauce on the side and it made it taste better
service
stars
the guy helping us was really nice
listened to what we wanted and kept saying he understood our special requests but when the curry and sauces we requested came out they weren't what we wanted
so
i think he just thought he knew what we wanted
he did try though which was nice
atmosphere
stars
nice place on the inside
clean and spacious
they have long tables in the middle for big groups
and booths on the side
everything was alright
except when i presented the yelp coupon
the waiter gave a bad look
ps
the bill came to after the coupon
p
good food and huge menu
but service isn't always as responsive as it could be
i love this india restaurant
probably the best one in las_vegas
the prices_are_very_reasonable the service is awesome
i like how they always have indian music_videos playing for their customers also to show everyone what's the indian culture is about
i think they also do have a buffet for lunch for all u can eat
i have yet to try that but everytime i go there i get the chicken_biryani
my all time fav indian fried_rice
i also do recommend for all the new comers to try out the chicken_tikka_masala the shish kebabs
let_me_tell_you if u don't like spicy food u may have a problem eating here
but hey
u can also try mild but where the fun in that
overall i like the restaurant the food is delicious
a must try indian restaurant if u live or visiting_vegas
i took my cousin to try this place as she had never had indian before and was interested in trying it
she loved it
we ordered the chicken_tikka and a lamb_vindaloo
both were excellent
but the chicken_tikka was amazing
i was pleasantly_surprised to see my old friend vimil
vick
working here now
he took great care of us
i love the location of this place
right next_door to my favorite gay bar
i need to go back to try the lunch buffet
if you love indian food or have never tried it
i highly_recommend this place
ask for vick and he will help you figure_out what to order
loved this place
we went to this place on a saturday_night before a show and can't enough good things about this place
pros
awesome service very funny and down to earth
fantastic food
clean restrooms
fast service
and again
the food was terrific
loved the big screen tv and the indian music_videos nice_touch
cons
lady welcoming us at the front door could have smiled once or twice
but no big_deal
would definitely rinse and repeat
typical liars
i just went through a painstaking process of choosing items from their online menu for delivery only to be told
we dont deliver
i called them on their lie since they advertise that they do both online and on their_website
they even have an online delivery order tool
i got pissed
telling them how much time i wasted trying to order vegan for a big party
they admitted that they selectively didnt deliver tonight
then hung up on me
false advertising
they deserve to lose business
wow
found my new favorite indian_joint
the food here is amazing
i had dinner and ordered the korma chicken and lets just say i'm hooked
the flavor and texture of the dish was something i've never had before and i've been eating indian food for a while
the atmosphere is great open
nice well_stocked bar bollywood playing on several flat screens
i believe the owner is the bartender a russell peters look a like
lol the night i came there was a bus load of indian tourists but the restaurant was well planned in advance
prior to their arrival i would say there was a fairly large amount of indian locals so you know the food is good
the free_mango_lassi was a great compliment to our meal
garry our server is awesome and attentive
he's been there for years so be sure to ask for him to get the best service
all in all this place gets stars and despite the area it was still a safe place to park and not worry_about the surrounding area
ok
so i came back again and had deplorable service
the good food wasn't good enough for the slow
in attentive and at times rude staff
not to mention a side of regular
plain rice is
food was good
but the service was typical indian
not the best
would definitely recommend if you are close by and want to eat indian food
we don't eat much indian food
but this place was amazing
our waiter vick was excellent and took very good care of us
we let him select our meals for us
chicken_tika_masala and the lamb_rogan_josh
we highly_recommend this place
we were only ones there at
so we had the place to ourselves
i was craving_indian_food on our trip so i found this on yelp of course
the food was excellent
vick was awesome and if i get back to vegas
i will visit again
awsome food and best service
man
i think we just beat the rush
of us took a cab over here on sunday evening for a quiet
off strip meal
the yelp_reviews spoke highly of this place so why not
we grabbed our free mango lassies with the check in and also purchased the for deal as we sat_down
oddly our waiter was a little cold when he took our drinks order but by the end of the evening he was all smiles and jokes
the food portions were healthy without being obnoxious
though the place was largely empty when we stepped in around
by the time we left
there were a good people lined up for the buffet
clearly a popular choice
best indian restaurant hands_down
ask for gary for star service
vegan friendly
great selection of indian beers
haywards and flying horse my top picks
great food
great service
our server garry was extremely helpful with helping us with the menu selections
everyone was friendly
food was amazing
i went in to indian palace last week while visiting las_vegas and went to this place all days either for lunch or dinner
the food was very authentic
service was great
highly_recommend this place for folks who like traditional_indian
punjabi
food
i've eaten here twice
the first time was for the lunch buffet and this was before they remodeled
the food was delicious
so i went again during dinner
what
a
mess
for a place nestled in a shadier neighborhood
i didn't think reservations would be necessary
when we came in
we were seated at a table that still had remnants and water glasses from the last diners
we kept trying to flag a server down
but no one would even look our way
i'm very patient
but not minutes of no service patient
i usually give places servers the benefit of the doubt
but it was absolutely ridiculous even after we flagged someone and they said someone would be right with us
i've never walked out of a restaurant due to bad service or even bad food
but one can only wait so long
if my memory wasn't tarnished by that experience
i'd try the place again
otherwise
this place needs to be aware of their diners
i won't be going back again
good food
do not get rasmalai
i have been to india five times and love indian food
this place is fantastic
the menu has several things that are not usually on the menu
vada
dosa
goat dishes and ground chicken
we started_off_with papadum served with three fragrant dipping_sauces coriander chutney
chili chutney and tamarind
i was already sold
each one was flavorful and pungent
we then moved on to an all vegetarian meal
the dahi vada
lentil cake with yogurt and tamarind
were to die for moist
with a thin aromatic sauce
they are often dry with a heavy sauce not here
we also has malai_kofta
which was also delicious
aloo tikka with channa
and bindi masala
okra
i cannot say enough good things
we were three people and we had a lot of leftovers to take home
our waiter was garry and he was all smiles and so appreciative that we liked the food
i can't_wait_to_go_back
it was our first time at india_palace and it was a terrific experience
vick was a great server with recommendations and very attentive
we will_definitely_return
this place is a bomb
their food is times better than those hotel buffet costing
it has a great collection of legitimate indian foods ranging_from south to north india
and we got a deal on living_social
for
plus free_mango_lassi on yelp
what a dope deal
if you want to save money on food and party more
this is a place to go
best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
our waiter vick was amazing
i have celiac disease and cannot eat gluten
he took excellent care of us
i wish i could bring him and the food back to reno with me
after watching the movie
life of pi on blu ray
i was craving_for_indian_food
found this place thanks to groupon
my friend and i decided to hit up this place after she was done drunk shopping at fashion show mall
lol
came around for dinner
right after we sat_down
there was an influx of customers for dinner
whew
got the orders in and didn't have to wait long
ordered the following
appetizer combo samosa
aloo_tikki
veggie
chicken and paneer_pakora
this was the first plate that came out
duh
it's an appetizer
it's pretty decent and sharing it with two people is good enough
i enjoyed the samosa and the paneer_pakora the most
chicken_tikka_masala and fish tikka masala with plain basmati_rice
ok
so the entree is where my heart somewhat melts
got them both at medium spicy
it was too much gravy yyy and not enough meat
meat gravy ratio
bottom_line
i would hit up this place again
but would try the lunch buffet
because the groupon wasn't allowed to use for lunch buffet
we went for normal entree menus
and glad_we_did
items selected
masala_dosa
thin crispy rice crepes filled with deliciously spiced potatoes onions
chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori white chicken marinated in yogurt spices
simmered in a creamy tomato sauce
mango_lassi
check in bonus
for dosa
my all time favorite has been http
www
dosasf
com in sf
but india_palace does it in a different way
more crispy and lighter
which was really good
chicken_tikka_masala was also very good
and the naan was tasty
for basic items
execution is everything and they did quite well
fresh and hot
no stale leftovers we usually see in lunch buffet were observed
i'll return for the dosa
lunch buffet was decent but i know three other indian_restaurants within a mile that have food that is better than anything i ate here
great service and delicious food
definitely will be back for more of that vegetarian dinner special and garlic_naan
love coming here one of my favorite indian_restaurants in las_vegas
everytime i've come here i've had excellent service
gary has been out server the past several times and he always makes our time enjoyable
hands_down this food is amazing
i love atmosphere here as well
very refreshing
worth_the_drive from summerlin each time
i'll be continuing to come here when i crave authentic_indian_food
this was such tasty punjabi food
i just loved it
we were visiting with family from india and even if my taste_buds have changed a lot living here
they said this was the best that they have seen so far
the place got really crowded soon after we were seated that did not frazzle them a bit
service was awesome
food arrived in no time and in all one of my best experiences for indian food in a place filled with visitors
can't_wait_to_go_back
decided to go vegetarian with couple of friends and ordered malai_kofta
matter_paneer
baigan bhartha and all three items were excellent
the bread basket was great value and nans were perfect
service by garry was awesome
we will be back soon
we went in with little expectations
food was absolutely_delicious
we tried the buffet
the spread was generous and at a pretty affordable pre tax
would highly_recommend paneer saag and the masala chai
my jam
we've been coming to india_palace for the past years
and though we've tried two other indian_restaurants_in_town closer to where we live
we always come back and make that minute drive because it is the best
service wise
meaning the
friendliness
of the servers
is hit_or_miss
but that is me being nit picky
they always bring us what we need
we never have to wait for drink or naan refills
and i come for the food not the the smiles
i recommend_this_place to everyone i know
we purchased a living_social deal for credit on a recent trip_to_vegas i gotta say
i would_definitely_go_back even without the deal
pros
the food
reasonably_priced
these were more than enough for two people
we had leftovers ordered extra naan for later
lamb_rogan_josh
plain basmati_rice
chicken_tikka_masala
garlic_naan
their free mango drink when you check in is soooo goood
cons
nothing really
just the service was a little slow
they had a private party going on in another room
but our server
garry
was great
basically
worth checking out
bomb indian food
entertaining music_videos on tv
friendly_staff
don't let the sketchy area keep you away
the food pisses amazing
i've been twice and had the goat_curry both times
i actually stabbed my dinner partner in the hand when he reached for a bite
the cheese bread is so good and is perfect with the green mint sauce
the staff is excellent at describing the dishes and both times they have brought me samples from the kitchen at no charge
i would have given stars if not for the fact i found hair in my goat the last time i visited
it ended the meal
i but i will likely be back for more
i'll just hope there are hairnets back in the kitchen
this restaurant
in a small shopping plaza
features the cuisine of both india and nepal
we shared traditional nepalese entrees of chili_chicken and meat momo as recommended by max jacobsen
the waiter asked how spicy would we like our chili_chicken indian spicy was my reply
wow call the fire department we are talking smoking hot
each order of meat momo order includes momos
i love that word
which are steamed dumplings stuffed with ground turkey and vegetables
we also ordered naan
mango_lassis
yogurt based beverages
and desserts
khir and lal mohan
the former is basmati_rice in milk with raisins and nuts and the latter is similar to or the same as gulab_jamun
but a bit denser
good restaurant with mediocre at best service and decor
the food was good
a mixure of indian and nepalese food
the curries were quite tasty and naan was great
however
i was expecting more nepalese and himalayan food and less more traditional_indian food fare
however
all in all cuisine aspect of the place is definitely above_average
service was poor
we came in for an early dinner
around pm
and the place was empty
a few nepalese gentleman
friends of the owner
i presume
were sitting together talking business and writing stuff on notepad right in front of the customers not professional
that would have been okay
but to top it off
one of the managers
or possibly the owner was also serving the tables and was quite slow with water drink refills and was very rude in questions about different
unfamiliar menu_items
he even had a smirk on his face a couple_of_times
the tables were unimpressive and some of the booths were ripped in places and patched together with tape
overall
for me to return to this place
i would have to make sure that the server manager was not there that day and that it was busier so i do not have to see creepy business conversations
but
i may come back and recommend_this_place for unique and tasty food
good food and a surprisingly sophisticated beer_and_wine menu
have yet to have something there that wasn't delicious
hit the lunch buffet for a nice selection of what they have to offer or order off the descriptive
and slightly humorously written
menu
if you like it hot
and i mean hot
this is one of the few places i have been to in a while that will make it hot enough for me
don't be afraid to say so
they will accommodate you
however
if they suggest a heat_level for a dish
my experiences there are to listen to them and enjoy the subtle nuances that too much spicy might cover
you can always ask for something spicy on the side if you want to heat it up
be sure to check what the specials are
often unique and tasty
good variety and a place that can accommodate your vegan and vegetarian friends
as well
head there for happy_hour
can't remember the exact time
and enjoy the two for one beer prices
they have a diverse selection from around the world
including some great belgian style ales as well as a couple of organic brews
or try the ginger energy tea
just the thing to pick you up
edit
the place in under new management
wasn't happy w the food or service the last time i was there
hard to get them to make it hot nemore
i know they have a different chef than when i gave my first review
will give it another shot
but it isn't the same place as it was
edit
went again last friday
food was lackluster
not bad
but not at all what it was
sad that the place that used to have awesome flavor and spice served me two bland entrees
would drop it to two stars if it didn't have a decent price
and one of my friends did like one of the two things she got
edit
they're back
very happy to say that the food has been really good the past couple_of_times i have been there
and the lunch buffet is still good and reasonably_priced
thumbs_up
went to the lunch buffet here and everything was pretty forgettable
i agree with everything carly said
except for the cute waiter part
no point in coming_back here when there so many better indian_lunch_buffets
i enjoyed dinner here a lot the service was outstanding with lots of suggestions and guidance
i ordered the mango chicken
how spicy on a scale of to
asked our waiter
being a volcano and being a babbling brook
i ummm and then ordered
that was a modestly spicy curry with a sweet tang to it just as promised
the stuffed paratha has some potato and peas
but not enough for my indian colleague's liking
this place is also a hidden_gem for beer
the beer menu_is_extensive
but there were also an additional beers recently added
take a look before you choose
said our waiter as he pointed to the table with beer bottles on
so i did
and came back with a pint bottle of belgian lager
very nice with my mango chicken
try this place
i didn't try the buffet
all in all
the portions are good my colleague and i shared the curry and rice and we had paratha each
i had a beer too and the bill was incl tip
the decor isn't as nice as the nepalese place in pasadena
ca
but it's pleasant enough
our taxi driver didn't know the name of this place but he'd seen it
but
considering vegas isn't necessarily a place of culture it's no bad thing if himalayan is a little obscure and off the beaten track
i love indian food
it has by far surpassed mexican food on my list of food i could eat daily
unfortunately my boyfriend
who i spend the majority of my time with
does not feel the same
in fact
he specifically asks that we do not have indian food when i am choosing the restaurant
so consider my complete elation when he suggested i look up an indian food restaurant to go to while visiting las_vegas
after looking online
not on yelp
for some reason
i decided on himalayan cuisine
and jesus were we happy
they took reservations
i appreciate this because very few restaurants in sacramento do
it is off the strip
look
dining on the strip is typically expensive
annoying and tasteless
i was hoping that this place would be where the locals go and it was
the food was fantastic
my boyfriend loved his dish
the waiter and the owner both suggested fantastic wine and appetizers and my dish was spicy and delicious
the coconut dessert is absolute heaven
and i don't like coconut
the owner is amazing
not only was he friendly and took his time recommending wine to us
he brought us out a sample of his favorite wine and even toasted with us
by the end of the evening we were inviting him to the double down for a drink
this place was absolutely wonderful
we left with full bellies
lucky beer and a special discount on our next bill
oh yes
we will be back
update
new decor
bigger restaurant
same fabulous beer menu
same silly menu
but the name has changed and there's now a lunch buffet
sadly
the new lunch buffet is almost all indian food with little himalayan or nepalese
but
this is one of the best indian_restaurants in vegas
and i'd even put it up there with some of the best indian food in the san_francisco bay_area
this ain't your typical greasy indian buffet
the food is fresh and delicious
this is one of the best budget restaurants_in_town and my old review gave them stars
but i'm adding another star for the new
beautiful decor
old review
why go to a himalayan restaurant and get indian food
maybe it's because this place has been under new ownership for about months but at least half the menu is nepalese himalayan food
yes
there is indian food on the menu
but i didn't eat any of it and you don't have to either unless you want to
there is no lunch buffet anymore
we had the nepalese sampler platter
split one between two of us which was plenty of food for a not heavy dinner
and it was wonderful
the only thing that looked even remotely indian was the dessert
we had some kind of black eyed pea dhal ish kind of thing that was a bit bland but still nourishing and tasty
a cucumber
potato
cilantro salad was one of the tastiest things i've_ever_eaten
the lamb was scrumptious
i'm not huge on chicken but it was pretty good
there was some kind of bamboo shoot salad that was oddly compelling
no clue what was in it
and the momo
oh man it is all about the momo
i could eat these tasty dumplings all day long
phenomenal beer_selection
friendly owner
great food
if you like spice
don't ask for
the was really quite mild
rarely do i find myself in gastrointestinal distress
but after a gigantic four course dinner the night before with many glasses of booze and servings of meat the size of my head
my poor tum was crying uncle and all i wanted was something fibrous and unadulterated by animal products
i'm a bit biased because i know the owner of the joint
but i don't think he would have served me any less of a fantastic meal had i been some schmo off the strip
i ate a gingered daal
smoky green beans and potatoes
chickpeas and spinach
and cauliflower in a yogurt_sauce accompanied_by a mango_lassi and was perfectly happy
although i am not a big drinker
rajan loves his alcomohol and keeps fabulous and strange beverages for your pleasure
of both the brew and grape variety
heck
if i'm not going to drink it
you may as well
but hands off that dessert wine
visited vegas this week with my boyfriend and his coworkers and it was our pleasure to take them to this place
again
fantastic service
great food and fully bellies
the waiter had us all laughing and talking and the food had us in a bit of a coma
thank you thank you and we will be back again
this is my favorite indian place in town
their food is very tasty and well spiced and the naan_bread is hot and crisp
the service is attentive
unfortunately they don't have the lunch buffet anymore
the food was not exceptional
just good solid vegetarian indian food but wait
the tibetan food was really good
and i hadn't seen a lot of it before
the sauces were a little underspiced
and the vegetables a little not varied enough
but i still definitely recommend_this_place
its menu has a lot of attitude and wonderfully designates all the dishes which can be made vegan i really appreciated this
the only really downside of the dinner was the owner
who was chatty to an extreme as we were trying to leave
i recommend the channa_masala and the tibetan dish similar to yakisoba
i like this place and dine there frequently
it's almost always quiet and empty
which i like
the menu is cleverly written and the food has never disappointed me
try the makhani
service can be a little uneven
sometimes they will bring dishes without serving spoons
or present a shared appetizer without plates so you have to ask for them
at times i've had to flag them down to get the check
sometimes the kitchen is a little odd
the menu says the tomato_soup has paneer
but i recently ordered it and it came without it
so i had them redo it
i was there again last week and as i was ordering the soup i asked about this
and had to point to the menu where it says the soup has paneer
no really
it says paneer
i like paneer
bring it to me with the paneer
i am a little worried about them
however
they used to have the biggest beer_list in las_vegas
but now if you want to order beer
they are out of stock of almost everything on the list
they point you to a table where you can look at what is available
and i'd guess there are less than ten selections
not a good sign that they are not sticking to the brand promise of an amazing beer_list
times are tough i guess
and no one wants to order expensive inventory that is going to sit
let's get right into this
the service is adequate
i haven't really tried napalese food
but i thought it was okay
the place looked comfortable
the server was a bit slow at times even though there were hardly any people
i also tried a few of the indian food
and it was also decent
i've only tried this place in las_vegas for indian food
but i don't think it's up there compared_to_other indian food i've had in other states
however
it was ok even though i think the prices could be better
this is a wonderful place for vegetarians
and all the more so since vegetarians don't get too many great options in las_vegas
the food is varied
delicious
and healthy
the prices_are_pretty reasonable for the high_quality of food
for visitors
i'll start by saying that this is slightly over a mile off the strip
so in most weather you'll need to drive
however my wife and i walked down from bellagio on new year's day and the weather was perfect
both sunny and cool
and it was about minutes walk in each direction
note that this food is nepali food
not indian
if you go expecting it to taste exactly like indian
you'll be disappointed
as an indian from silicon valley
i'll say that i like nepali food a lot
because it has more delicate spices and seasonings
it's a whole lot less oily
and it's hard_to_find around where i live
in particular
i like the food here better than what i get in most indian_restaurants in my area
even the popular ones
we tried the vegan sampler platter for two
and were not disappointed
there was a mixed bean and lentil soup called kwati that had a delightful smoky flavor
there were a few other curries including a garbanzo spinach combination and a potato cauliflower combination
each had its own different flavor and all the ingredients tasted fresh
loved it
all this came on a plate with whole_wheat bread and rice
we also had samosas as appetizers
and they were good though not spectacular like the rest
we had hot tea
a tasty organic variety
rather than wine
but next time i'm going to try something from the intriguing wine_list
we left happy and well filled
though not heavy because the food was not rich
of course
your mileage may vary
and you might find it bland
also i can't comment on the non vegetarian food
we intentionally ordered our food mild because we wanted to taste the seasoning and spices
and it was a good choice for us
you can order it spicy if you like your chilies
overall
i enthusiastically recommend this restaurant for vegetarians visiting las_vegas
and meat_eaters can try it too if they get tired of the steakhouses and the seafood buffets
it's a great pity i only found it on the last day of our trip
otherwise i'd have skipped one of the buffets and eaten here twice
it was excellent
i was a little embarassed because i couldn't remember what the yogurt drink i like was called
lassi
and couldn't find it on the menu
but they new what i was talking_about and brought it right away
it was all fabulous
we will_definitely_return
i went here with my uncle and his girlfriend when they visited from california
my uncle liked the weekend thali special because it included a complimentary glass of champagne
his girlfriend liked it because it was all_you_can_eat
i liked it because even the thali special wasn't bad
one of the dishes
the lentil soup
left a great deal to be desired
but everything else was fresh and tasty
when the lunch_special is mostly good and nothing makes you shudder
then the regular menu is usually superb
i also like that they do a lunch wallah card delivery service to unlv
i might consider it next semester
went to this restaurant because my brother saw a lot of
recession special
ads on billboards and since he was craving_for_indian_food
we ended_up going there for his birthday brunch
presentation was good
portions were on the
smaller
side but then again
majority of indian food comes that size
we had the lamb kurma
tandori_chicken
and several folks in my party had the
all_you_can_eat
the place was packed for a saturday afternoon and there was only poor waiter running around pouring water
taking orders
cleaning tables
and he was probably the cook too 'cause we waited and waited and waited for our food
not being too
graphic
hours after brunch
i wasn't feeling too great
later that day when i told my brother
he said
oh
i forgot to tell you that last week when we tried to come for lunch
the health department shut it down due to some
pipes issues
supposedly
nice
bro
happy
bday
the best indian restaurant ive been to
i am not a big_fan of indian food
this is the only indian restaurant i ever enjoy
ive been to different indian restaurant and do not like indian food
if your a vegetarian
this is the place and it is awesome for you
i am not
i did enjoy there yellow curry and clossal shrimp dish
the price is fair
lunch deal is excellent
the service is friendly and have excellent selection of beer_and_wine
great food at a good price
in las_vegas this is not easy_to_find
this is not generic indian food
the menu is varied
creative and will please both vegetarians and carnivores
the service was friendly and good
the restaurant is being remodeled and said it will have a lassi bar
walking miles in las_vegas in degree weather may have not been such a great idea but walking to himalayan cuisine was
since i didn't want to have indian food that i could eat anywhere_else
i opted to try something from tibet or nepal
since their lunch_specials were mostly indian
i ordered from the menu
the tibetan nepalese section was rather sparse in comparison to the indian section and chose one of two vegan_options
i ordered the chau_chau which was a flavorful blend of noodles and vegetables with chili paste
the dish was pretty good though i wish there was more variety than just noodles and was happy that i chose the half order which was sufficient enough to fill my stomach and left me craving for dessert
the half order was similarly priced as the lunch_special
they offered one vegan dessert option which was absolutely_amazing
i tried the gajar haluwa which is a carrot
pudding
that consisted of carrots chopped up very small and sweetened by its own juices mixed with raisins
apparently nuts were also in the
pudding
though i didn't see any
their red tea peach iced_tea was also delicately sweetened and refreshing for the hot weather
the atmosphere is alright
it is a lot more casual than it looks on their_website
their right wall is under construction pending a lassi bar and they use paper napkins instead of fancy napkins
i can only hope that the lassi bar will include some non dairy options
i just love the food here
for the time being i honestly think this is the best place to get indian himalayan food in town
they are doing some big renovations right at this moment but when it's done they will have their_lunch_buffet open
i think it will be pretty nice on the inside once they finish
but for now you have to deal with the black tarp that divides the place up
i have eaten there two times in the last week and a hand full of times a year or so ago
i will say the food is much better this time around
i brought my family and we tried several dishes and everything was great
i ate there again yesterday and still consistently great
oh almost forgot
they offer a good amount of vegan_options and organic ingredients
half of my family are vegans
the food and service is great here
it's much fancier than the older version
looks like they're revamping the interior
but i was most floored when i saw the words
vegan
and
organic
on menu_items
i had to do a double take
and was pretty skeptical while awaiting my dish but was pleasantly_surprised the food was fresh
not too salty
perfectly seasoned
oh_yeah
it's about indian i recommend_this_place for indian food too
ps
try the rose balls
don't remember the actual name on the menu
they are the donuts thingys flavored with rose water
i've tried these many times in different cities but these are hands_down the most delectable
this place is so good
the best place to get indian food in las_vegas and the food is slightly cheaper_than other_indian_places
and get this
you get the rice for free
omg
what your not gonna charge me ten dollars for basic white rice which
is almost should be an inalienable right like freedom
the makhani with vegetables is delicious
malia kofta is creamy
and not to rich and the kofta balls are nice and fresh
the saag tastes super fresh
not like canned spinach
the beers are on the pricey side but
i tried the kingfisher beer and enjoyed it immensely
i got a mango_lassi for dessert and it was delicious
the food is good here
got the
lsd
which is lamb in some spicy sauce
sorry not an indian nepalese food expert
and i believe there is a hint of curry
it was served with something reminiscent of grits and a green leafy vegetable
i tried the mango drink
surprisingly good
i definitely liked how low key it is and the server was polite
i went to this place last week with my sister and two other people who have never tried indian food
and we all loved it
we had the indian sampler for and the vertical vindaloo and it was all delicious
the sampler
one other entree and extra order of naan was enough for the of us
the service was also great
i definitely would recommend_this_place_to_anyone who wanted to try indian or even just something different
how wonderful to find this place off rainbow
chris
the owner
who is always working
is wonderful
and makes a point to great all guests
and visit the tables to say hello and make you feel appreciated
inside decor is still being worked on
but even in mid decoration
it's a nice_atmosphere
great beer_list with good prices
try the pirate with an amazing flavour you definitely get your money's worth on that one
everything we tried there was wonderful
the chau_chau
sp
chicken
the lamb_vindaloo
chicken_biryani
chicken chili
naan
mango_ice_cream
fabulous
and the yogurt topping is fantastic a definite must with the spicy dishes
servings are well presented
all come with superb rice
and generous portions
great service
wonderful food
and decent prices
entrees ranged from
and the lunch buffet is a steal for
mmmmm
i only wish i lived closer
or
even better
that chris will open up a mint in san diego
having recently been burned by overpriced terrible tasting food at another indian restaurant in the area cough bollywood cough we were hesitant to try more indian_cuisine
we were having a tough time coming up with a new place to visit so i went to yelp
i started looking up various ethnic cuisines and i did a search for nepalese food
much to my surprise a place called mint_indian_bistro showed_up
after reading the reviews it seemed like the place had a mix of himalayan and northern indian_cuisine
so we made a resolution
we'll try some appetizers and if we didn't like it we would go to a different restaurant for our main meal
all that plan b contingency stuff went out the window when i looked at the menu
they actually had menu_items marked as vegan and vegetarian such that for once i would not have to ask about the ingredients they use in each of the dishes
so we made the plunge
we decided to share the vegan sampler and it was good
i want to say it was great
but there were a couple of items in the sampler that i did not enjoy as much as the rest
additionally the decor and feel of the restaurant was very nice
they even turned the lights up for us temporarily while we were perusing the menu so my mother could see the menus as she squinted without her reading glasses again
with full disclosure and all that jazz i would say the food was in the four star range
but the addition of the vegan friendly menu really pushes the rating up for me into the five_star range
i gotta help promote any vegan friendly place here in vegas because they are not as prevalent as they are in other towns
nice and casual
foods are not super salty and greasy
kids friendly too
great quality food
much better than when it was himilayan cuisine
love that we got a free good quality mimosa w our weekend buffet
price not unreasonable
food was amazing
delicious chicken pakora
like indian chicken fingers
chicken_tikka_masala
tamarind rice and spinach w chickpeas
my husband is vegan and there were some nice options for him too
will go back again soon
i have been coming here since
before it was named mint_bistro
it was called himilayan napalese cuisine
they used to not have a lunch buffet
the lunch buffet is great
i go to unlv and i used to come here often for lunch
the owners are really nice
they food is really flavorful
they try to change the entrees up as often as possible
there is always chicken tandoori
and kheer
which is all that i need to make me happy
sometimes they have saag
and it's so delicious
the music is nice and the ambiance is very pleasant
they have vegan and vegetarian_dishes and an assortment of appetizers that go really well with mint_chutney
they also have fresh fruit and salad
it is well worth the
this place serves halal meats which is a plus if_you_are_looking for a zabihah restaurant
the chikken tikka masala
chicken tandoori
and lamb_vindaloo were all very good as was the naan
bhaji
and yogurt
kheer
indian rice_pudding
was also very good
the indian dishes that we tried were among some of the best indian items we had tried
i recommend the indian dinner plate special
which is and contains about or items to be shared with another person
every time i visit las_vegas i must without fail eat at mint_indian_bistro
because i believe it's one of the best indian_restaurants in the country
i say this after having sampled the vegetarian food selection at over a hundred indian_restaurants in about a dozen major cities over the past two decades
the diversity
freshness
and flavor of the nepali indian vegetarian food at mint is unmatched
i usually order the lumbini platter
which is vegan
this is not cheap at and others may simply wish to try the lunch buffet instead
but for those willing to try the vegan platter
let me say that it's health food that tastes like gourmet food
the meal comes with rice
whole_wheat roti
a mixed lentil daal with a tantalizing smoky flavor
a few different vegetable combinations each with their own unique flavor
and a carrot pudding for dessert
on my last visit chris
the owner
who has become a friend_of_mine
recommended i try the soy mango_lassi afterward
and being in an adventurous mood i tried it and was very happy with the result
what makes the food at mint so different is that the flavors of all the ingredients come out in a delightful blend and dance on your palate
because unlike most indian_restaurants
the chef here is sparing with the chili powder
uses oil in carefully controlled amounts
and uses different spice combinations in each dish
as a result you eat to your heart's content
enjoy every bite
remember the delicious curries mom cooked at home
if you're from india
and end up feeling like you've done your body a favor with all that nutrition
this restraunt provided a less than mediocre expereience on new year eve
there were long hairs in the noodles and the desert smelt like days old
donot get there and be cheated
i'm not aware of better indian restaurant's
but certainly this one is hopeless
not much to say here i liked the food
which was tasty and reasonably_priced
service was very slow
however
it took about minutes to receive our order quite surprising since there were only two other tables occupied
and it was only
pm
bottom_line
if you're in a hurry
go elsewhere
if not
stay and enjoy
the five star_rating is for dinner
i would drop a star for lunch
the dinner was perfectly_cooked
we had a combination of indian and nepalese dishes
amazing shrimp dish
service was excellent
fast enough
for indian food
and customized for my needs
extremely spicy
the lunch buffet on_the_other_hand was very mild and some even bland with a lot of sweet options
which i guess is to be expected with the audience for the lunch buffet but i and my wife was not super happy at lunch
this is a good option if you are in vegas with a car and would like to get away from the crazy buffets and try some real food
there's two kinds of indian food
the greasy comfort variety or the savory
authentic kind
as this place also serves himalayan dishes
one will find the food here is quite pleasantly the non greasy
delicious kind
and if vegetarian and vegan dishes are your thing
it will be even better
all the items on the menu are clearly marked and the waiters are very receptive to questions
the pakora and the paratha is so tasty
as well as the chau_chau
also
there is a great variety of beers
all the good things everyone has said are true
it's not on the strip
which is great
since it means it's not ridiculously crowded
the lassi bar is a great innovation
and the thandai lassi with vodka is awesome
we asked for all our dishes extra_spicy
but while they were pretty great
they weren't spicy at all
i've known this to happen before to some of my friends at indian_restaurants when the server makes a size you up decision that you can't_handle it
but really
this time they should have concluded that we can
given a
we were indian
b
we kept repeating about how much we loved spicy food
oh well
minor nitpick aside
the food is pretty great
especially some of the nepalese dishes
which are pretty rare
i've only been able to find one restaurant in chicago
if i ever decide that going down on vegas junkets to behave outrageously and pretend you're exempt from all rules becomes a regular habit
mint will be a regular lunch spot too
my bf and i were looking for a place a tad more upscale than getting the concierge service at the penny slots at el cortez and yelp led us to a veggie friendly eating place with a touch of class the was not on the godforsaken strip
we both love indian food
so mint seemed like the right choice
i was first pleased to see that we were the only folks there that didn't appear to be of indian ancestry
my personal good sign indicator for ethnic fooderies
i was also pleased to see that it was pretty packed
but there was no wait to be seated
the decor was simple and elegant
with lots of blond wood and high backed booths
service was spectacular
we had at least very attentive and polite servers
they kept us up to date on the progress of each course
made sure our water was cold and plentiful
and inquired about our enjoyment
the menu was extensive
with both himyl and indian dishes
there was a lot of creativity involved
but the old standbys were also delish
i also liked that the menu let diners know what was veggie vegan friendly
say yes to the samosas my friends
they are the best i have had
all dishes were at a fair price
and i really liked that you could order half dishes at a reduced cost
this was especially important when you have no microwave in your hotel
and you were taught not to waste food
me and the bf were really pleased with our dishes
and two half plate entrees were more than enough food to share and be stuffed but not too stuffed due to the half portions
i may also have to mention that they serve frambois
and i would cut someone to have that delicious fizzy nectar
this is the place that inspired me to yelp
i knew after seeing a yelp approved sticker in the window
that these reviews actually make an impact
yelpers
you got gooooood taste
so
thank you fellow yelpers on leading us here
and thanks mint for being so rad
i ordered take out from here not too long ago and i will_never_go_back
i don't know who does the cooking but they need to stop immediately
we ordered the chicken kadhai
vertical vindaloo
with chicken
and boneless lamb kabobs
the chicken dishes were both excessively oily and god only knows what part of the chicken they used
i specifically asked for breast meat and that i would even pay a few extra for it
the guy said no problem
i came home and opened the containers and saw this dark
muscle ridden meat sitting in front of me
both chicken dishes looked exactly the same even though they're supposedly different styles
the kabobs were horrible
huge pieces of lamb that were nowhere near tender
to top it all off
it was for dishes
some naan and rice
i will never visit this place again
i can make better indian dishes at home
excellent food
attention to detail
service and beer_list
wow
we wish mint was in our home town
the menu was fantastic and caters to all diets
we loved our visit to mint
i went here a few days_ago because it's like miles away from my house
this place has been a few different restaurants in the few years i've lived on this side of town
it was a himalayan restaurant
and now it's indian restaurant
the decor inside is very basic
moss green walls
some black iron pieces on the walls but was largely devoid of cultural ambiance that i particularly like in ethnic restaurants
i feel like decor really adds to an experience
it makes it feel authentic
this place didn't really have that
it was new
so maybe that's why it was so sparsely decorated
i took someone here because they never tried indian before
so we just ordered the indian sampler
the indian sampler had about pint sized versions of coconut curry vegetables
lamb_vindaloo
chicken masala
lentils
tandoori_chicken
yoghurt
kheer
and one other that i can't remember
it was accompanied_by pieces of sliced garlic_naan and basmati_rice
the coconut curry veggies were fantastic
the flavors were excellent
the lamb_vindaloo was good
not great
not as spicy as i'm used to
but not bad
the tandoori_chicken was kind of a joke
it looked like two cornish game hen legs
so micro chicken legs
i thought that looked horrible
we ordered lychee lassi and mango_lassi
and for whatever reason i was served lukewarm mango_lassi
i've never received lassi that wasn't cold
so it was a little different for me since the lychee lassi was served over ice
the service was good
no complaints on that
the owner chatted with us a little and was friendly
all in all
it was okay
it wasn't great
the price points are lower than origin india
so i'd go back if i wanted to pay something a little more moderate
the experience was fun
nothing mind blowing
origin india just blows it out of the water as far as the quality of the food and ambiance though
so i'd much rather go there if i had a choice
after a long day at a convention at the las_vegas convention center
my husband and i we looking for a nearby restaurant off the strip
we needed to decompress from an excited
yet stressful day
fortunately
we found mint_indian_bistro
a mile south of the lvcc
we shared the indian sampler
around
which was incredibly flavorful and delicious
our friendly servers
rajeev and biru
who are from nepal
gave_us a lesson on the similarities and differences between nepalese and indian cuisines
something we found intriguing
when we're traveling
we typically like to try different restaurants during our stay
however
we made an exception and came back to try mint indian bistro's all_you_can_eat buffet the next day
rajeev's and biru's hospitality coupled with the food we enjoyed made that an easy choice
when i return to vegas
i'll definitely come back to mint_indian_bistro
lunch_special buffet for
hell yes
best indian lunch buffet around
with dishes also set out for vegetarians and vegans
it is a little smaller than most buffets i have been to
but there is still a great selection
i got the chicken tandoori and tikka masala
tried a bit of the goat_curry
and pretty much ate up the vegetarian half of the buffet as well
overall
an excellent steal for the price
the standout for me was the kheer
it was some of the best i had
i also tried a mango_custard which was delicious
i would say it's a must if you are in the area or would like some indian for lunch
i work across_the_street from mint
so it is our go to lunch place for vegans
vegetarians
and meatavores
however
reading the other reviews
i really need to check it out for dinner sometime
i'm quite pleased with their buffet because a
it is cheaper_than most at only
b
it has lots of clearly marked vegan_options
and c
unlv dri employees get off
yay
cheaper
more stuff
plus a discount
sold
we go there so much that the staff puts in a order of vegan roti for me as soon as we walk in the door
which is sweet
the service is usually very attentive
filling drinks
etc
apparently they will even make vegans a special version of the vegetarian_dishes on the buffet if you ask
i never even thought to try this until i saw some other vegan customers do it
between the kwaati
deliciously spiced bean soup
mixed veggie pakoras
chau_chau
nepalese noodle dish
two kinds of rice
daal
and usually vegan entrees
i was never really hurting for options
they also have a great beer_selection that i never get to try since i go at lunch
going to make a dinner trip there a priority
one of the best indian food experiences i've ever had
we started with the veggie momo
dumplings
based_on the level of saltiness i'm pretty sure they came out of a package but i appreciated they were steamed and not fried
the chutney that came with them for dipping certainly upstaged their flaws as did the courses to follow
we ordered a couple different variations on naan
bread
and they were hot and delicious
obviously right out of the oven
i ordered the chicken curry and the bread came in very handy to soak up all the sauce
i'm not sure what my friend ordered but it was wonderfully sweet
savory and spicy
the kind of heat that creeps up on you and makes you want to eat more of it
the waitstaff was very friendly_and_attentive
they had a good selection of indian beer
one thing i noticed was how cleverly the food descriptions were written on the menu
the imaginative and vibrant language made it difficult to decide what to order because everything sounded amazing
if you'd like to venture off the strip for something exotic i'd recommend this restaurant
not a big_fan of buffets but i love me some chicken_tikka_masala
the only problem i had was some of the items in the buffet were out and or there wasn't any chicken left in it and it was just sauce and they really didn't replace it but whatever was available was pretty good the bread was good to
i just left this indian_bistro and overall i was very pleased with my experience
the food was well prepared and the presentation was clean and simple
the vertical vindaloo curry is delicious as is the cream and tomato based curry
the second dish listed under indian entrees
the service was friendly_and_attentive
i will_be_returning to this great vegas find
mint offers a somewhat small but very tasty lunch buffet
the cuts of meat used were of fantastic quality for an indian restaurant and all the food was enjoyable
i really enjoyed some of the different touches like a coconut_chutney and indian soup options which i've_never_seen before on a buffet
my only small criticism is i felt some of the seasoning lacked a little of the subtlety i have experienced at some of my favourite indian_restaurants and that keeps mint just a tiny bit lower on the pecking order for me
the curries carried that hint of acrid taste where you can taste all the individual spices rather than having them deftly blend into a combined taste
this is a very minor quibble as the food was still delicious
but it's the only thing i see holding mint back from sheer excellence
prolly one of the best indian_restaurants in las_vegas area
a variety of cuisines made in the most authentic manner
the service is just wonderful and food quality is just amazing
every time i go to vegas i go to this place without fail
there's a lot of haters but it seems their issues stem from the lunch buffet
of which we did not partake
i went for a night out with my boyfriend and we opted for the indian sampler
our server was also one of the
lucky owners
an extremely cordial and friendly man who recommended some delicious beers
it's obvious that he's a man who takes his libations seriously
which we appreciated
he explained that during the time of day we were there
he opted to maintain the restaurant himself
aside from showcasing an impressive work ethic
it allows him to interact with his customers and gain insight on their reactions and feelings
he takes an active interest in the reviews and responses of individuals and mentioned that he periodically updates this page himself
so
hi
thanks for the meal
we started with the don de dieu
a canadian beer with a high alcohol percentage while still being light
floral
fruity and crisp
it was a nice beverage to sample while awaiting our food and taking in the environment
the interior is a pleasant cool green shade with dark wood tones on the tables
floor and chairs that we found very soothing and appealing
there are several pieces of art on the walls as well as iron work
the bar is well_stocked and there is a window that lets you peak into the kitchen
gently wafting in the background was atmosphere music
not too obtrusive but a pleasant addition
the first food that was brought to us were flat breads that were studded with cumin coriander seeds
they were folded over themselves and super thin
with a light crunch and pleasant mouthfeel
they were served with a mint and tamarind_chutney
the tamarind was sweet and tangy but the mint was cool and savory
i vastly preferred the mint but we enjoyed both
we were given a refill of the bread and sauces prior to our meal
the sampler itself was brought out on a large metal tray
with each dish presented in a small metal container
initially it looked like it may not be that much food
but as we began to ate we realized that the small containers were easily enough to feed
maybe even light eaters
with a refill of rice
we were extremely satisfied
the meal included
fresh baked garlic_naan
hearty flat breads with fresh herbs and garlic studded throughout
served at the center of the platter and ideal for dunking into residual sauces soup
vegetable pakodas
crispy
deep_fried bites of mixed_vegetables
excellent dipped into the tangy and rich homemade whole milk yogurt and a dollop of ghost chili sauce
chicken_tikka_masala
creamy with hearty chunks of chicken in a sauce that gradually ramps up the heat in_your_mouth
after a few bites it gains an addictive spice
lamb_vindaloo
like a stew
with a spice and sweetness differentiating it from the usual western stew
i particularly enjoyed this and would look_forward to ordering it again
organic tandoori_chicken
tender
flavorful chicken with a yummy spice rub coating the outside
giving it a bright reddish pink tinge
there were two peices and they were a little small
so this would be the only downside to ordering the platter for more than people
they may be willing to adjust the serving for a larger party if you ask
as they seem quite amicable
mixed_vegetable curry of the day
our's had lots of zucchini
chickpeas
tomatoes and a rich sauce
i probably wouldn't order this by itself
but that's simply because i dug the other vegetable based dish so much more
chef's choice lentil soup
this was delicious
it had a strong turmeric flavor and color
and was very flavorful
the lentils weren't very chunky
so the soup itself was not exceedingly thick
i enjoyed the consistency
personally
fresh
homemade whole milk yogurt
one of my other favorite options
it was extremely creamy with a rich tang and was an instant relief from some of the strongly flavored dishes
a great way to cleanse your palate between dishes or dolloped on top of them
aromatic basmati_rice
a chewier
drier rice that easily soaked up much of the sauce from the dishes
a good compliment as the texture of the rice really helped to enrich and fortify the thinner or lighter dishes
khir dessert
sweet rice_pudding with what i thought may have been a hint of rosewater
i ate most of it and really enjoyed it
while eating we enjoyed two other beers
as well
yeti
an indian beer that had a hoppy
smokey flavor
it was more of a dry lager
but went very very well with the food
we really enjoyed it and asked our server about sourcing it
we ended with piraat
a potent amber beer with an earthy tang and a hoppy afterbite
also quite good
but strong
i gave most of mine to the boy to finish so i could safely navigate our journey home
i definitely intend to go back sometime for the lunch buffet and their other set menus
it's a great introduction to a new culture's cuisine in a nice
relaxed atmosphere with helpful and pleasant service
mint_bistro is an unassuming gem in the university section of las_vegas
right across_the_street from unlv on flamingo
mint_bistro is one of the best indian_restaurants_in_town
the university paradise section of town already has around great indian_restaurants
but mint_bistro is the best
the outside of the restaurant makes you think that it is a take out restaurant
but once you walk in you will feel welcomed by the comfortable indian decor
i have been to mint_bistro about times
and have always had great food
my_favorite_dish is the saag_paneer
which is house made cheese sauteed with spinach
they make a very good version of one of my favorite indian dishes
i also really like the mango masala with chicken
this dish combines the classic flavors of a chicken masala with the sweet mango flavor
the other dish i usually try to get is the rebel curry
very flavorful
but spicy
curry
served with your choice of meat
if you are a vegetarian
mint_bistro has many options for you
but if you eat meat you have many options
too
mint_bistro also has a great selection of belgian beers
my favorite that i had was the duchesse de bourgogne
but they have many more
although it sounds random for a indian restaurant to have a great selection of belgian beers
they have some of the best i have seen
definitely try the great pairing of the beer with the indian food
if_you_are_looking for indian and nepalese food with a twist
definitely try mint
before you read the review
you must understand a few things
this is the only
indian nepalese
place i've eaten at in vegas
the only other
indian
food i've had has been homemade by ethnic indians or at diwali events
i am not an expert in either of these two cuisine types
but i do like good food
we came here for a dinner with some friends
we had a friend in from china
and since she likes to eat
we decided on a place where we can try something new
while socializing
we also know that indian food meets many different dietary wants and needs
and this place has decent reviews and reasonable_prices
so we came to mint
we arrived at pm to a very clean and modern dining_room
the dining_area was a little over half full
the clientele seemed very diverse with a mix of cultures and varying levels of dress
mint easily accommodated our party of
which was nice
we had a nice big table and were not cramped
nor did we cramp the other tables around us
the staff seemed friendly enough
however
we were waiting for members of our party to arrive for about minutes
but our waiters never asked for drink or app orders
that wasn't a huge issue
but once we ordered apps and drinks our waiter didn't ask us for our dinner orders for about another minutes
we were all engaged in conversation
which i guess could have encouraged the waiter not to ask us
overall
we were there for hours
and the service was only so so
the food was good
the wife and i shared the vegetarian sampler platter
everything we had was distinctive
flavorful
and delicious
i don't know indian nepalese food too well
so i can't say how authentic it was or was not
but it was pleasing to my palate
we asked for a level spice
but i am pretty sure the waiter did not accommodate that as our food was not too spicy
we like heat
and only one of our dishes had a bit of heat
i was very impressed with things
the wide selection and friendliness towards vegans and vegetarians
we had more selections than we knew what to do with
i am really excited to go back to mint just to try some more
beer_selection
there is a great selection of indian and european beers here
they range in price from a bottle
but they have selections here i've not seen anywhere_else in vegas
additionally
they do have a
beer of the month
which they sell cheaper_than the others
this month the beer is a very good belgian white
the brand escapes me
overall
it was a good experience
other than the service
but i think i will be back
i had dinner here tonight and it was very good
i started with complimentary papadam with two dipping_sauces that were both quite good
the main_course was a fusion mango chicken made with fresh mango
i had an order of garlic_naan with the meal and a glass of delicious mango_lassi
i guess by now you can see the theme of my dinner tonight
after the main part was over
i had kheer
indian rice_pudding
for dessert
it was a small
whiskey shot glass sized dessert that was a perfect ending to the meal
i really enjoyed the place although when it's crowded
the seating might be a little close to your neighboring diners
for out of towners who know the area
mint is almost directly across flamingo road from the atomic testing museum
delicious vegan friendly food
chau_chau was out_of_this_world
we were the only patrons on our visit
so the service was first rate
appetizers were flavorful
including the momo's that we tried
i didn't realize the nepalise element here
turkey on the menu at indian places is odd
but the food was very good overall
beer_selection was impressive but i didn't have the right circumstances to participate in that
i recently tried the lunch buffet there
and it was alright
you could tell some dishes weren't freshly_made and the chicken was also bit dry
i also felt there weren't enough selection also
service was great though
just had the lunch buffet
the service was good the food was delicious
i'll_definitely_be_back
i usually find the food in las_vegas not very good
i am an outsider
my only experiences have been on the strip
so please don't think this is a blanket statement about the entire area
but
on and around the strip i have generally found the food sub par and relatively expensive
i don't doubt some of the food is excellent
but i don't want to pay morton's prices just to get high_quality foods
thank you yelp
without which i would not have discovered mint_indian_bistro
excellent service with good prices
we asked for our server's recommendations on a entree budget
for two people
we had more than enough food and were very happy with the quality and subtle flavors and spices
also
typically indian food leaves my digestive track in lurches afterwards
not so here
a great reasonable dinner just off the strip
that is
as_good_as_it_gets
in las_vegas
i have been coming here since i found it in its prior name
himalayan restaurant
the first time i came here
we used the coupon from restaurant
com
i had a hard time finding a good indo pak restaurant
so good thing there is restaurant
com
first time
appetizer
himalayan samosas potatoes and peas
stuffed in a light fluffy pastry
but
the best thing about this is dipping it into the tamarind_chutney
dang this is awesome
chicken rebel curry spicy
not much else
i haven't been ordering this
not memorable
let's move on
lamb_vindaloo spicy and tons of flavor
the lamb was nice and tender
garlic_naan were not short of garlic
top that lamb_vindaloo pieces with a shred of onion and dip it into the tamarind_chutney
wow
mango_lassi is good as ever
my friend said that coupon or no coupon
we are coming_back fo sho
second time
didn't use a coupon so we were able to get
indian sampler
garlic_naan
pakodas dumpling kinda look
with vegetable stuffed inside
the outside is a chickpea batter
this was dipped into a nutty sauce
interesting combination
chicken_tikka_marsala
lamb_vindaloo
tandoori_chicken chicken was very juicy with a nice spice rub
vegetable_curry for a vegetable_curry
this is so flavorful
yogurt
this was homemade
it was super tart
too tart for my taste
basmati_rice
i am used to the jasmine rice
but this basmati is on a new playing field
khir dessert is this rice_pudding
basmati_rice
yay
in milk
spiced
with nuts and raisins
this is one of my favorite dessert
once again
bursting with flavors
this sampler was perfect
we got to tried out everything
recommend for adventurous newbies
they weren't super spicy either so is easy on the tongue
and tummy
since there are so may other dish that one can alternate between the spicy one
lamb_vindaloo
third time and so on
ghosht karahi
goat_curry
flavors remind me of back home
aahhhh
i miss home
ok
focus
so
my routine comes to play
i ask for a side of onion and some lemon wedges
i mix the onion with the goat_curry
and squeeze lemon in it
it's amazing how the onion would make the flavor even spicier
and how the lemon juice brings out that tang
now try this with the best naan that i have tasted yet
the naan with fruits in the middle
this is the only place that have it
as far as i know
you get savory and sweet
have mango_lassi with this entree is the perfect combination
of course i have the khir at the end of my every meal
service has always been super for me
the owners are sooooooo fantastic
they are so kind and wonderful
i love the decor
oh
i forgot to mention
they have a very extensive beer_selection
my friends always order beer and try like three different kinds every time
i stick to my mango_lassi and am happy with it
this was absolutely_delicious
had the malai_kofta and was amazing
i can't say enough good things about this place
i'd had their food back when they were called himalayan restaurant and it was very good
my recent dinner visit was the first time i had actually been inside the restaurant and the first time i'd had the food since they came under new ownership
the waiter was very helpful and friendly
he suggested getting the vegan sampler when we informed him we wanted to try everything on the menu
so
we ordered the vegan sampler which was perfect for two people
every item was amazing except for the carrot
i think
which was a little too sweet for my taste
the sampler comes with two sides of basmati_rice
roti and six or seven other items
the soup and chana saag were my favorites
i'll_definitely_be_back to try the dosas
my boyfriend and his buddy went here the other night
they ordered multiple entrees
including a two for one tikka masala
we all greatly enjoy their yogurt
so they finished off their helpings and asked for extras
which the service complied with
when they were leaving
he asked for an extra yogurt so that he could bring some home for the leftovers
when the check was brought to the table
he was able to take a look at it before another one was quickly brought out
when he asked why he was being given a different check
he was told it was so that they could apply the two for one tikka masala
that was untrue the first check already showed the two for one discount
the only discernable difference was that he'd been charged a dollar for the yogurt
it's not a big_deal that they charged him a dollar for the yogurt the problem is that they obviously felt the need to lie about it after failing to mention anything earlier
that was really disappointing
we will probably be back for the food and interesting beer_selection
but being lied to is a big turn off
great food
decent service at not a bad price
i will go there again and again
in fact we ate ther everyday except one day while we stayed at vegas for days
will go back again
we went there for lunch buffet and the food was very disappointing
even their lassi bar was not good
will_never_go_back to this place again
lunch buffet is awesome
a good variety of indian favorites and they bring out fresh naan
on top of that students get a discount
for lunch and dinner
ok here is why i am giving mint
we walked in before the lunch buffet was about to close
the owner offered to keep things as long as we like and even cooked up more food that got low
he personally came over talked to use and went the extra mile
to make this a great experience
note for those with restaurant
com certificates
apparently they have a conflict with restaurant
com and aren't accepting their coupons
however
they honored the discount themselves and told us to get a refund for our certificate and will probably do the same for others
he looked upset a bit explaining it so it's probably something ugly
i thought it was cool that they will honor it themselves to help out the customers
for years i ate indian food on a weekly basis and for a while i stayed away since i burned out and the bf never had indian food before so away we went
the drink selection is one main reason that made me really want to try them
we are beer nerds so it makes for a lovely surprise that a unassuming bistro would have such an impressive drink menu
the bf wasn't sure of what
and our server
i think possibly the owner
asked what kinds of flavors he likes and gave a few recommendations
i always appreciate a place that knows what they sell since it seems most people don't care about beer the way they do of wine
the bf took his suggestion of a augustjn abbey ale
and i had a troubadour obscura
which the guy poured into tulips with care to produce a proper head
i had a nerd moment that they had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our drinks as much as we do
he treated it like a sommelier would a fine wine
while we waited for food we were served papadam with a tamarind_chutney and a cilrantro mint_chutney
all really finely made
for food we really couldn't decide to we went with a indian sampler
it doesn't_look_like a lot of food
but we were both comfortably full
it includes
chicken_tikka_masala this was a lovely tikka
i've had a lot and this was one of the better ones i've had
very robust
but balanced
the bf loved this and raves it's the best curry he's had and he had a foodie moment
aww
i think us yelpers are getting to him
maybe he'll change his mind about doing reviews one day
lamb_vindaloo the lamb was very tender and the sauce complimented it very well with a bit earthiness
tangyness and a tad spicy
tandoori_chicken crisp and nicely spiced outside
juicy inside
mixed veggie curry had a good mix of cauliflower
zucchini
beans
peppers
the curry had a very light and fragrant flavor to it
i can't quite place the spices
but i liked this
chef choice of lentils today it was daal
i like daal since it's earthy and comforting
we got yoghurt
basmati_rice
and garlic_naan as well
the naan was pretty noms here
khir came with it for dessert
it's a rice and milk porridge with raisins
nuts and cardamom according to the menu
when i was eating it
to me it tasted more flowery than just cardamom
like possible orange blossom water was added
it's the kind of light dessert that would be amazing for a hot summer day since it's served cold and has such bright flavors
we also ordered another dessert that i thought i had and loved at another restaurant and at friends house but haven't come across it in a while
turns_out it was what i was looking for
lal mohan
the description says it's served cold
but it's served piping_hot
it's these round pastries that are fried so the outside is crisp and the inside has a creamy kind of dough
they throw it into syrup and it absorbs it so it flavors it throughout
they come to a serving in a shot glass
balls are about gumball sized so you don't get much of it
but it's quality
it's a comforting kind of dessert that would be a good for people who like fried mochi with honey
warm donuts
zeppolis
beignets
the service was friendly_and_helpful
i like the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates
utensils were impeccably polished no water marks at all
it felt very comfortable with the warm decor and the good staff making you feel good about being there
i just got a strong feeling that they are proud of this place in the pride they take for the little details
i haven't been this surprisingly satisfied in a long time
the bf was super happy with discovering indian food and having a food epiphany of sorts about it
days later he's still telling me about the tikka and how he wants to go next weekend
definitely we will_be_coming_back for a la_carte and also the buffet sounds like a deal
if our next experience is as good as this one
it can quickly grow to be a favorite
stars
it was a very similar day to my previous review
copious laundry yet to be folded and lazy me coerced my husband to thinking that we need to partake in mint's buffet this last saturday
i remembered a message one of the owners of mint had sent me letting me know that they had taken my previous review into consideration and created a better buffet
it's a rare occasion that small business owners give you positive reactions on a negative review so i was impressed enough to give mint another chance
wow
the of us were truly surprised
in a really good way
and absolutely enjoyed this buffet
there was a thin tomato_soup that was tangy and a prolific salad chutney assortment
also their dal tadka was to die for
i filled multiple bowls of this delicacy
the pakoras
indian vegetable tempura
were excellent
special shout out to the thinly slivered potatoes coated with the garbanzo flour mixture
yumminess
soft and airy idlis with a thick and tasty sambar
the best in vegas thus far
spoke to the south_indian in me
there was lemon_rice that was full of flavor and their spicy chau_chau noodles that were oh so perfect and what i am currently salivating about
there were vegetable dishes
one paneer
and at least meat based dishes on the buffet
garlic naans plain naans rotis were brought to the table with the blink of an eye
now for the grand finale
dessert
my eyes popped when i saw they served gulab_jamun
balls of dough and milk
deep_fried and served in sugar syrup
the gulab jamuns were warm
melt in the mouth and probably the best i've had out here
dessert nirvana
mint pulled out all the stops at their new buffet and i for one
will be a repeat customer as long as i get my belly filled like this
for
this was a stellar deal and of course
the service was just as impeccable as before with the nice waiters
i've always wanted to check_this_place_out but never knew where it was until i passed it while we were on our way to mob month at the library
i definitely wanted to try it so i kept a mental note for after the lecture
we started_off_with drinks i had the rose lassi
the rose flavor was really delicate
it didn't taste like i was consuming a rose garden
my husband had the pomegranate martini
he thought it was a little strong and so did i but i don't think that taste can be avoided when you are mixing juice with vodka
i've had a martini made with baileys before
i think that's more my speed
i don't think it was a true martini but the taste is much smoother
i ordered the half order of lamb_biryani
it was good but while i was eating it i came across some very strong spices
you know the feeling when you accidentally bite into a peppercorn
it felt_like that but i'm not sure what type of spice it was
it looked like a miniature piece of a tree branch but the tender lamb made up for it
my husband ordered the chicken_tikka salad
the seasonal veggies that came with salad were super fresh
good size cucumbers tomatoes
and chicken
beautiful colors
it tasted good too
it's perfect for a late_night snack that will not weigh you down
it tasted even better when you put some of the salad on the naan and roll it up
my husband agreed that i know what i'm talking_about it because he liked it
that's no easy feat
we wanted to try some dessert so i ordered the mango kulfi
it's basically a milky mango_ice_cream
it's not sour like a sorbet
it was pretty tasty
my husband went out of his vanilla box of his basic dessert choices
he also had no choice because there is no ice_cream sundaes here
he ordered the lal mohan which looked kind of like like juicy brown eggs
i thought the he might be scared off by it but he tried it and like it
i tried some too
if you are the type that doesn't like too much syrup on your french toast then this may not be for you
i'm one of those people
these are milk based pastries drowning in syrup
it was cool trying something new though
the service was awesome
our waiter helped us decide on the desserts
he genuinely cared what we thought of the food
which was refreshing
the waiter had a nice warm personality where when he said
hope you come back soon
you have to believe him
if you like indian food
go here
you will not be sorry
delicious food and great staff
i can't_wait_to_go_back and try the buffet
indian buffet has always been a noun combination i could get behind
or into my belly
and then i did
for ten bucks i consumed heartily a fine assortment of deliciousness
i wish i had more to say
but really
i enjoyed everything i popped on and in
i was so craving_indian_food
it's been months since i've had any and due to my last experience at namaste several months_ago i needed an indian fix
thanks to the reviews of fellow yelpers i took my talemts to mint
so after reading their menu on line for a few days i new my wife and i would be getting the indian sampler
served with rice
homemade yoghurt
and khir for dessert
garlic_naan fresh warm and pretty much melted in_your_mouth
i like to use it to scoom the rice and other dishes
vegetable pakodas fried veggie chips with plenty of flavor
lentil the chef's way lentil soup
very tasty had a hint of cilantro that was outstanding
the lamb and chicken dishes were so warm
flavorfull and comforting
i only chose level spice not knowing how hot it would be
next time i will leap to a
not being brave but curious
and i do not eat spicy food at all
so much to say about these dishes but please go and experience them for yourself
you will not be dissapointed
not a fan of rice puuding
the khir which is similar was fery smooth
rich
tasty ans flavorful
can't_wait_to_go_back
thanks to my friends for coming along
who have dinned here before and enjoyed it once again
awesome food here
an impressive menu with tons of veg dishes
gulab_jamun was a little sweet
but delish savory plates way made up for it
i've been to mint_indian_bistro for dinner once before
but i wasn't blown_away by the food
luckily
i tried the lunch buffet this time around
and was pleasantly_surprised at the quality of the food
one thing that i did like on my first visit and still like about this place is the decor
it's definitely a good place to go for a romantic date
i also am fond of the service here
anyways
back to the food
at the table
the server brought us our choice of either plain
butter or garlic_naan
we chose garlic
and also roti
a thinner bread made with whole_wheat
the garlic_naan was yummy soft
warm and studded with garlic bits
it was perfect for dipping into the soups and curries
the roti was good too
but i definitely prefer the naan
i can't remember all i ate
but i will list off my favorites
there were three soup varieties
i enjoyed the sambhar soup
a hearty lentil soup
the most
i also enjoyed the seasoned rice dish
as well as the chicken tandoori and a vegetarian dish called paneer_tikka_masala
blocks of soft cheese simmered in a spicy tomato based stew
i also thought the chicken curry dish to be flavorful and good
for dessert
i had a few cubes of watermelon and one piece of gulab_jamun
fried balls of dough soaked in a sweet syrup flavored with cardamom and rosewater
i wish i went back for seconds on dessert though
the best part about the lunch buffet is that it is healthy or at least tastes healthy
all in all
i had a nice time here
i would probably go back again for lunch
that is
p
s
parking here during busy times can be dangerous
small parking_lot
too many cars
etc
be careful
service is very friendly
million times better than the indian restaurant we go to in la valley
the green cilantro dipping sauce for the pappadams is super fresh
soups are so good served steaming hot tried both the dal the bean lentil
love the ayce lunch buffet
items change daily
so i need to keep going back to catch the chana_masala
just wish tney offered dosas as part of buffet but they do have an ayce dosa nite
but there are always vegan_options available on buffet those soups
salad fresh papadams
definitely a return to place
my favorite indian_cuisine in the valley
the food is fresh
delicious
and perfectly seasoned
i highly_recommend this restaurant to anyone
regardless if you've ever eaten this kind of food before
i've eaten from both the lunch buffet and the a la_carte menu
and have been delighted every time
with every dish
my favorites include their tandoori_chicken
turkey mo mo
potato and pea samosas
and their delectable garlic_naan
their beer_selection is excellent
and the atmosphere is lovely
a
there are many decent indian_restaurants_in_town
but here is one more yelp vote calling this place the best indian lunch buffet in vegas
big selection
so even if one item is not to your liking
ingredient or spice wise
there will be plenty else to nosh on
service is quick to get beverages and naan on the table
and tables cleared for new customers
you feel very welcome here
side note
always a bummer though to see how much food is wasted at buffets here in town
c'mon folks take a lil to see if ya like it
and if you do
go back for more
discarding plates still piled with food is appalling
and please at least have had a meal in the last hours the single diner next to us sat_down and demanded three baskets of naan right off the bat
did he finish them
no
i'm usually here for lunch
and they do a very nice buffet every time i've been here
there's a nice mix of vegetarian and meat dishes
and i've_never_seen the exact same menu two days in a row for lunch
dinner here is good too
they do a nice tandoori_chicken
which is how every indian restaurant should be judged in my opinion
at least if they offer it
overall
very happy with this place
and they also have a limited bar menu
plus wine and beer
i went to mint a couple of weeks_ago with a bunch of fellow computer scientists for a birthday lunch
the place is pretty small and the buffet area seems small
but the selection is decent
if you know me at all
you'll know that the first thing i look for is butter_chicken
a quick scan of the lineup reveals a disappointing no
so right off the bat
this puts them at a disadvantage against namaste
then i found the goat_curry
at an indian buffet
i really only need one go to item and luckily
the goat_curry was off the hook
it's not quite the naan heaven that is butter_chicken
but paired with rice
i enjoyed every morsel
as for the naan
i like how they bring it out to order
this can lead to moments of naan less agony
but at least you know it's always warm and fresh when it comes to your table
the garlic_naan has an overpowering aroma and is the only way to fly
i haven't tried any of their lassis
but that will definitely change today at the cmye
i love me some mango_lassi
but the other flavors are intriguing
overall
i'm definitely a fan of this place
quite honestly
i'd pick namaste over mint for one simple reason
which should be easy to deduce by now
still
mint is a solid lunch buffet choice
edit
i've since been back and i'm not sure why i thought the buffet area is small
there are quite a few dishes from which to choose
i guess it's because i only found a couple of items that interested me
i've been here many times for dinner
but not buffet
this review is for the lunch buffet
there were many items in the buffet line
ranging_from vegetarian to meat courses
the quality and taste of the dishes exceed my expectations even more now
i love goat karahi
i have been to many indian_restaurants where the goat karahi isn't consistent
i know i can count on mint to make sure that each piece is tender and flavorful
i mixed my tender chunks of goat meat with slices of onions and cucumbers
then squeezed lemon on them and tossed it around some more
it was delicious
and the naan was great as well
however
goat karahi wasn't the only star on today's menu
according to me
of course
i have tried tandoori_chicken at many places
but i find it lacks flavor
when debbie said that the tandoori_chicken is her favorite
i decided to grab a piece to give it a try
boy was i glad debbie raved_about it
it was sooooo gooood
i tore off a piece of this delicious chicken that bursted with flavor and put it on top of freshly baked garlic_naan
i then dipped it into the tamarind_chutney and wala
yummy in my tummy
i was full at this point
but still had to eat my favorite dessert
khir
i was super excited_to_see this in the buffet line
i love the basmati_rice
slow cooked in milk with a dash of cardamom
i got two servings
one for roland
and one for myself
somehow
they both ended_up being consumed by me
oops
khir
i can't help myself
i also had the lal mohan
again
tried this at other places
never liked it
luckily
debbie also raved_about this so i gave it a shot
thank goodness i tried it because it is delicious
and the staff
attentive and friendly
as always
the food is delicious and they have a good selection
i've never had bad service any time of day that i've gone
and their bar is pretty diverse
this is definitely a
staple
indian restaurant for me
even i am not familiar_with_indian_food
only curry and naan
this is really good experience to me
i was little late for the event so i didn't get enough information about every food in there but still i taste most of them
the food wasn't greasy at all
i really like that part
i like goat_curry and yellow curry
with veggie
i'll find out this one's name next time
i hope their new menu working well
their drink have different texture but was good
i will be there again
i really want to give this restaurant all five_stars
just because the service was fantastic
however
i can't say that i loved the food entirely
this won't stop me from coming_back though since i did only try the items on their lunchtime buffet menu
i will definitely have to go back for dinner
i will just point out the positive aspect of my experience for now
fantastic service
right when i walked through the doors
i was greeted_by the staff and felt very welcome
our waiter made sure to check up on us several times during our meal and was very hospitable
nice accommodation
very cute and quaint mom_and_pop restaurant
the interior decor is nice and their choice of music is very soothing
the restaurant is very clean as well
which is a huge plus
food
i'm not a huge_fan_of rice_pudding but they actually won me over with their rice_pudding
their garlic_naan is also delicious very light and fluffy
actually
i really loved most of their vegetarian_vegan dishes
this place was a frickin gem found right closely off the vegas strip
authentic
delicious tibetan nepalese food very testy mango_lassie
try the nepalese dinner
for two
its was perfect
even for people
i yelped and i googled and i yelped when i was in the process of purchasing a voucher from restaurant
com
the foods was great but not for the money
this is my first time i tried rest voucher
i took a friend with me
it was definitely a lot less valuable as groupon
from what i've gathered
there was groupon offered at this restaurant recently
groupon imposed no conditions on money spent
i assume you ordered foods or more with your purchase
then you paid the tax and tips on top
for a minimal of
rest voucher dictated you ordered twice as much and paid tip
plus tax
for voucher
you may pay for it
you have to order min of food
so the final total was about
what's my saving
if i've got the voucher for free
i still paid about
how much is my saving then
if i order the foods without the voucher
i would have paid about too
what's wrong with this picture
with this irritation aside
the foods were good
not excellent
but tasty
i was surprised with a one page nepalese section
i have never tried nepalese foods before
and i don't consume east indian foods often
so we ordered nepalese sampler
and a tandouri chicken
there was also a indian sampler for
available
the portion on the sampler was so small
oz per metal cup
that i could easily finish by myself and still feel hungry
it came with pieces of turkey dumpling
oz red curry chicken
cubes
oz vegetarian
small pieces of skewed lamb
in oz cup
oz broth
oz cucumber salad
servings of oz steamed rice
small pieces of brown desserts
and one cut up naan
luckily we had tandouri chicken to contribute a small space in our stomach
it came with small pieces of thighs and drumstick with plenty of onions
i have to be honest
i don't have a fine palate for indian_cuisine
the nepalese foods tasted like indian foods
even though it tasted good
but i had similar or better at various cities
a meat sampler costs
and tandouri chicken
during a visit to flagstaff
i thought it was a bit pricey at the time comparing to the restaurant in socal excluding san diego
the service was plain ordinary
i can hardly understand our server's thick accent
i wound never have paid tips on this kind of service
the location was off the strip but in the midst of asian commercial district
there were many indian and some filipino restaurants in the neighborhood
so diners
beware what you are getting from restaurant
com voucher
it feels like a scam to benefit the restaurants
groupon is a better deal here
i feel the price is at least more than other places
regardless vegas charm or not
i won't be back for there is no knowledge gain but a bad overall experience and the worse value i have ever had for a long time
absolutely tasty
this place is one of the best indian_restaurants i've been to
there mixture of indian
tibetan and nepal is a refreshing blend
the first time i went there i asked for paneer_pakora which wasn't on the menu and the owner went to the kitchen and made me up a plate which tasted amazing
they have lots of beers from india and alot of lassi drinks
just to prove my taste_buds are on the level i recently brought a friend who's wife is from india and she said very tasty and top_notch
well worth it
nice_atmosphere as well
everything was really great
nice_atmosphere and delicious food
cant wait_to_go_back
if you like indian food or would like to give indian food a try you can't_go_wrong with mint india
had their combination plate for dinner some months_ago and went there today with a group of friends for the lunch buffet
fantastic food at a low price
if you're a beer lover have the taj_mahal with your food and the tikla
sp
gold for dessert
the garlic_naan is exceptional
stopped in for the lunch buffet and the selection was wonderful had all the basic indian dishes
there were a lot of vegetarian_dishes i winced at
for person
it's a great deal
me and my friends went to the lunch buffet for the first time
so this review is for the lunch buffet only
the selection is very limited with a total of about items
that's including the desserts and soups but not including the chutney_bar
which has about chutneys
which i don't care much about
the food is ok for the price
but not the service
me and my friends just felt_like we weren't welcome there
the servers never greeted us when he saw us walking in
also very slow when it comes to taking away the plates
we only had plates each
not like it was busy in any way
the restaurant was half empty despite it's small space
during the
granted brief
time we were there he never came to our table to check if we need more naan or not
after we got our second plate
the server gave_us the check without asking
and without saying a word to us
we gave him the money and were supposed to get bucks something as change but he just assumed that's the tip for him
which to his credit he was right
but i still expected him to bring the change back first
but he never did
of course when we left there's no acknowledgement or goodbye in any form
their bad manner and service
might
have something to do with my friends being chinese
a form of prejudice
they didn't think we'll tip
we weren't wearing suits but t shirts and jeans
i don't know for sure
we won't be back
that's for sure
i have experienced a few misses while trying to find a good indian restaurant
this place is the total package
the decor is filled with soothing earth tones
the employees are friendly_and_attentive
the food is pleasing to the palate
the best part
the lunch buffet is only
at this price
i can afford to buy lunch for myself and a few friends
unlike my last experience at a different restaurant
mint is great at keeping the hot foods hot and the cold foods cold
the salad and fruit selections were limited
but they were crisp and refreshing
i am a sucker for indian sauces
my favorite being mango and mint_chutney
i can eat it with everything
the vast selection of gluten_free
vegetarian
and vegan friendly foods makes it a no brain option for when i'm with friends who steer away from meat
the kadhai paneer was one_of_my_favorites
a firm cheese with a mild taste in a curry_sauce
yet meat lovers will not go hungry
the tandoori_chicken was cooked_to_perfection
nice juicy pieces that were seasoned exceptionally well
chicken chilli was probably the best meat dish offered though
the spice is not over powering but strong
try the rice_pudding
the only criticisms i have are that certain dishes were either too sweet or too salty
the masala rice needed to be mixed with some basmati
the galub jamun gave me an instant toothache and numbness of the tongue from the sugar overload
other than that
i would happily come here again
we were ravenous and this was the first vegas eatery we dined at
i believe the lunch buffet is open until
i chose this restaurant due to the veg friendly sites touting vegan naan
the buffet had plenty of vegan and vegetarian items to choose from and my omni boyfriend had a few meat options to satisfy his flesh eating desires
while i enjoyed my vegan naan he thought it was just 'ok' and ordered an additional basket of the original version
they had three different soups and i think all of them at least vegetarian
the surprise of our meal was how delicious their wittekerke belgian wheat beer
was
it was yummy and we ordered a second round
they also have awesome mango_chutney
our server appeared aloof or stoned
but it didn't really bother us
great lunch for a decent price
truly the best indian food at very reasonable_prices
kwati soup
tandoori_chicken and saag_paneer half orders were plenty for two people to share
wayne gorsek
we went to mint with great expectations after reading all the rave reviews
my experience was average at best
ves
the staff was friendly
very clean place
the food looked freshly prepared and was not oily at all
they had a variety of chutneys
dips and fresh salad and fruit
the kheer
indian rice_pudding
was yummy
the naan was crisp
i would have preferred a dash of butter as that's how i like the garlic_naan but the taste was not bad
the sambhar
idli and chutneys tasted very good
not so ve
the vegetarian choices were just ok
the pakoras were cold and therefore not crisp
the potato and bellpepper
and the shahi_paneer were ok but lacked flavor
the spinach tasted more like garlic than spinach
we asked for tandoori rotis and got tandoori roti between the of us and had to ask for another tandoori roti and naan
i was told that the chicken and meat dishes were just ok
am not sure if my experience was colored by my expectation but i was expecting more
the price was great though
charming cheap
a wonderful small getaway
not the typical endless vegas buffet
just enough choices to get your buffet fix
small enough to not have to stand in line for minutes just to get your food
nice and simple appropriate decor
a busy place for lunch
but relaxing as well
top buffets in vegas
after days in the grand canyon this was the perfect meal
the indian sampler had a little tapas size portion of all the 'greatest hits' of indian_cuisine and was perfect for people
my husband enjoyed the gluten_free beer_selection
we asked for it not too spicy but it was still pretty spicy
but i like spicy
so that was ok
the staff are very nice and place is really clean
especially their bathroom
i love things in vegas that make you forget where you are
this is one of those places
my husband and i have been to several indian_restaurants in vegas
and this one is our favorite
we drive all the way to mint from summerlin b c the closer indian places just don't make food as good as mint does
restaurant is clean
simple decor
staff is nice
and you_can't_beat the
lunch buffet they offer
buffet isn't huge
but does offer enough delicious choices to be satisfied
also comes with naan
i'm especially a fan of the chicken_tikka_masala
it's my favorite indian dish and they know how to make it right here
definitely check them out when you're in the mood for a good indian meal
before i was going to write this review
i wanted to check out namaste so i can compare both lunch_buffets
let's just say mint_indian_bistro won hands_down
i've had both the lunch buffet and ala_carte dinner
both were great but the bargain is definitely the all_you_can_eat lunch buffet for
they had a good variety of both vegetarian and meat dishes
including chicken_korma
they make some of the best around
great flavor
creamy sauce
my fellow diners also loved the lunch buffet
one even exclaimed
if all vegetarian food tasted this good
he'd be a vegetarian
buffet includes tandoori_chicken and a lamb dish and they bring warm naan_bread to your table
they also have an extensive drink menu large selection of indian and belgian beers as well as specialty cocktails
this is a definite
will return
spot
we had the vegetarian sampler
plentiful quantity for two people and every dish was very tasty
i am never the first to suggest a buffet
but mint's lunch buffet has won me over
hands_down
i love the wide assortment of dishes
my fiance can enjoy the meat dishes
while i've no lack in the selection of vegetarian_options
and let's not forget the delicious naan
light with the perfect balance of softness and crispness
all for a cool
on weekdays
oh
and unlv students get a discount
my favorite dishes are the aloo saag
chana saag
and chau_chau
all are packed with such great spices and full of flavor
i can't leave without having a little bowl of the khir
rice_pudding
and also enjoy their gajar haluwa
the carrot pudding
i have dined here for dinner
but find i have such a tough time choosing one dish because i've become so used to sampling them all at the lunch buffet
the staff is excellent
you can catch the owner
very friendly
from time to time
the restaurant is always very clean
a friend introduced me to mint two years_ago and i've been hooked ever since
auuuggghhh
i don't want to give out five_stars anymore
my reviews are too positive
i have too many five_star reviews
so i changed the way i rate places
i'm more critical now and an establishment has to go way above and beyond expectations or be the best i've had in its category
unfortunately
mint_indian_bistro is the best_indian_food_i_have_ever had
period
i know
my life sucks
all i want to do is give a critical review
but i keep having outstanding experiences
when i opened the menu and saw dosas in the appetizers
i knew i was about the experience something special
dosas
my use of redundant punctuation should indicate the percentage exceeding one hundred that represents how much i love a good dosa
mint has giant flaky dosas filled with many different_types_of awesomeness
both southern and northern indian recipes are included on the menu
as well as tibetan and nepalese entree selections
i know of nothing like this back home in seattle
if someone else does
please tell me
this place was great from beginning to end
i don't do dessert at indian_restaurants so i can't_speak to that
but i did have a delicious blackberry lassi which i can say served a dual purpose as dessert beginning of the evening cocktail
they have a lunch buffet
but i didn't get to do that since my friend is a bit of a germophobe about buffets
so
in conclusion
best
awesome
great
and delicious
i'll have to wait another day at different restaurant to be comfortably critical
i can always go back to chutney's back home
i guess
really average food in buffet for lunch
it was a good selection but food was a little less than i would expect
my cousin and i are fans of indian food and when i saw the reviews decided we had to check it out
it was excellent
first a note on the atmosphere
the restaurant had been booked for some event that sounded like a presentation on maintaining your visa
the event ran over and they were not taking walk ins so it's difficult to give a proper evaluation of the noise and the typical crowd
however we had a reservation and the staff quickly adjusted
the fact that an all indian event would choose this place says something about the authenticity
we ordered samosa and garlic_naan to start
the pastry was light and crispy and the filling was perfect
the naan was light and fluffy
for main_courses we got a chicken_vindaloo which was tasty and well spiced and a shrimp mikhani
i had never heard of this dish and from the description was expecting something like a tikka massala
it wasn't
it had sweeter creamier taste
it was delicious and i highly_recommend it
the staff also brought us extra naan with dinner
this place is a gem and if you like indian food worth a trip off the strip
i can't stop going back
for students
all_you_can_eat
why not
i love the chicken pakora with mint_chutney and the rice_pudding
stars
slightly better than average indian food
and when you tell them spicy
believe me
they make it spicy
the staff is super friendly and the prices are a nice break from the typical overpriced vegas food
and this was probably the best meal i had during my stay in vegas
and the cheapest
and no ditzy waitresses waiters
woot
spicy and good quality
my friend and i love indian food
i wanted to bring some over her house to cheer her up
usually
i would have hit namaste
which is not far from my work
but they don't open until
so
i thought i would try mint
i got the
indian dinner
honestly
i can't say that i knew all of the things that i was eating
but yum
stars
came on saturday for the lunch buffet and was happy to walk in and see quite a few tables of indian patrons
that lets me know that the flavors are authentic and it was
even my cousin who spent some time in india was impressed with the quality
flavors
and selection
the buffet consists of a mixture of north and south_indian dishes
and every dish tastes so distinct with it's robust spices and flavors
the vegetarian_dishes are so flavorful they have the power to convert any carnivore
after devouring full plates
another cousin even made the comment
i am willing to become obese for this
that
in itself
is a testament to the deliciousness of mint_bistro
we actually had to practice some restraint from consuming the entire buffet ourselves
we_will_definitely_be_back
we cannot go anywhere in our travels without trying an indian buffet
i have not had a chance to review the mint_indian_bistro since our last visit to vegas
so better late than never
surprisingly
the experience is
minty
fresh on my mind so i still remember the taste
smells and excellent hospitality
the variety of food was excellent and more that enough choices were presented for meat and vegetables and the pakoras were fresh and not overly greasy
i was both surprised and delighted by the inclusion of eggplant in the vegetable_pakora medley
chicken_tika_masala was superb
and the goat_curry was just like mamma used to make
i even liked the gulab_jamun which is not my favorite dessert
but somehow the mint made it very tasty
i always feel a little weird eating with my hands but i saw so many others here doing the same
so i dug in and was up to my elbows in delicious indian_cuisine
maybe some things should stay in vegas
but not food reviews
especially the mint
it needs to be shared and appreciated by one and all
my husband and i ate here on our way home from vegas
i looked for an indian restaurant on yelp with good reviews and yelp saved the day again by leading us to this wonderful gem
they have meat
vegetarian and vegan_options
the buffet was huge and delicious
everything is clearly labeled whether it's vegan or vegetarian
too
which was so helpful
i could only wish to find this wonderful of a vegan friendly indian restaurant in l
a
i am on the hunt
i will be eating here everytime i visit vegas
dosas
ever since my beloved bollywood seemed to take a turn for the worse a couple years_ago
my husband and i decided to change it up and give mint a try
um
i may have been back here
or
times since then
they always start you off with free
and yummy
papadum with mint and tamarind sauces
their mango_lassis are soooo good and the lychee lassi that my husband randomly tried one day was pretty tasty as well
i'm boring and always order the same thing
saag_paneer
theirs never disappoints
however
and you get lots of paneer which makes me extra happy
we've also had the korma and saffron cauliflower and they are both great as well
i have dreams of the garlic_naan
i would say that the samosas are not so great
and if i was rating this by the buffet only
and the vegetarian food only
i would probably give it stars
maybe non_veg have a better experience at the buffet
but i'm not sure
we wanted to try a new indian place one sunday_afternoon
but got fed up because they are all closed between the hours of
so we finally decided to go to our old staple
mint
for the buffet
we had to laugh because the place was jam packed with indian customers
we said that all the other restaurants must close to come eat at mint for a late lunch
most days the food is amazing and occasionally it's just good
some days the
medium
spiciness is too mild and sometimes its too hot
but we've never had a bad experience here and the staff are wonderful and very friendly
definitely give it a try
and seriously
order a mango_lassi
note
their menu specifically states what items are vegetarian
vegan
and gluten_free
they even have vegan lassis
and they also have a great beer_selection
very good
the lamb was moist and just fell apart in my mouth
will visit again
visiting mint_indian_bistro two weeks in a row definitely warrants a review
our first visit was at dinnertime and we were utilizing our entertainment book coupon
for the husband and i
we ordered
karma korma
a creamy sauce sprinkled with nuts and assorted himalayan spices
with fresh veggies
rebel curry
this is the nepalese gurkha version of the famous curry with a rebelliously inspired exotic blend of curry spices
with lamb
garlic_naan
one thing i absolutely love are papadums and was so pleasantly_surprised when they offered these to us complimentary
other indian_restaurants don't offer it complimentary anymore
both entrees were so flavorful and just delicious that we couldn't resist checking out their ever so popular lunch buffet option
the daily lunch buffet is
with kids and under being free
ages to years are
it's offered from
am to
pm
one thing i appreciated was that they noted what food items were vegetarian and vegan
as someone who recently stopped eating dairy
i found this very useful
when ordering naan
i was able to get this sans butter
which was quite appreciative in my situation
and with my new dietary restrictions
i was still able to enjoy quite a lot of food items and left feeling full and satisfied
their buffet menu can be found on their_website
but it does change
overall
we were both quite content with their food
a la_carte or buffet
definitely one of the better indian_buffets in town
especially if_you're_looking for a vegetarian
vegan
or gluten_free menu
good food
no parking problem
one of the best indian_restaurants in vegas
i had such high hopes for this place
my boyfriend and i stopped here after hearing that they had a lot of vegan_options on their menu
first of all
it was freezing inside
so cold that i had to ask for a cup of tea because i was getting tired of sitting with goosebumps
we were both hungry
and got the vegan sampler
i got a cup of tea and we got a side of garlic_naan
the garlic_naan wasn't naan
it was just flatbread
roti
with way too much garlic pushed into the top
neither my boyfriend nor i could stomach that much garlic
and that's saying a lot coming from two garlic fiends
the vegan sampler was so small
for
we were expecting something to feed two people
it was more like for one person
you get a small
cup serving of vegan dishes
including cups of cooked white rice
it was not enough by_any_means
it was supposed to come with a side of coconut sorbet
but it never came
we were told they had replaced it with the
carrot pudding
that was on our sampler
we didn't want that
we wanted the coconut sorbet
so disappointed
way too expensive for the amount of food you get
my bill of
shouldn't have left us leaving still hungry
my tea cost
for one tea bag
never going back
a group of friends and i have a food club
where we get together every two weeks and take turns picking new restaurants to try
being a huge indian food fan
i was ecstatic to hear that someone had finally picked an indian restaurant
the service we received was great
my friend had informed the owner what it was we were doing
and he was more than accommodating
he sat_down with us and we were able to talk to him about the restaurant which is really nice
the food
however
was so disappointing
two of us split the indian sampler
as it was advertised that it was
perfect for two to share or one to feast on
naturally
i was expecting a bunch of food
to my disappoint
when the platter came out it was nothing more than barely a half cup of each item
it was not enough to satisfy one persons' hunger
let alone enough for two to share
we had even ordered an extra side of naan
it was sad to say
we had more naan than food to eat it with
it's a sad
sad day when that happens
i will say
their mango_lassi was good
a majority of my group was disappointed
just as i was
in the food to price proportions
although
many of them left full
unlike myself the price they paid for the food wasn't sitting too well with them
but who can blame em
my friend and i spent about dollars between the two of us
to leave the place completely dissatisfied and hungry
needless_to_say
when we left the restaurant
the first place i headed to was the jack in the box in the same parking_lot
and then i went to mint_indian_bistro in las_vegas
i tend to be quite the elitist when it comes to indian food
because i come from a family in the indian restaurant business
my aunt and grandmother have a joint in the valley
la
which i will not review because that would be biased
i'm cool like that
in any case
this place is the jam when it comes to indian food
seriously
i walked in with my parents
since we were in the mood for a spicy
delicious feast
i hopped on yelp and saw reviews from my friends matthew c
misti y
adina c
jade w
and the list goes on
these are friends in real life
so i know their star reviews are legit
the restaurant is nice
very nice
clean
dimly lit
large booths
very comfortable chairs
and the aroma of indian food is in the air
it's like a wet dream that you never wake up from
until you are done with your meal
pay the bill and walk out the door
the menu is quite diverse for an indian_joint
they have south_indian fare like dosas
bhel_puri and the like
you also have choices of nepali inspired dishes
tend to be on the spicier side
when you place your order
the server punches everything into an iphone
kudos for being high tech
we ordered the daal tarka
yellow lentils full order
the nepali chili_chicken
spicy
and the malai_kofta
half order
some roti
and rice
love the papad
and chutneys that magically show up before your food
now earlier
i went on and on about how this was a wet dream of a restaurant
the food was the one tugging at you
definitely the star of the show
the chicken blew my mind
so great
and was like a sensual symphony in my face
although i asked for it spicy
he probably thought i couldnt handle it
it came out medium
which might be spicy to those of you lacking melanin
who cares
it was fucking unreal
so delicious
the daal was perfect
not too much in spice
so you really got the flavor of the lentils
the full portion is quite large
go with a half
malai_kofta
this was fantastic too
typically restaurants will use a heavy cream in the recipe
and this dish can be unnecessarily unhealthy and heavy
the subtle hint of coconut milk helped make this a fantastic item on the menu
yes
ladies and gentlemen of yelp
this place is a star indian restaurant
i am coming_back
many
many times
aside from the restaurant in my family
and india_palace in memphis
tn
this is the best indian restaurant
i've ever dined at
and
i am indian
don't waste your time at gandhi
origin india
mt
everest or others
mint
mint
mint
my friends and i decided not to go to a buffet
because one of us was a vegetarian
we ordered the indian sampler and another dish for of us
everything was so delicious and filling
yumm
i went here with some friends during our recent vegas stay
it was really awesome
going to vegas
people always rave about the food
but i've never really found anything food wise that i cant live without
i am a vegetarian for almost years now and most buffets are meat seafood heavy and i just don't see the value in paying for salad
that makes indian food a really attractive option for me
i was with other people and we settled on indian after a little bit of back and forth negotiations
i am really glad_we_did
first
its a little off the strip so parking was easy_to_find
coming with people isn't always easy to accommodate without reservations but mint was more than accommodating
we had excellent service
we had a free appetizer and our glasses were always filled before we had to ask
the menu was fairly extensive
there were a lot of options
including many of the traditional_indian favorites
naan
kormas
masalas
etc
the portions were generous
served quickly and hot
my veggie_korma was really good
all around everyone was very happy with the dishes they ordered
some of the items we ordered included
veggie_korma
lamb_korma
naan garlic and plain
rice
dinner special menu set
mango_lassis
and chicken masala
the korma was smooth and not gritty
gritty korma is a pet peeve of mine
the dinner set came in traditional metal serving trays with many little sides
they didn't make a fuss in my request to substitute of the meat options for vegetarian_options
the vegetables were cooked correctly and not mushy overcooked
the spice_level was low for me but i also have a very high spice tolerance
everyone_else seemed to think it was around medium spicy
we split the check in
which they didn't give us any heartache about
i'd recommend it as a nice
calm place to get a solid
tasty
dinner while in vegas especially if you have a larger group and don't want to fight with the long lines at buffets
also mint is really vegetarian friendly
all in all
a great experience
very good food
excellent service
i'm planning on coming_back for the lunch buffet
if you ask
you can get gluten_free roti
bread
made from buckwheat
also our waiter asked how spicy i wanted my dishes
which i thought was great
i got and it was pretty darn hot and i like it spicy
an interesting mix if indian and nepalese food
it's a small place in a strip_mall but worth trying
the service is friendly and we met one of the owners
or managers
who was from the bay_area and chatted about indian_restaurants back home
tikka masala and butter_chicken are tasty but not at the level of my favorite in sf
mehfil
best i've had in vegas so far
i don't typically write review updates this quick
nor do i usually write another star_review for a place i absolutely love
there's no point in beating a dead horse
but i popped in for the lunch buffet at mint_indian_bistro with my dad yesterday and it blew my mind
indian_lunch_buffets are usually pretty sketch
in most cases
it's the food leftover from the night before
and it's obvious
not the case here
every_single item in the line was fresh
delicious
and tasted as if had been made right there and then
i know this because i had been here for dinner just a couple weeks back
so i could judge accordingly
i sampled a little bit of everything
the chili_chicken
the tikka masala
chicken pakorda
saag
daal tarka
the idli sambar
mmmmmm
for bucks
this really is the best lunch in all of las_vegas
you get a ton of food and it's delicious
if you have vegan or vegetarian friends
there are plenty of options in the buffet line as well
everything is clearly marked
so there is no hanky panky
service was great
just like last time
i can't_wait_to_come_back
in closing
no need to worry_about the lunch buffet here
it's just as good as the a la cart menu
feel free to eat your meals with your hands
and use the bathrooms afterwards to wash up
the bathrooms are spotless here
overall
great indian food at a reasonable_price
my boyfriend and i had a hankering for indian food the last time we were in vegas and with all the good reviews_on_yelp we decided to try the indian mint_bistro
when we placed our order the server was playing with his iphone while taking our drink_orders
i thought this was a bit rude but he explained that they have an app to place orders
pretty cool
we started_off_with a salty mango_lassi which was delicious
for our main_course we ordered the indian sampler
that featured garlic_naan
veg pakodas
chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
tandoori_chicken
mixed veg curry
lentils
yogurt
rice
and a milky rice_pudding
khir
we liked the idea of having a little taste of everything and boy did we
the food was outstanding
but the servings were kind of small
i was satisfied
but my boyfriend could have eaten more
they did bring out more rice when they saw we were getting low
tip
they also serve halal meats and they will call a cab for you when your meal is over
ahhh
las_vegas
being from another city
i imagined the entire culinary landscape bereft of anything not bearing crab legs or all_you_can_eat prime rib
i'm not sure why i had this thought
but i did
i admit it
however
thanks to the aggregated ratings and reviews of my fellow internet users
my wife and i discovered this assumption shattering tastiness
it's a great location
away from the strip
and the interior is classy and understated
though to be fair
being understated is easy to do in a city full of flashing lights and incessant beeping
sure
we waited a bit
but it was saturday_night
the food more than made up for it
we had a sampler platter
which came with garlic_nan
delicious tandoori_chicken
daal
biryani
and yogurt
everything was prepared with delicacy and care
and as a regular consumer of indian food
i was more than pleased with the quality
next time i go back
i will have to try out some of the nepalese selections available
they looked amazing
significantly more enticing than endless prime rib
it was kind of freaky walking in at
pm to an empty restaurant
but we braved it and stayed
and it was wonderfully yummy
like sara m
i also thought our waiter was being kind of rude playing with his phone when he approached our table to take our order
but i realized he was using his phone for ordering
what a cute little trick
i'm glad i refrained from scolding him before i knew what he was doing
because i know you never want to piss off your waiter before you get your food
we had the normal stuff garlic_naan
saag_paneer
and chicken_tikka_masala and a large kingfisher
all was so great
we are looking_forward to coming_back next year
the only disappointment was that the naan was not part of the meal
we had to order it separately
and they gave_us a double order because we both said naan
we ate lots of naan
'erp
and the restaurant did get busier
more tables walked in after us
it was a monday
after all
service was extremely polite as well
we hope to see you next year
mint
so please don't close
great service and food was fantastic
lunch buffet is a bit small
but well worth it
definitely one of my favorite lunch spots
not worth the trouble
the wait here is crazy and the service is mediocre
the food was good
although spicier than i am used to
i think i'll stick with india_palace instead
they have better food and better service
our absolute favorite lunch spot
we go almost every week and it's always busy and delicious
the naan is amazing and the lunch buffet is amazing
we will miss our weekly indian food lunch
love the buffet
have not ordered anything from the menu
but really love the buffet too much to try anything else
the food is great
and i love the fusion of
what i believe to be chow mein with tandoor chicken and spices
everything tastes fresh
and the service is friendly
a must try if you enjoy indian_buffets
i went into this place mainly because it was not too far away from my hotel and a quick glance of reviews that told me that this place was going to be ok
this place serves a combination of indian and nepali food
nepali food gets branded as indian food even though i feel that nepali food is more lamb and lentil
pulse
based
i loved their unique drink menu
i don't think i have seen spiked lassis before and that definitely was the highlight of my eating activity there
we ordered sambosas for appetizer followed by a few vegetarian entries
food overall tasted real good and the spice_level was almost to the level we ordered
one was ordered spicy and was mostly spicy and the other was mild
i will definitely stop here on my next trip_to_vegas
another lunch for please
i went here on a tuesday for the
lunch buffet
i got
basmati_rice
good
garlic_naan
good
chicken_tikka_masala
cubed chicken_breast was a bit on the dry side
chicken tandori
flavorful
chicken pakoda
basically battered
fried chicken
i can't remember_the_name of the noddles i had
but they were vegetarian and super spicy
all in all
it was alright
good variety of items
with descriptions of what sauces they would go well with and if they were vegan vegetarian
mint_indian_bistro is an interesting spot
it's not like most indian places i'm used to
a little more upscale
a little more gourmet
a little more
well
different
my paradigm for indian food is
in general
that the best food comes from the dingiest places so a proportionally inverse relationship between the fanciness of the decor and the quality of the food
from the standpoint of taste
when i walked in to mint i immediately formed an impression about what i was going to eat
and i was not too surprised in the end
just glad to have some decent indian food since i come from a place that has none
the food at mint falls into the higher end category better meats
obviously more hand made sauces
etc
not as dirty
earthy
pungent
and 'street' as the style that really rocks my socks
but it's good nonetheless
and sticks fairly well to form as being actual indian and not fusion
which is what i tend to see at higher end indian places
i sampled the chicken_vindaloo
which at a half order contained a surprising amount of tender
succulent chicken but not the same amount of potatoes that i'm used to
it has a decent heat to it but not quite the
fiery descent
that's comically described on the menu
the saag_paneer is quite nice
with a less 'spinach y' flavor than i'm used to
a much more subtle and balanced version of the heady green beast
the name of our third curry escapes me a blond affair with veggies
nice and creamy and delicious probably my favorite of the three
paired up with a bowl of basmati_rice and a basket of roti
half sized
oz
dishes makes for a beyond filling meal for two
props for offering half size portions
if only the price were half too
the drinks list is mighty impressive
with a very extensive beer_selection
some fun cocktails including a whole spate of flavored lassi offerings
and of course wine
my rose vodka lassi was interesting
tasted like rose
and the mango rum is exactly what you'd_expect
three half plates
roti and two lassi cocktails came to a sum total of
kind of a lot for the amount of food
but definitely a higher quality of ingredients than i'm used to seeing in the street indian i usually seek out
the experience
including the impeccable service
also adds in to the value
papadam to start
clean plates to transition from papadam to meal
and constantly full waters
this is probably the largest departure from the dirty hole_in_the_wall spots i hit in sf for my sub continent fix
i'd definitely come back after spending some more time exploring indian options in lv
i love the lunch buffet
tons of food and i like that they bring out fresh naan
the chicken masala and basmati_rice are my favorites
the only thing that is lacking is true raita
they have yogurt_sauce but it's just not the same
so i have to go to india_palace for my raita fix
still very good
friendly prompt service
every so often i hopefully check to see if has reopened and end up here
it does quite nicely
delicious
interesting selection of indian and belgian beers
gluten_free and vegetarian vegan_options
chicken_vindaloo and buttered naan highly_recommended
friendly_and_attentive service
eh
nothing screams
i must come back here
was anything wrong
not really
was anything great
yes
fresh naan of your choice
but now do we go to indian_restaurants for the naan alone
no
they have a lot of vegan choices on the buffet
which i certainly wasn't there for
i enjoyed their version of chicken_tikka_masala
it was lighter
had chunks of tomato in it
i didn't feel super guilty eating it
my husband did not like it as much as the creamier versions
i enjoyed the chicken chili
nice and spicy
first time i ever had chicken chili at an indian restaurant
the restaurant was clean
with newer furniture
so anyhow
we will not be back
there are at least two other indian_restaurants in vegas that my husband and i prefer
check it out if you feel like it
if you don't
no loss
food was good
but the service took forever
portions weren't very big either was excited to go after reading all the reviews
and instead got on the road back to cali pretty late and still hungry
maybe save this place for a night you're still in vegas instead of on the way out
stopped by mint based_on the reviews here while in vegas
interesting menu
want it with meat
vegan
just vegetarian
just ask
so i tried some things i don't usually order at other indian_restaurants a noodle dish called chau_chau
rebel chicken curry
and dal soup
everything was very good very different mix of spices than i'm used to at other indian_restaurants
and obviously freshly prepared
the only negative was that one person in my party ordered channa_masala mild
and it came out quite spicy
and she wimped out and didn't send it back
it was a good experience for me and my family
we tried the lunch buffet
the food was good and was quite cheap
i never really had indian food in vegas
but wanted to try some nice place
the reviews for this place and tamba were nice
but wanted to find some place off the strip and with easy parking so picked mint
the place looks little shady from outside
the plaza was dark and the restaurant did not seem very brightly lit from outside
but don't worry it's a great place from inside
the decor is nice and upscale
it's a quite place
with comfortable seating
the lights could be brighter
there were few other table's occupied
all by indians
a good sight if_you_are_looking for true indian spicy food and not tamed down for the american population
the waiter was nice
pleasant and took out his iphone while talking to us
realized within minutes he was noting down our order with an app from the app store
also said they own a software company and are going to start using their own app in some time
coming to the main part
food
it was really good
we ordered mint lassi and masala chhas
both were very indian and really tasty
their menu is very well organized
great for vegetarians and vegans since each item says if its good for vegetarians or vegans
very happy to see how they describe each item in the menu really well
one of the best organized menu's among all restaurants
comparing to all indian
american etc
restaurants
for the main_course we ordered paneer makhani
daal makhani and chole with naans
everything was really good
daal was very tasty
although the color might make you think its not the best
but trust_me the taste is nothing short of what you find back home
naan's were also very good
they also have nepalese food but did not try it
but would love to try that too
overall great place if_you_are_looking for true indian food
would_definitely_go_back again
i only like this place because i am indian and they serve good authentic_indian_food
haha
nice decor
ok service
example
we ordered extra rice and our waiter forgot about us and we had to ask the next waiter who wandered by minutes_later if he could bring us some
tasty food
i'm not too sure on the value as my husband and i shared the indian sampler plate which was all pretty tasty
but wasn't exactly a ton of food for two people
even though the menu indicated it would be plenty
but maybe i'm just used to having tasty leftovers to take home when i go out for indian
hmm
i'm gonna have to update my review after i try the buffet
because i've heard good things
for now
mint remains a solid option for indian food in vegas
but nothing really mind blowing
if you are in vegas and looking for indian food and don't go here you're not living life correctly
went for lunch buffet
it's great
lots of food selection
they even have lamb and it's cook and seasoned nicely
and different kind of hot soup
they only thing that i didn't like about the naan is that it's a bit under cooked
looks really white and i like my naan to be brown
slightly burned
i went there for launch
their service was very good
they greet and sit me right away and cleared the empty dishes of my table every time i had finished unlike many places that let it linger there forever
although it was a buffet
the food was fresh and tasty
they offered good selection of vegetarian and meet items
in general the atmosphere in that place is good
i will go back
i gave them only four stars because i went for their launch buffet not dinner
therefore
it will be wrong for me to give them full credit
but i might will
after i'll go there for dinner
we made a reservation last_night for pm on the opentable app while we were out running errands
when we arrived
every table was full and the manager expressed that he thought the reservation was for
i pulled up the email and he apologized profusely
they seated us to the side with menus while they figured out where to put us
the manager continuously apologized and we were seated within minutes of our reservation
with drinks
which we ordered while we were waiting
and papadum arriving quickly
my husband is still coming to terms with indian food
he was convinced he hated it when what he really dislikes is curry
so he's been slowly discovering things that aren't curry
so we ordered the indian sampler to give him the widest range of options
at least one other reviewer suggested that this wasn't enough food for two
but we found it to be more than worthwhile
true
there were no leftovers
but that isn't what we were expecting
the tray is artfully presented
each item comes in its own small
circular metal container with naan in the center and extra rice on the side
the containers are easy to pick_up
which is really useful when sharing
there isn't really enough naan for two
but our second order came out fast and warm
everything expect the vegetable_curry was a little mild for my taste
but that was the price i paid for sharing with someone who asked for medium
i had the lychee rum lassi
i really like the idea of alcoholic lassis
but the lychee flavor was a little mild
i think i'll start with a stronger base flavor next time
lychee was too delicate
i had the lunch buffet a while ago and came back based_on that
it was definitely worth it
they did rush us out without be drink menu i asked for after we finished our khir
but when i saw the grandmas in saris sitting outside in a line about five tables deep
i decided that my darjeeling would be just as good brewed at home
they were apparently the place to be on christmas eve
i came here for the great lunch buffet we have been hearing about on yelp
let me say it is true
great service and a great line of food
the salads were great
but do not be tricked with the spiciness of some of the peppers
i was tricked by thinking it was a bell pepper
but after five minutes of crying
i have learned my lesson to chew more no matter how hungry you are
the curries were delectable
the goat was especially wonderful
the soups were good
my favorite was the tomato
the others made me feel like it was lacking something
the naan was great
the misses liked the garlic one while i liked the original
although we came early
before they opened
they let us come inside away from the cold and sit while they finished preparing the buffet for us
the service was wonderful
i love how their menus have descriptions of everything
from the ingredients to the drinks to the little anecdotes about how particular drinks were not really indian
when i come back to vegas and i am craving indian
i am coming_back to this place again
if you like indian food
you must try this place out
best indian lunch buffet you'd every get for

the variety is unbelievable
including several chicken and lamb dishes but also many vegetarian ones
i've_never_seen an indian buffet with that big of a spread
there is also a salad_bar
everything was delicious
the garlic_naan was out_of_this_world
the chicken curry and fried chicken
strip
were very yummy and the chicken tandoori was the best i've ever had
they even have desserts
love
love_this_place
you will
too
dinner review
excellent staff humble
paid the right amount of attention to me
excellent food
i had the sauteed cauliflower and potato vegetarian dish
try the esh
a german beer a strong beer with a very smooth taste
simply just delicious indian food
the owner kris is very attentive
unbelievably great indian restaurant
hip
classy
reasonably_priced
and the food is outstanding
everything in this place is really well put together
even the menu is a delight to read
the beverage section says something like
while we're waiting for the himalayan snow to melt
perhaps you'd enjoy some of our other water selections
the indian sampler was so tasty
with a wide_variety of dishes and perfect proportions
the perfect dish for a first date
the mango_lassi was flavorful but not too sweet
the organic tomato_soup is unlike any tomato_soup i've ever had
the owner stopped by our table
and it was clear how much pride and thought he had put into the restaurant
i plan to return to mint_indian_bistro every time i go back to las_vegas
the food here is absolutely_delicious
i highly_recommend the lunch buffet
since you get to try so many of their dishes
as a vegetarian semi vegan
i also appreciate the variety of veg options available
as well as the labels they have on the buffet line noting if foods are vegetarian or vegan
the staff is very nice as well
recently my boyfriend and i arrived just before the lunch buffet was scheduled to close
but they said we could do the buffet anyway
and even brought us some vegan naan
solid stars
is nice to get away from the strip if you're there for an entire week
the ambiance here is great
very calm and the service is great
they are so high tech
the waiter took our orders with his iphone and it was submitted into the kitchen
he said the owner created an app
genius
you can never go wrong with tikka masala
we came here for dinner with a party of five
no buffet a la_carte
we ordered an assortment of dishes
but my favorite was the tikka masala with garlic_naan
i also ordered the peach lassi
which was pretty good
it tasted like a peach yoplait
hahaha
oh
i forgot to mention
but they have a great
extensive selection of alcoholic beverages
the best indian food i've had in las_vegas so far
don't_get_me_wrong
mint bistro's food is not the best indian food one can find
but well above
for instance
gandhi indian_bistro
which is just a short distance to the west
four stars is probably a little high for the food
more like three and one half
the cons
in every chicken dish that i've tried
the chicken is overcooked
i routinely expect that in chicken tandoori
but not in tikka masala
or even the chicken chili at mint_bistro
additionally
the food is definitely toned down for american tastes
i have to load up on the chili paste at the salad_bar
i do the recommend the chutneys here
all of them but especially the mint and coconut chutneys
the service and smiles on the staff merit five_stars
i like to see happy people in a restaurant
that makes me believe the management cares enough to consistently produce a good product
finally
the beer_selection is very good
though for some odd reason
mint_bistro carries no american beers
not even some of the premium micro brews
i definitely recommend mint_bistro and my criticisms are only offered in the hope that the management will strive to improve the minor deficiencies i have listed
this place is not to shabby
went for the lunch buffet which was good
the quality of the food was pretty good
the service was great
wish they had more of a variety
meaning not the same type of food everyday
ate here about different times
the naan here seems to be doughy
its a thick piece
im not sure if they make it like this because they are from a different region but i've had some where it was more on the thinner side
wouldn't mind coming here again
definitely enjoyed my food here
lunch buffet is relishing here
each dish has its own richness
also
versatile range of buffet dishes allows you pamper your cravings to the core
right from the ambience to the food
its worth to be there
good work
this is a nice little indian restaurant not far from the strip
the decor is hip
the workers are polite
and the lunch buffet is delicious
the price is
and they usually have a good variety of indian dishes
if they have tikka masala
it is usually watered_down
but everthing else is good
especially the chicken pakora
i like the salad area
where they have some nice chutneys
the nan is good
but they don't always ask if you want more
and sometimes they get busy and don't refill your water
and if you have a burn going
that could be dangerous
of all the indian_restaurants near the strip
this is probably the best
this place can get full very fast
because it is small
parking is not so good
as it is in a busy little strip of stores
they open at
enjoy
this place wasn't mint when i originally reviewed it so it isn't fair that they get the reviews grandfathered to them when this business was called
himalayan something something
decent buffet
stars if you eat meat but if you don't
they do offer a few unique dishes i don't see at any other indian buffet like their version of lo mein
chaat and kinds of naan and soup
i just prefer the overall selection a little more at other places
move over namaste there is a new indian buffet champ in town or maybe i'm just way too late discovering
i knew i was in the right place when we walked in to a filled up buffet at pm saturday
hall full of indians
they brought us a pitcher of water and asked what kind of naan we'd like between regular
butter
or garlic
i know a few places that bring your naan fresh table side but this is the first that offers you a selection
their buffet selections also provided some refreshing new items such as the their chicken chili
a saag which wasn't your standard spinach but a combination of flavorful veggies
and a ridciculously tasty goat_curry which i proceeded to get plates of
i passed out for hours after eating their buffet and can't wait to use my restaurant
com_coupon for dinner as you can't use for their_lunch_buffet
i was thoroughly impressed with their buffet and know dinner will only be better
definitely check it out
came here ny day to celebrate my friends engagement
kind of a random location
but not far from the tuscany
which i love
had the lunch buffet and everything was very good
there were also a lot of indian people
so you know that's a good sign too
they have a little bit of everything to suit all tastes and spice_levels
i love the mint
not much to say that hasn't already been said
many vegetarian and vegan_options
and labelled as such
the menu itself is an enjoyable read very cleverly written
my most recent visit was on valentines day
when they had a pre fixe menu which was a four course meal with several options for each course
at per_person
not including drinks
this was a more expensive meal than the usual dinner here
if anything
there was too much food
but i love leftovers for breakfast
so i'm okay with that
the meal was delicious as always
the waitstaff friendly and prompt especially considering how slammed they were on this big dining out night
two special little treats were the rose mintini a slightly sweet
rose flavored cocktail that was a perfect compliment to the spicy fare and the kulfi
which was a cardamom flavored cross between rice_pudding and ice_cream
extremely rich and flavorful
it was served in tiny cups
but was creamy and wonderful and just the perfect treat to end a lovely meal
my husband and i went here for valentine's day while in las_vegas
we were blown_away with how amazing our night was
the service is nonpareil
before we even arrived at the restaurant
someone gave_us a call to let us know that the menu was prix fixe and wanted to let us know that we can look on the website to make sure that we were still interested
and
once there
the staff were all very attentive and we didn't have to wait long for any of our courses to come
there are many vegetarian_options and each course was
quite easily
the best indian food that we've ever had
the mango_lassi is also quite enjoyable
we will definitely always come back to mint whenever we're in the area
this restaurant is a gem
the daily brunch is a steal
it includes a variety of meat vegetarian entrees from throughout india and nepal
while many others already have reviewed this restaurant
since this is possibly my favorite restaurant
i wanted to add my applause
taj_palace is still my favorite although this is the only comparison i have
mint doesnt have as many vegetarian_options as taj_palace who offers about options including a salad_bar
i was disappointed that mint didnt offer any lentil dishes and the naan wasn't as great as everyone posted
my fianc who is the meat_eater wasn't too fond of the goat_curry and prefers taj palaces chicken_tiki_masala
overall
it was a good place to try for indian food and was crowded for saturday lunch buffet so that has to say something but we'll stick to taj_palace for our indian fix
great place to sit_down and enjoy great quality food
new menu and great selections are now available
was not too impressed with the service this time
usually pretty good yet today was rather disappointed
very good food and prompt service
lamb khorma is amazing
waiter had exceptional recommendations and could explain the spicy index to my wife
ask about the beers bc they are unique
out of all the indian_restaurants in the las_vegas area this one is my favorite
i have never had a dish that i didn't love and service has always been great
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
tons of vegetarian and vegan_options
tons of chicken and lamb options
if you have never tried indian food
there are several options that will get you introduced to it with familiar flavors
they really do have something for everyone
they have easy to read descriptions and so many different flavors to choose and love
they only think that isn't stars is the cocktail menu
the descriptions are nice but the flavor is just ok
stick to the virgin lassi or their nice beer_selection for better options
it has been fairly or very quiet every time i have gone and the service is always friendly and excellent
you can control the spice of your food as well on a to scale
i usually go with an or depending_on the dish
good spice with excellent flavor
great for a date_night or to try somewhere new
food is every time
drinks are to and service has been every time so a it is for being the best_indian_food_in_vegas
the food was pretty good
the dosa and nan were very good
the lamb_vindaloo and chicken_tiki_masala were just okay
certainly not bad but not the best i have tried for sure
the service was very slow
it took minutes from when we ordered to get our food
that's not an exaggeration
we had dinner at mint tonight and it was amazing
we had a few items
potato and pea samosas these were ok
a little too much seasoning for my liking
vindaloo
chicken thighs
full portion very good with a tomato base
it was a great recommendation by the waiter
tikka masala
chicken
our favorite this was the best tikka masala we have ever had
it was absolutely_delicious
we also had a full portion of this
garlic_naan also so yummy
between all of this food
my hubby and i were stuffed
we could have even passed on the samosas and been more than full
the staff was also very attentive
and although the restaurant was packed
we only waited about minutes for a table
overall
thanks yelpers for all the great reviews
it was a fantastic choice for dinner
best indian buffet in las_vegas and top ten in the country yes indeed
good selection but much more authentic than the usual buffet fare and the honey ball desert is to die for
did i mention the endless naan
this place was so good
the decor was chic and the service staff was very nice and helpful
the menu was huge
sometimes a bad sign
but everything we ordered every dish that passed our table looked and smelled delicious
we had been craving_indian_food
so before we stepped foot in the restaurant
we already knew we were going to order momo and chicken_tikka_masala
lucky for us
wednesday happened to be chicken_tikka_masala night
which means if we bought one
we'd get the nd one half off
you can choose the level of spiciness you prefer
along with the naan
this meal really hit_the_spot
i'm not from the area
but i will definitely come back here anytime i'm in vegas again just to try more tasty dishes
especially those on the prix fixe menu
their buffet was the best amongst all in the sin city
ambience and service was good and timely
i am from nj and an indian
nj has large indian population
but there are only two restaurants that are good
i moved to lv two years_ago and i had been trying out different indian_restaurants for sometime
when i went to mint for first time i thought that this was best indian restaurant in lv apart from namaste
i just could not believe that i've not written a review on this
so
here is my experience from last weekend
last weekend i went to mint with my friends and my gf
some of them had never been to indian restaurant
they were excited_to_try it out
so we ordered the following
shrimp khadhai
chicken_tikka
lamb rebel curry
butter naan
my gf's favorite
bhathura
daal mahkhni
lentils
chicken_biryani
fried_rice
chaat appetizer
we ordered everything very spicy and it was delicious
specially the shrimp khadhai
my mouth is watering just writing about it
also
the free basmati_rice that comes with the curries is very delicious and smells amazing
all the curries were amazing
the chicken_biryani was little over cooked
but it was spiced well
my_only_complaint that i would have is that their full size portions are very small
and their full size portions are way smaller than their some restaurant's half sized
now i know its a good trick to get your customers to buy more food
but i think they should be honest on their serving size
final bill was plus tip for people
not that bad
but we had to order more food and we did not order any alcohol
positives
delicious food
good ambiance
negatives
prices seem unreasonably high for the quantity of food
i guess that's what happenes when a restaurant gets famous
overall
its just as good as namaste if not better
p
s
their_lunch_buffet is good
but its not as good when you order of the menu
good food lunch buffet has food value
staff is helpful and polite
worth trying
everytime i drive out to vegas i have to stop here
bar none
the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had and well
i'm a vegetarian
i eat a lot of indian food
the greatest thing is they have all regions of indian food so
you don't have to pick just one
you can have them all
plus
the wait_staff is super_nice and willing to chat with you about the food
it's a little bit pricey
but even for the frugalest person it's worth every stinkin penny
the place smells great when you go inside
some of the best tarka dal i have ever had
my karia was good
not spicy enough my friend had chicken vinaloo which was also tasty
the service was at a glacial pace
my fave spot
we love their buffet options
they cater to your needs and service was superb
i have yet to try their dosa buffet on sundays
maybe soon
hands_down
mint_indian_bistro is the best_indian_food_in_vegas
i'm originally from sf
i'm indian
and have been searching for a good indian_restaurant_in_vegas for years
mint has authentic
fresh
some organic
and most_importantly
amazing flavors that give me the perfect curry fix
if i'm too lazy to cook myself
the service and team there is also very nice and attentive
great servers
delicious food
outstanding owner
the food and service was wonderful
we had the vegan sampler for
way too much food and left very happily full
highly_recommended
after reading all the good reviews we came here because my wife was in the mood for indian food
its not a big restaurant and it is a buffet
the mother's day special included a mango_lassi
yum
and a dolsa
a rolled up pancake with lentil in the middle
the cold bar had varius kinds of churney
a salad
some fruit
and other sauces
there were also different kinds of soup
a tomato_soup that tasted a bit sour
a lentil based soup
and a spicy soup
its got a lot of the standard indian_fare
what stood_out to me was the goat_curry
the goat meat was fall off the bone tender and the curry had an excellent flavor
also
the tandoori_chicken was nice and juicy
not dry like a lot of other joints
the paneer sagg
a spinach and cheese dish
was also pretty good
there were some vegetarian_dishes but being the carnivore that i am
i did not partake
i got a taste_of_india without blowing out my palate on ridiculously spicy food
that makes this a decent restaurant in my book
my fianc wanted to go to this place and i was a little nervous at first since i have not had not been to a good indian_buffet_in_town and i had given up trying
i was really surprised when we got here though
first all of the food looked really fresh
not like it had been made earlier this week and was reheated
everything was very tasty and not spicy
i really enjoyed their mint_chutney
spinach
pakora
tiki_masala
goat
and garlic_naan
yes i did eat all of that for lunch
i know i'm a fatty
only giving it star for no samosas and the service was kind of lacking
good food both in quality and taste
the staff is friendly a well
there used to be a couple of wonderful nepalese restaurants in the detroit metro area
and i've missed them sorely since they closed
mint's nepalese offerings made this a must stop place during business pleasure trips to vegas
and i've been here several times
this latest visit in may of found mint as more fusion oriented than i remembered it
they appear to have dropped some of the nepalese dishes
which made me sad
however
we found a great deal at mint to be happy about
lassi bar
both my husband's mint lassi
not sweet
and my blackcurrant lassi
sweet
were sublime
the color
the flavor
and the texture were all just perfect
we did not have liquor in either lassi
drinks list is extensive
with many beers i remember fondly from my visits
including a wonderful lambic
a beer named
troubadour obscura
and a bock that is probably one of the best beers i've ever tasted
diverse menu mostly indian with some chinese
tibetan
and nepalese influenced dishes with many can't fail choices
i've enjoyed the
rebel curry
on a previous visit
but this time we had the momos delicate meat filled dumplings similar to a potsticker
served with a spicy tomato based sauce
i had the tamarind rice
a vegetarian offering that worked well as an entree after the course of momos
my husband had the chicken chau_chau one of the tibetan noodle dishes and a bowl of the delicious noodle soup
i had the warm sweet carrot_halwa for dessert and my husband had kulfi
our two fellow guests
both newcomers to tibetan and nepalese food
both enjoyed the chau_chau with shrimp and the lamb momos
service was spotty the server had to be asked three times to provide lemon wedges for our water
and frequently missed at least one person at our four person table when providing refills or removing dishes
and during almost every course beer
entree
dessert we encountered the news that something we'd ordered wasn't available at that moment
no ras malai or hakka noodles
so each of were eating and drinking our
second best
picks for at least one course out of the menu
the dessert i ordered wasn't available and the server took it upon himself to bring me out mango kulfi instead
which was a nice gesture but a terrible idea
as i am allergic to mangoes and had previously indicated i did not want mangoes in my iassi
dishes are presented attractively on four cornered white plates but presentation isn't really exceptional
in spite of these hiccups
we had a very good time
which goes to show how excellent the food and drink here are
next_time_i'm_in_vegas
i'll be heading to flamingo rd for another lassi and a plate of momos
cool half moon booths
great service and attentiveness of staff
food was solid all around
extensive_menu
including jain
gluten_free
vegan
vegetarian_options
i had the lamb_vindaloo which i give a out of town
naan was good
the owner was very interested in feedback and once he found out how much i love vindaloo asked me to come back and try it after he made some subtle changes to improve it
orders were taken on ipads
i will_be_coming_back
had a great experience overall
tandoori_chicken was way too dry
definitely not cooked the same day
the easiest curry ctm was very disappointing
i am not coming again
the advent and subsequent proliferation of the indian buffet has been a boon to america
even back in my homeland of kansas i was only blocks away from one
mint_indian_bistro fills the gap that my recent relocation created
their masalas and curries are great and genuinely spicy
they also have just as many vegetarian_options as they do options for carnivores
which is a plus
it also helps that these vegetarian_options are tasty
avoid any of their sauced dishes described as
bone in
or
with bone
bone shards can be found throughout these dishes
and while tasty
a bone can be a real turn off texture wise if you don't break a tooth on it
that said
this is a minor downside
notes
baskets of naan like baskets of chips at a mexican restaurant
oh hell yes
also
paneer varies from restaurant to restaurant
the paneer at mint_indian_bistro is like a firm tofu
which is my favorite style of paneer
those of you preferring a creamier paneer are officially on notice
for you'd have a hard time finding a better buffet to embarrass yourself at in vegas
we stopped in for their_lunch_buffet while visiting my sister who lives in vegas
great food
great ambience
friendly
efficient staff
will_definitely_go_back next time we're in town
love_this_place
our new favorite great food and service
good selection of good items on their_lunch_buffet
servers were attentive but not overwhelming
we had a large_group of about
we called several days ahead to let them know we were coming
they did a great job even when we requested split checks which they graciously accommodated
a good mix of mild and spicy items to choose from on the lunch buffet
and all is labeled including some suggestions for accompaniments
i will recommend this to coworkers who may want to try something different for lunch
great indian and nepalese menu great atmosphere
first class service and dishes not found in many reaturants
las_vegas offers great restaurants
i would say this is definately worth a visit
a long overdue update about mint short and sweet
but well deserved
mint have clearly listened to the feedback from yelp over the last couple of years
what we have now is a well rounded
extremely consistent buffet and a comprehensive menu ready to cater to every food preference
at
for buffet it's no wonder that this place can have a queue out the door around lunchtimes
plenty of delicious fare to choose from and some vegetarian_options for my wife
oh
and garlic_naan that's among the finest in the valley
don't miss out
yummy indian food and very good service
i work for an indian company and have traveled to india in the past and enjoy the cuisine
mint has a daily buffet that runs
and is well_stocked
you can also go ala_carte if you like
the service is good and they are fast
tables move quickly and its a good place for families with kids as well
overall a good place
went on a recommendation of a friend in our dining party
who had heard of mint via word of mouth but also had never been himself either
located in an unassuming strip_mall
mint is somewhat of a buried treasure in vegas
we went for dinner and were seated in a spacious booth
the restaurant itself was almost packed at
pm
the menu itself is extensive
but also descriptive and keyed for vegetarian_vegan items
gluten_free
spicy
etc
very impressive regional beer_selection
i had never tried indian beers before
our party of three enjoyed the garlic_naan
vegatable samosas
and the crispy flatbread that was brought to the table was toasted perfectly
for our mains
we enjoyed chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_biryani
rogan_josh
with lamb
and i loved loved loved the buttered masala_dosa i ordered
i had been craving a proper dosa for months
various chutneys were brought to the table as well
all of the items were delivered with good timing
and were all equally delicious with tender chicken and lamb
at the time of your order you can designate how spicy you'd prefer your meat curry dishes
on a scale of
our server was hilariously talking us into spicier levels and we were glad we agreed with his recommendations in the end
we ended with the small dessert offerings of which i can't remember_the_name but all were lovely and petite
served in tall shotglasses it seemed
total bill for three adults with one alcoholic drink and one soda with tax
mint is definitely a jewel hidden in the vegas rough
we will be back indefinitely
if not on this trip
then the next
both the lunch buffet and the menu_items are amazing
everything here is awesome
i'm a vegetarian
so i appreciate that everything on the buffet line and in the menu is labeled with whether it's vegetarian
vegan
gluten_free
etc
etc
to accommodate all kinds of diets
you won't regret eating here
oh yelp
you steered me wrong on this one
i feel pretty bad about it actually
because there are some things that mint really does right
unfortunately
few of these were related to the food itself
the good they bring you a carafe of water and leave it on the table so you can refill your own glass
this is really nice when eating spicy indian food
of which there was none here
the restaurant is very clean and attractive
the service is very friendly
they bring naan fresh to your table and the naan was good
the bad most of the buffet was bland
bland
bland
and i don't mean just 'not spicy' bland
but 'no flavor' bland
the tikka masala was gloppy
like the cream in it had curdled
but it had little flavor
i was sooo excited_to_see goat_curry
my_favorite_dish ever
on the buffet
but it was bland
bland
bland
the meat was good but the curry
nonexistant
the saag was downright horrible the worst i've ever had
everything tasted like they'd forgotten salt
and i don't like overly salted food
the creamy tofu curry had no flavor
the kheer was also pretty dreadful
they use rice angel hair instead of rice
so it had a slimy wormy consistency and the runny 'sauce' did not taste good
i usually love kheer but i took one bite and that's it
the indifferent the gulab_jamun was about average though i couldn't taste any cardamom in the simple syrup
which is a letdown
the dal was subtly flavored but not too bad
the best dishes on the buffet were the 'chili chicken'
tasted like mexican indian fusion but actually had some flavor
and the 'veggie chow chow' which is some sort of noodle dish that didn't really remind me of any indian food
but didn't taste bad
the buffet was about per_person
there were a surprising number of indo pak folks in here
surprising because of how bad the food was
normally at the places i frequent in other cities that have a lot of indo pak clientele
the food is very spicy and flavorful
sometimes too spicy for my pansy white arse even
but here
it was like the baby food bland version of everything
why were they here
is this really the best indian food available in vegas
i shudder to think that is the case
i hope they were just having a bad day but honestly the food wasn't good enough for me to want to find out
despite the nice touches of fresh naan and abundant water
feel
you enter this place and want to feel good about this place
good lighting comfortable seatings et all
good music
menu card
i love elaborate menus
ones which tell you details and makes you imagine and times salivate
this one takes it a step ahead it even details items like gluten_free
jain
halal etc
on for menu
service initial
the manager asks for scale of spiciness
the waiter clearly asks for water with ice or without it
how many indian place do so
and the good part ends there
rather miserably
my friends
veg asked for a thali for
question
how can a thali for have only nan
lamb lollypops
not well marinated and rubbery
we were asked to rate the level of spice in food
we asked for and got a
for food
there is an apt hindi saying
unchi dukaan feeka pakwan
only pomp and show but no content
a good reataurant has to be flexible
we asked for a thali which had kheer for dessert but we requested to substitute with gajar halwa
available on a different thali
the request was rudely turned down not by the steward but by the kitchen
we never got what we asked for
the waiter goofed up plain rice and jeera rice and tells us not to worry he will have the ticket updated
i love food and feel bad when my love for food is weighed in currency
service
this is a great little indian restaurant or maybe i've lost how to rate indian_restaurants since the indian_restaurants in austin just plain suck
at least most of them
the lunch buffet had a decent variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian_dishes
along with a salad_bar and two desserts
it was gulab_jamun and something else
i don't like desserts so i can't comment on them
the vegetarian_dishes
kadhai paneer
saag
mushroom potatoes
dal
sambar
idli
rasam
pulao were all great
in the non_veg section there was chicken_tikka_masala
chilli chicken
tandoori_chicken
goat_curry and another chicken dish
they all were great
i ate a bit of each coz it was that good
also they bring your choice of bread fresh at your table unlike other indian_restaurants who leave theirs at the buffet table
oh_yeah
if you're indian and drink iced cold water
you need to tell them that
the default water for us folks is warm water
great food
not too spicey
and i am not referring to indian spice_level
but very very tasty
kabob's are great
soft
and very tasty
this is one of the best food i have experienced in the usa
and the quality can be compared with one of the best in india
their beer collection is also very impressive
i haven't found that level of collection in any indian restaurant
in fact in any restaurant
the only reason i am not giving a five_star is because their service
we were kept waiting for beer and food and additional order at a time when there were not that many people in the restaurant
this place is off the strip
it's in a little strip_mall type and when you get there
you wonder what you will find
you walk in
and you still are not sure
but once you sit_down
the servers are just as friendly as can be
they are are ready to help you choose and tell you what you are eating
try one of the samplers with a friend
well worth it
when it started to come
there's a few courses
the server let us know what it was
the taste of all the foods we ate were wonderful
the servers were great
the location was good
the only down fall is that sometimes they took a while to get back to you once you had your food
the shittiest indian food you can get anywhere
being from india
i know what the food is supposed to taste like
the food never tastes fresh and mostly smells bad
the desserts being the major disappointment
the service is real poor and during buffets
u have to wait for ages for just the bread
the food overall seems to be cooked in a jiffy using cheap spices and paying minimum attention to taste
hygiene has been my major concern lately
as the food gave me a bad stomach
the website does not allow a negative rating
or i would have gone for that
a pleasant surprise in a town with a ton of mediocre overpriced restaurants
lunch buffet
including weekends
vegetarian_options galore
delicious food
best garlic_naan i've ever had
made fresh to order and included
constantly refilled carafes of water
instant hangover re hydration
comfy and clean atmosphere
my only complaints were that there were no samosas and that i couldn't order off the regular menu during buffet hours
while initially disappointed
the food on the buffet line was really great
we had a lunch buffet for on a friday afternoon
hard_to_find parking
it's in a small area
so walking just a couple min in fire bc you parked so far is a pain
clean
to my surprise
the restaurant is pretty elegant
nice plates and fancy cup glasses
comparing my experiences with indian_restaurants near uc davis
the food is not spicy at all
i was expecting it to be packed with flavor
but curries were nothing close
for my tastes
overall somewhat bland and dry
garlic_naan was great
fresh
but comes with a caveat
it takes forever for you to get some
although it is ayce
don't expect to be coming_back for more and more
not much of a selection to choose from so i would say at most plates
after a while
the food gets redundant
my husband and i went there last week because everyone had raved_about it
there was no parking and its in a very busy area
we went for the lunch buffet and despite the crowd it looked like everything had been sitting there a while
the desserts were just plain gross
i will give them credit for good naan_bread but it wasn't
to die for
and it took forever to get it
we were almost done before it was brought to our table
and to top it all off i got sick an hr after i ate there
it could have been an off day for them but i think i'll try to find a different indian place
this was our first time trying indian food and we are now huge fans
the flavors were delicious
the service was attentive
but not too pushy
we ordered the sampler for and we were able to try a bit of each of the popular dishes
we'll_definitely_be_back for more naan
all fire and no flavor
vindaloo was pretty hot
but no complexity
lunch buffet
dinner
i've done it all
i really like mint and all their veggie selections for us non meat_eaters
the menu is easy to navigate and is coded with abbreviations to let you know which is vegetarian friendly
gluten_free
etc
i usually opt for the aloo_gobi or the chana_masala with a side of garlic_naan and always end up leaving happy
like i mentioned earlier
i've stopped in a few times for the lunch buffet and always leave happy as well
they can a bunch of great choices for lunch and they always like to keep the
veggies
in mind with a bunch of meatless dishes which are all labeled
warmed up
and ready to go
definitely a favorite of mine and definitely a step up from the himalayan joint they used to be
coming_back soon and definitely coming_back hungry
my boyfriend and i love_this_place
yum
we will be bringing his parents back
they are indian so that means a lot
phenomenal
excellent portion_size and flavor through the roof
super courteous staff
menu is awesome so many options
vegetarian
vegan
gluten_free
lamb
fish
chicken
etc etc etc
and the price is right
enjoy
best_indian_food_in_vegas
i've lived in vegas for years
and before that in the bay_area
where u can find the best indian food
but it took me years
finally
no more eating this fake indian food in vegas
i was on a quest to find the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas which is easy and hard at the same time
it's easy to pick out the bad ones
and hard_to_find the exceptional ones
luckily
this is the exceptional one
this place hits all the positive points there are to hit
especially for lunch
service is good
the place is clean and well maintained
for lunch
their buffet is simply the best
there is quality
flavor
variety and value in what you pay
they're also strict on their health code
at least to the customers
they are watching like hawks for any plate re use
for dinner
i know foods aren't the same as they way they are served for lunch
and i haven't tried all of them
they're supposed_to_be better as they're supposed_to_be prepared fresh for you
the ones i have tried have been good and full of flavor and quality
the only thing to note is the absurd price of dinner entrees
like any indian place really
that's why i can't give it stars
i am utterly addicted to their_lunch_buffet
the food is fantastic
and the servers are very polite and professional
i love_this_place to death
one of the few places where you can still get an authentic multilayered whole_wheat paratha made on the tawa
indian girdle saucepan
as it should be and not in the tandoor
indian oven
makes all the difference in the taste
they serve the usual north_indian food plus south_indian fare also such as idlis
though biryani is a standard item on their menu the owner on occasion makes some biryani himself and i am keen on trying his biryani
service is very good and friendly
compared to most buffets
for lunch
of its kind i thought theirs is among the better ones i've come across
simply awesome food
manu covers almost everything
my friend took me here for the buffet the parking was tough and it doesn't_look_like much from the outside
once we got inside i was surprised to see how comfortable
clean and how friendly the employees were
i can see why it's tough to park everyone wants to eat here
the food was so fresh and delicious
the price is right too
they have the buffet days a week at the same price
that is impressive
i told my friends
my one friend took her husband and two sons
middle school
she said
they all enjoyed it very much
great find
the worst food and service ever
the rice was under cooked and the milk which was used for the mango shake was expired so they had to go back change it
after leaving
of our group had a very bad stomach ache
sounds too much right
well
after all that has been said
god is my witness
mediocre buffet disappointing experience
after looking at the yelp score on this restaurant we decided to visit it for buffet and ended_up with a major disappointment
if you don't want to experience below
don't visit this restaurant
inferior food quality most of the food items had poor preparation and lacked taste
poor selection of food items
low hygiene the place didn't look clean
the floor was dirty and i could notice food particles lying down the floor at several places
taste
not so good
i can get better food elsewhere in below average restaurants
there are several better places in vegas if you want to try out indian food
just avoid this one
oh wow
how do i describe this place
i've always said that any ethnic restaurant where people of that ethnicity fill the place must be either good or they pay a lot of people to sit in the window
in this case
it's the former
i went with an indian friend and she was in heaven
i've been to india a couple_of_times and the food here is as good as anything i had there
prices_are_reasonable
warning
if you order the inferno curry
the waiver isn't a joke
this curry is made with pure ghost peppers and it will take a half gallon of lasse to cool the burn
but it's delicious once the burn subsides
i loved it
in one word
go
great service
great food
great selection
our dinner party of four included a vegetarian
a gluten_free vegetarian
and low carb dieters
mint was made to order for us
you would never guess that the buckwheat naan was gluten_free
the vegetable_korma was delicately seasoned
creamy
but we asked for medium_spice
so it did have a little kick
the marinated vegetables cooked in a tandoor were spicy and smoky too much for one person
i hear the chicken tandoor dishes were delish too
we will return
thanks mint
awesome
first time ever eating indian food because i've always been afraid
but the only word that comes to mind about my experience is awesome
the chile chicken and lentel soup appetizers were perfect
and the main_course dip like stuff was all seasoned perfectly
i can't_speak for it myself but i also hear the lunch buffet is fantastic
i hate buffets
ever since i was about years old and ate a horrific piece of cold fried chicken at the circus circus buffet
i pretty much avoid them unless they're being paid for or someone i know really wants to go with them
for a while this even extended it to restaurants i liked or cuisines i enjoyed that offered buffets
i would skip those and order a la_carte
with my recent love for mt everest's lunch buffet and my complete obsession over indian food in general
i figured it was time to venture out and try another
i'm ridiculously smart for this decision
because mint blew me away at lunch today
we were seated and offered a choice of naan and i ordered an iced_tea before going up to grab a plate
naturally i skipped over the fruits and veggies on the first cart and went right to the rice
pakoras
and varieties of dals
curries
and chicken dishes
first thing i noticed that i appreciated wholly was that each item had notations on whether they were vegan
vegetarian
had glucose
or had jain
one of the friendly servers heard my friend and i seemingly confused over what that even was and she explained it
people who dont cant eat garlic or onions
perish the thought
i annoyed her with my lactose intolerance issue as i do everyone that i encounter in a food establishment
but still took my chances with just about anything that didn't say
paneer
on it
my goal at indian_buffets now is to never return for a nd plate
of course this just means that i have a mountain of food on my one and only plate
and mint was no exception
if i went back for seconds they probably would have closed down for the day
pretty sure i was triple stacking items and just letting them all ooze together
it's like an fountain drink suicide indian style
the only negative i can think of on selection this day was no samosas
seemed like a greek joint without falafels
got back to the table with my iced_tea waiting and a basket of fresh
hot naan followed shortly_after
every_single bite was delicious
i wish i could go into greater detail on each component
but it wouldnt be adequate
i probably had different items on my plate
and i repeat
every bite was delicious
price was standard and worth_every_penny
one final exemplary service note which might have just been circumstantial
but on the receipt it noted that the naan was with
no butter
i think the woman that was working at the front of the line may have informed our waiter to hold the butter on the naan as she overheard the two lactose intolerant weirdos in line discussing it
way to make us feel welcomed
gotta go on this one
though i'm starting to wonder if there are any indian_restaurants here in town i dont like
amazing food and excellent service
off the strip so it's quiet
so
i went here with one of my friends and i was really excited for the place
we are seated relatively quickly and it takes awhile to finally get menus from our waiter
that did not really bother me too much
but
it gets better
after ordering a series of dishes
it takes unusually longer than it should have
and
when we got our food
there was hair in the chicken_tikka_masala and rice
yes three hairs in each one
i was shocked and disgusted at this
we immediately inform the staff of this and receive a half baked apology
but
they replace it with no problem
we get the food back
but now our naan is cold
so
we ask for the naan to be warmed or get new naan
they oblige and we get new naan
my friend takes a bite into his potatoes that we got and there yet again another hair
but
this one being smaller
i have never been to place that allows its cooks to leave hair in the food
it is very careless of them
i was expecting amazingly service
but was met with subpar service
i expected amazing food
but i was met with hair in the food
i will not be back here
too gross to eat hair in the food
foodies beware
wonderful food and service
the buttered garlic_naan is the best
my_favorite_dish is the malai_kofta and the lassi menu has every flavor imaginable
i tried the rose lassi and it was delicious
was here over a great weekend where we saw peter gabriel at planet hollywood and the beatles love show by cirque du soleil
we could have eaten anywhere on the strip
but chose mint based upon their menu and reviews
we came in late
after love and were seated
the gentleman who came over to our table was a joy
asking us what we might like
the level of spice we may want in our food
etc
he is the owner
the menu_is_extensive
northern
southern_indian with himalayan foods offered
as well
i asked for his help in navigating the menu and he guided us brilliantly
the food
service and experience was one that i will repeat every time i am in vegas
it was that good
very nice place
good waiters
nice food
lunch buffet is each
eat as much as you like
meat is halal
awesome
possibly the best indian food i have had in vegas so far
i had the rebel curry
which while not being spicy at all was very tasty
my friend had the chana_masala
we also split a couple different kinds of naan
i thought the dining_area was nice
the lights were dim and the tables were spread out enough that it was pretty quiet in there
we also tried a few different deserts and they were very good
the menu was huge so i will definitely be coming to try some more dishes
best indian in las_vegas
me and my fiancee finally got a chance to come here
we ordered one of the dinner for
can't remember_the_name of it
but its a sampler
all of them were awesome
i cannot wait_to_go_back
as a person who grew_up eating curry a few times a week
i have high expectations when it comes to curries or any type of indian food for that matter
this is one of my favorite indian_restaurants in las_vegas
your best value for eating here is to eat during the buffet lunch hours
you have the opportunity to sample a variety of the top_notch dishes and always go back for seconds
or thirds
the dinner is good
too
but your bill can add up quickly once you order an appetizer
two entrees
and naan
well i would have given it stars except that the service was lousy i was there by myself and felt invisible
they were very nice when they did show up
had to ask twice to get a beer
it wasn't that busy come on now
what really pissed me off was the brown_rice scam
i was told my meal came with white race and i asked for brown and was charged extra
you gotta be f ing kidding me
i expect to get reamed on the strip but here
all that said it is a really nice place
very attractive
tasty food and best beer_selection i have every since in an indian restaurant including some indian beers i had never seen before and the one i ordered was quite good
if they can up their game on service and stop selling brown_rice at gunpoint i would have been much happier
dinner for two
first one listed on the menu
was absolutely_delicious
will definitely put this place on our regular rotation of restaurants
price is very fair and atmosphere is pleasant
great lunch time buffet
good service
great naan
and good food
junk
i'm very disappointed in yelp_reviews on this one
the flavors were not that great
nan_bread did not come out until we were finished with our lunch
i will not be back
there is another place here in lv that blows this place away
i am typically not a huge_fan_of indian food
but this place has changed my mind
the decor is very modern and the restaurant does not have that usual smell that comes with indian_cuisine
the meal is buffet style
and although i was not certain what the items i was putting on my plate were they all tasted yummy
i especially loved the garlic_naan bread with the sauces they provided
so good
i wish this place wasn't so far away
they make me want to be vegetarian
they do have chicken and goat
which are delicious
but the vegetarian food is like no other
they serve fresh bread
i usually go for the garlic butter naan
for the drinks
i like the mango_lassi because it thick and not overly sweet
the decor is very special and feels warm
it's a very simple restaurant
but i love it
the waiters are quick to clean up finished plates
i've only had the buffet here
which is about
very low price for delicious food
in the buffet
each item is labelled with a lot of details
so you know exactly what you are eating
lunch buffet
quit reading this review and go get you some
the food was so good
meats were cooked well
not just chewy mystery meat in sauce
everything was flavorful
it was a very casual environment
and it wasn't touristy
the food and service here are so good
everything is done with care
and probably love
every dish reflects the interest in maintaining high_quality
that is
the chefs don't seem bored
even with the typical standby items you find on the menu of an indian restaurant
and speaking of the menu
the names and descriptions of each dish are as delightful to read as the food itself is to consume
the mighty momos were a highlight
but i would order the vertical vindaloo and mango masala dish again as well
i tried to give it
hearts
but evidently yelp doesn't accept any special characters
unfortunately
after living here a year i've discovered that my beloved new city is sorely lacking in indian food
perhaps i was spoiled by having the delights of devon so close by
but i really came to take quality indian_restaurants for granted
we've been coming here since we were tourists and this place was known simply as
himalayan cuisine
with nepalse plates and much more rustic decor
nowadays
the redone and renamed mint is more of an indo_chinese fusion sort of place
but they have that one hallmark that every self respecting indian restaurant needs a lunch buffet
it has a good selection compared to some of the other indian_lunch_buffets in town and is a really good deal at
the ala_carte dinner menu is very comprehensive and has lots of options and tweaks available to the courses
but we pretty much exclusively come for lunch when the value is best
the service has traditionally been awful and inattentive but has gotten much better lately
with that marked improvement this is clearly our top choice for indian food in the valley
i had a buy one get one entree coupon to this restaurant
so i decided to stop by because i really like indian food
it was buffet time there
and most restaurants don't honor the bogo entree coupons for buffet
so i was thinking it might not go as planned
but the waiter said i could use it
great deal
the other bonus about this place besides how good the food tastes
is that it offers gluten_free food actually labeled
gluten_free
i have celiac disease so that meant a lot to me
thanks mint_indian_bistro
i like you guys
i've found over the years
that trying an indian restaurant during their_lunch_buffet is by far the best value
and a great way to try_new_things without being disappointed if you don't really like it
i love chicken_tikka_masala
unfortunately mint's didn't really tickle my fancy as much as i was hoping it would
it was good
but not as flavorful as i'm used to
that being said
they had other dishes that were delish
i liked their chili_chicken
and chicken_vindaloo
their garlic_naan was fluffy and yummy
and both rice dishes were good
give this place a try
fantastic food
great service
friends love their mango_lassi
which is a yogurt drink
tried this place for the first time tonight
loved the food and the service was great
can't_wait_to_come_back and try different stuff
my husband and i went here on a wednesday evening around p
m
the restaurant was fairly busy with both dine in customers and a to go line
they also seemed understaffed
and worst of all
the waiters use ipads to take your order
which seemed to be more of a burden for them than a time saver
our waiter seemed like he cared but was overwhelmed
some other members of the staff
however
seemed the opposite
part of the reason we tried this indian restaurant was because it has a full bar
unfortunately
simple mixed drinks took between minutes to arrive at our table
i would not recommend ordering any of the more elaborate drinks on the menu because the wait time would probably be even longer
we ordered naan
an appetizer
and two entrees
they brought out the naan first
then minutes_later
only one entree
then we waited about ten_minutes for the second entree
thankfully
we were sharing both things
or this would've been way awkward
at this point
we still hadn't received our appetizer
so we asked the waiter to please cancel it
the food was actually quite great
we ordered the chef's special lamb kabob and the vertical vindaloo with chicken thigh
and they were both excellent
the vindaloo was not saucy enough for my liking
and the
full
size was rather small for the price
other than that
we weren't disappointed by the actual food
despite its strange delivery times
we are easy on salt
the worst thing ever heardfrom a restaurant manager when complained that the food had no salt in it
i know it's a star rated restaurant but its been more favored for family friends than new customers
don't ever go during rush hours
they say they have indo_chinese fusion food
don't order any chinese dish as it has no salt in it and the restaurant manner instead of apologizing say that they are easy on salt
i will never ever go back to this restaurant
this is my personal experience
must go
while in vegas
being from the bay_area
i have indian pakistani restaurants by the dozens everywhere
so
when we looked up for indian food in the vegas area
i wasn't having high expectations
i was surprised by what i had there
it was freaking amazing
and the cherry on the cake
it was zabihah halal
we had the following
chicken fried_rice
absolutely awesome
the rice had a slight crunchy texture and though by concept may sound like raw
but was actually superb
yellow dal
the best dal i have had in the us
period
low in spices and full of flavor
in love with dal now
malai_kofta
didn't care much for the kofta
but the gravy was awesome
chicken kadhai
wasn't bad but we had far superior food on our table
chicken momos
the momos were amazing but the sauce with it wasn't
i have had a lot of momos in india
my fav roadfood snack after chaat
i used to love the chilli sauce served with the momos in india
here the momos were pretty close to the original though
paneer pakoda
good
liked the sprinkling of chaat powder over it
chilli chicken
was nice
not like india
but am not complaining
the portion_sizes could be upped a notch
the half portions are way too small and the full aren't that large themselves
the decor is nice
not date_night but better than indian restaurant standards
the service was really good
except their biryani nothing is really worth trying
i had planned on visiting this restaurant during our visit to lv christmas
took the bus off the strip to the atomic research museum across_the_street from the mint_indian_bistro
after the museum
we walked across to the restaurant and joined the line for the sunday lunch buffet
we added our name to the list
which was on a tablet
ipad perhaps
with the help of another customer
this was a new experience for me
the restaurant is only so big and we must of hit a popular time
polite host and waiters
waiter was great
especially for a buffet
we were a bit out of place
as we are not indian
but i saw that as a good sign as we waited
it must be really good indian food
it was great
my wife thought it was too hot
but she likes very mild
the flavors were wonderful
i've been to indian_buffets before
but this was more extensive
this will be a repeat should we return to lv
good tasty food
spices are added appropriately for the dishes
must eat place if visiting_vegas
went here for dinner yesterday
the place was packed for a monday night but they arranged a table for us after a minute wait
the server quickly brought out some papads and chutneys coriander and tamarind
the chutneys tasted great
i remember visiting a long time ago for the buffet and not being very excited about the food
this trip was different
we all were excited_to_see so many options of different_types_of indian food
and tried the following
chau_chau noodles with veggies this was yummy despite the taste of tomato ketchup in it
really yummy actually
schezwan fried_rice good
dal_makhani yumm
saag with paneer flavorful
cheese_naan
naan and tandoori roti were fresh and crisp
the only downside was the fact that the portion_sizes are quite small for the price
they also charge for chutney
onions etc
i look_forward to going back and trying some other stuff like south_indian food and indian street_food
which i always seem to crave
the difference between their gulab_jamun and heroin is that one is a hopelessly addictive substance
known for its ability to wreck one's health and soul
as one lies
cheats
steals
and even kills just to lay hands on a little more
to get that blissful feeling
and the other is an illicit narcotic
everything else on the lunch buffet was pretty good
too
but
when i'm lbs and diabetic
it'll be mint's gulab_jamun to blame
this little gem is nestled not far off the strip and boasts one of vegas' most extensive indian style menus
there must be over
different combinations of how you could experience their food so that's one of the main reasons i keep_coming_back
well
that
and the beer_selection
you'd be hard pressed to find a more eclectic selection anywhere_else
norse
belgian
indian and much more adorn the beer_list
but prepare to be occasionally disappointed since they will run out of their more esotheric brews
but i digress
getting back to the food
huge portions
with the option of half portions
score
multiple vegetarian vegan_options
had the kofta tonight
and delicious naan roti make this a must stop for me whenever i'm in vegas
try the tikka
biryani or any of the curries and you won't be sorry
simple review for this place
lunch buffet that is awesome
great quality food with a decent variety
they also offer off if you show your unlv student id
lack of th star because if you order any drink that is not water it takes them a long time to bring it
but the decor is nice and the staff is friendly and the food is good
great place to get your indian fix in
oh and if your into the whole vegan thing they have a lot of options for that on their menu
simply amazing
no words to describe how incredible the food is
tikka masala is to die for
the service was great
too
they were all very friendly and overall it was a great experience
believe the reviews hype
in the words of nike
just do it
i'm definitely doing it again that's for sure
fresh
delicious
indian food for the lunch buffet
worth_the_wait
as you're seated they bring you fresh made naan of your choice
buffet line has vegetarian entrees along with chicken and goat
mmmm mmmm good
yummy indian food
our first time here
we came for the lunch buffet
which was a great deal at around
there was a lot of variety here
almost too much
as it was hard to tell the differences by a non seasoned indian food expert like me but everything was fresh and good
except the tandoori being a little overcooked
here is a pic of my plate
http

userid ezzyujdouig p gyb pv a hnflw fvu avvij a
there were some really good dishes
but i really enjoyed the chicken and mild curry goodies
also
the garlic_naan bread was super yummy
i also liked the more spicy chicken dish
which had peppers and other tidbits
they have plenty of orange slices for my little one
which makes him a very happy boy
come check it for a great and inexpensive indian food buffet
the lunch buffet can't be beat here
the price is super cheap and the food is very good
is it worth the hour long wait one time
when the line was out the door and had to wait a super long time for a lunch at pm on a thursday
ehh
the buzz must have gotten out cause this place was packed for lunch
the garlic_naan is super fresh and keeps coming out when asked for
the selections at the buffet are all tasty and good
my go to indian food is always chicken_tikka
tandori
rice and goat_curry which are all good here
the tandori is not too dry
which happens often for indian_buffets i noticed
and the goat_curry has lots of actual goat meat
spicy factor is definitely there so be warned
i also ordered a mango_lassi but that was ok
i think it was a pre made from a carton though
boo
which is a little disappointing
the only issue is when it's packed
the service gets a little slower and the wait is pretty long since people do not want to leave without getting more than their money's worth
you know a place is super good when it's native people are taking over the place
not trying to be racist but this place was full of indians and their huge families
so it must be good right
don't miss out on this place and lunch is very good cheap eats for great food
i liked the simple decor and that this place had an amazing menu with entrees from all over india as some of my favorite dishes are south_india
sadly they were busy and understaffed and caused my friend and i to almost miss our flight
we spent over hours here
when we first arrived there was only one other party within an_hour the place was packed
lucky restaurant apparently bad for us
things we dined on
garlic_naan
a little too crispy for dipping in my entree broth but still good
veggie kofta
lacking flavor although the kofta had the right texture
plain dosa
massive in size check out my photos
dosa tasted great but the coconut_chutney was probably the worst i've tasted
saag_paneer
lacking more flavor then the kofta
do they not season the food at all
lime soda
suppose to be fresh squeezed limes
you could clearly taste that it was not
rose lassi
never tried a rose lassi before although i love mango and mint lassi's and i love rose ice_cream and yogurt
not what i was expecting
service was terrible took minutes to get us our drinks alone then our order was taken add another mins
no i am not kidding
i remember this like yesterday although it was almost weeks_ago
this was a very stressful dining_experience for my friend and i
a not so pleasant way for us to spend our last few hours in vegas
i will_not_be_returning when back in vegas
this is the best place in vegas
we love the food
the staff
and the lunch buffet
we eat the lunch buffet on a regular_basis and love getting to enjoy a good meal and talk with the staff
we go all the time
curry addicts
great options for all kind of diets and special needs
vegan
vegetarian
meat lovers
etc
safe to pass
i gave it stars for their off the menu food
its pricey and the quantity is bit low
their buffet is the best indian buffet i've ever had
there are so many varieties of veg and non_veg curries
two different_types_of naans
rice
different indo_chinese dishes
food tests excellent and its only plus tax per_person
there buffet is from am pm daily
they get bit busy over the weekend so there might be minute wait
this place is good every time we go
this time we got there right at as they were opening the buffet
all the dishes were out
hot and delicious
the staff is friendly and courteous
i make it a point to bring out of towners here
delicious
authentic_indian_food
i love to eat
no surprises there
but what i really love is a cuisine specific buffet
i'm fond of smorgasbord buffets too
but there's something about just indian food or just chinese_food or just mexican food
and endless amounts of it
that make my heart go pitter patter
in an excitement way and a high blood pressure and cholesterol way
so when in a panic of needing indian food and needing it now
i met my girl jaime w for some ayce yums
when we arrived
we were given menus
wtf for
i thought
it turns_out that in addition to their delicious lunch buffet
they have a hefty selection of drinks
alcoholic and non
next time
i started off wrong by getting a small plate instead of the bigass one necessary for all indian food pursuits
it didn't take me long to fill it up
i did not care for the green salad too peppery but hey
that's the beauty of the buffet
chutneys all were so winning
especially combined with any of the other various items on the buffet
you can't_go_wrong with mango_chutney and paneer_tikka_masala
amirite
the menu is supermenu
so clearly marked for anybody with dietary restrictions
my only dietary restriction is having only one stomach so i'm not concerned about vegetarian_vegan gluten_free but if that's your bag
here's your place
i also like how there are menu suggestions and they let you know that some things are desserts
except those little donuts
those are marked wrong
they are for every course
definitely will come back for the dinner menu and for the buffet again
can't complain_about a thing
service
awesome
food
massive
ambiance was great
my first time here and ill be back
leftovers were super good at the crib
i grinded it up the next day
my first time here and it was absolutely_amazing
surprisingly superb beer_selection
our server was very helpful
made great suggestions and was genuinely kind
great place
mint is really good
i am not overly familiar with indian_cuisine so i can't give great insight but what we ate was delicious and i had to be rolled out on a cart by my wife afterword
they have a really delicious buffet
if you have any special dietary restrictions
this is the place to go
they mark each buffet item as vegan vegetarian gluten_free more
i really appreciate that
mint is located a few blocks from the strip and practically across from the university
this attracts both visitors and local students to their restaurant
the lunch buffet is what i usually go here for
with the unlv discount
it is an affordable and tasty option
during the daytime
the interior looks bright and airy
at night it has a moody romantic atmosphere
the servers are always friendly and i'm_so_glad they are very accommodating for people with food allergies
the menu is clearly labeled with icons indicating veg gf nuts etc
onto the food
goat_curry and any paneer dish are the things i make a beeline for
the goat is tender and full of flavor every time i come here
for dinner
i usually get takeout on my way home
i've tried the rebel curry
saag
rogan_josh
and a few others
there's lots to try here
dinner or lunch
mint does not disappoint
finishing the last episode of gordon ramsey's great escape
i had the strongest urge for some flavor packing curries and was instructed to come here by my over zealous vegan friend
this restaurant has such a wide_variety of curries of non vegan and vegan selections
their buffet runs from am pm and might i say
something everyone should become very familiar with
the buffet is only and it comes with such a variety of foods
it's such a steal
considering i came here for dinner and ordered chicken_tikka_masala
buttered chicken
and naan
the bill came out to about
the buffet includes chicken vegetable tikka masala
tandoori_chicken
basmati_rice
bone in lamb_curry and more dishes i can't pronounce
it includes normal and garlic_naan
the curry is packed with so much flavor
the naan comes out freshly_made
hot
the meat of the tandoori and chicken_tikka_masala is slightly dry but other than that i really can't complain
food is an a for me
the only complaint i have is for dinner
their portions are a bit small for what you pay for but nonetheless still very tasty
service is spot on and punctual whenever you're out of drink
naan or if you have empty plates
oh_yeah their naan is refillable
our server was extremely friendly
wasn't overbearing and took care of us throughout the whole dinner
ambiance was very warm
lights dim but not dungeness and with trending indian songs to add culture to a very modern looking restaurant
despite having a few indian_restaurants surrounding this area
i'll always return to mint for their money worthy buffet
vegan_options
affable and attentive service and their delicious food
in looking at the reviews on mint
i had my expectations set very high when walking into this small resturant
they were quite busy when we arrived after pm on a saturday_night
but the wait wasn't too long
though there wasn't a place to sit_down inside
it was a cold night in vegas
you'll see that i frequent indian_restaurants fairly regularly wherever i travel
so i know what i like and how it compares to other establishments
my family and i decided to go with the chef's northern india tasting menu and were given a plethora of different dishes
though with smaller than normal portions
we all enjoyed the pakora
they called them pakodas
and again thought we were in for the best indian meal in a long time
that being said
the lamb_vindaloo was rather skimpy on the lamb
and it was tougher than it should have been
the chicken_tikka_masala had great flavor
but was more masala than chicken
and the daal was good
but just a tad undercooked
i was also disappointed when i asked for a
spicy
i received something more like a or
they do have something they call inferno chili sauce
but i thought my dishes came from a very universal pot that's geared to less spice
and flavor
as other reviewers have noted
their naan_bread is excellent
service was satisfactory
but i never felt_like i was being
served
meaning it was more obligatory than driven
all in all
a good indian meal
though i have had better for less money
this was my first indian_restaurant_in_vegas
went with a friend and it was great
i'm looking_forward to going back and maybe try the inferno menu
i'll sign the waiver
everything we had was darn good
i can not remember the actual name of the dish i had but it had mango and chicken but it was super
my friend had a veggie dish based off of a butter_chicken curry
and he said his too was good
i've been telling my friends all about it
mint is my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in the valley
i love coming here not only because it's near unlv
but because it's really good
you_can't_beat
tax for a delicious lunch buffet with off if you're a unlv student
it just doesn't happen
their butter naan is so yummy
i have to remember not to fill up on that so i can fit more delicious food in me
my ocdness likes that they organize their buffet trays from starters to sides to entrees
they used to have a dessert warmer at the very end
but i think they nixed this because not enough people were utilizing it during the lunch hours
my favorites are
and i will definitely butcher the correct names of these items
the yellow indian fried_rice with vegetables
fried vegetables
the noodles with vegetables
chicken_tikka_masala
i know that one
goat_curry
and spicy chili_chicken
i'm pretty sure i've tried everything there
but these are my go to dishes
the stars comes from food and price alone
they really do have delicious high_quality food
the service is consistently mediocre if not subpar
but if i'm at mint it's for the food
also
it takes awhile for drinks to come out
especially if you order coffee
i don't know if it's a cultural thing
but i've almost always received my coffee at the end of my meal
i would prefer it as an accompaniment to my meal
and getting your bill can take awhile too sometimes
if i have to leave
i just go up to the counter and pay
and fair warning
you will leave the restaurant full and with a lingering fragrance on your clothing and hair for the rest of the day
you were warned
one star
and there's good reason for it
visited mint today
i love indian food
i grew_up on middle eastern
pakistani
and indian food
the food here is not indian
it's indian made for american taste_buds
yaddaddaimean
but let's get down to the critique
service
there hasn't been a single time that i have come here
in which i have felt comfortable walking through the door
it's always a depressed emotionally challenged man who takes us to our seat
water
at first
is there quickly
refills are scarce to none
we wait minutes for the check every time
never half a smile cracked by the server
s
and everyone who works here looks
plain
miserable
food
i'm a huge curry fan
and a huge goat fan
both of these are garbage
here
and this is why
all curry tastes the same
jus different levels of spicyness
the goat is terribly undercooked
chewy
and has no flavor
as everything else
here
is flavor less
today was the last straw
there was hair in my food
done
i don't pay money for hair
after the fact
ive been feeling like crap all day
stomach is not right
i am unbelievably
and strangely fatigued
i regret this
there's nothing here for me
i don't trust this place's discipline in cleanliness at all
i don't trust that it
matters
to them until they get caught and shut down
which they already have
as far as i've heard
for sanitation
they're here for the quick buck
it seems that there's no
moral standard
in this business
we were visiting las_vegas and were craving_indian_food
mint had a lot of good reviews and we decided to check_this_place_out
the crowd was extremely young and the place was lively
the decor was okay with muted sounds of indian cinema music in the background
the menu was very innovative almost every appetizer and entree had a twist
we are vegetarian and so this review won't help if_you_are_looking to hear about the chicken_tikka_masala
which i am told is good
so
we ordered the organic samosa and vegetable_pakoras
we also ordered the mahakali mango masala
yes that is the real name
dal maharani balti
and the hariyali kabab
after a long day of gallivanting
we were hungry and would have eaten anything cooked
for the food then
while the names were innovative
the food not so much
the hariyali kabab was green
as expected
but was bland
the chutneys were basted on a bit too much and there was literally no spice
the mahakali mango masala was similarly taste free and bland
we had ordered this with paneer and it was undercooked
the dal wasn't bad and probably the only item that was tasty enough
the breads
on_the_other_hand
were fresh and nice
also there were a lot of innovative lassi types
these were very nice as well
perhaps the items with meat were better and the crowd was generally having a lot of fun
so
we might have been the unlucky group
this place is definitely worth a visit just to see the creativity in the menu
clean restaurant
i ate the maharajah tikka_marsala with paneer cheese
really creamy and very delicious
i wanted it to be spicy so i asked for a
but it wasn't spicy at all
my friend ordered the vindaloo with spicy level at and it was quite spicy
not really consistent with their spice_levels
im guessing if you are ordering something creamy and you want it spicy
at least go with an
naan was soft and good
i enjoyed it overall
i had the privilege of enjoying the lunch buffet
fittingly dubbed
nirvana
buffet by the staff
i tried almost everything offered with the buffet and loved each item
i will be back
medium spicy turned_out_to_be the most bland indian food ever at least for an indian palate
surprising good for an inexpensive lunch buffet
was
before taxes and tips
food choice was limited but tasty
they cook your bread to order
included
and my buttered naan was appropriately fresh
hot
a soft and tasty
soup
salads
entrees and dessert were all quite good and it's no surprise i guess that a good part of the crowds were indians
i ordered a masala chai
supplement
that was also very nice
this review is for the buffet only
unbelievable
everything is high_quality and consistently amazing
stylish d_cor
fantastic friendly service
all the entrees are labeled so vegans and vegetarians know what's up
i'm addicted to this place best indian_buffet_in_town
i wish they would open up one on_the_west_side
it would be packed
when i first moved to vegas i was skeptical about finding as good of a himalayan indian restaurant as i had back home
then i found the mint_indian_bistro
it was delicious
the food is hearty and flavorful while the wait_staff is kind and giving
the atmosphere was cozy
i felt_like i could eat
curl up and go to sleep
i will keep_coming_back to this restaurant
don't change
a new favorite
mint delivered with a great beer_list
extensive_menu and delicious food
this is another almost hidden_gem and feels worlds away from the overpriced hotel restaurants
our group of four loved the samosa
saag_paneer
butter_chicken and shrimp_curry
the menu is very diverse and next time i will be more adventurous
the buttered garlic_naan was awesome
i took my father here for a buffet lunch
it was his first time ever eating indian
the atmosphere is quiet and clean
to be honest
i felt_like this buffet equally represented cuisines from all over the continent of india
i preferred the vegetarian_dishes and rather enjoyed them and my father took a special liking to their goat_curry
their goat is very tender and has a light gamy flavor but was seasoned well
the vegetable_korma and pav bhaji were excellent
i would highly_recommend this place if you wan't great indian at prices half of what you would expect_to_pay at tamba on the strip
we went for a sit_down dinner
and i was completely satisfied with my experience
ordered the malai_kofta and the chicken_tikka_masala which both tasted very good
the naan was also very good
maybe a little fluffier in shape as opposed to flat like i am used to
but delicious
this is the best indian food i have had in town so far
also
the interior of the place is beatiful
lit romantically and well decorated
i will go back for the lunch buffet next time
the service was good and we did not have to wait long to get our food
dinner portions might be small to some people
i thought it was plenty of food though
met up with a friend for lunch
its been a while since ive been here but the buffet is still really good
or
i dont remember
they had mint_chutney
very good stuff
not spicy though
they had an interesting basmati_rice with cashews
dried cranberries
and other stuff
it was pretty good
never had anything like that before
all of their curries were excellent
i really liked the mutton on bone the most
the tandoori_chicken was a little dry
but it usually is
lunch had just started so everything was fresh
last time i ate here i dunno if i ate too much but i had really bad food coma
this time i had plates but feel good
maybe its the waiters thick indian accent that makes the food taste better at mint
but this place is definitely one of the better places to get inidian food in town

my husband i were craving_indian_food and we decided to try out this spot
we ate at the ayce for lunch and it was ok
the food tasted like it had been sitting out for a while
but we were there at
pm
i felt_like most other_indian_places have more of a variety for their ayce than this one
like i said
the food was ok
but there are other restaurants_in_vegas that are much better
my recent discovery and my recent all time favorite indian lunch buffet for only
this place is a bit small
you have to come early or wait in line
during summer months they have patio dining that relieves over crowding
the value and the quality of food is excellent
you even get a choice of naan
there are a varieties of vegetarian_dishes
and a handful of meat dishes including lamb or goat and of course the usual chicken curries and chicken tandorii
dessert is also included
mint is my go to place for indian food in town
the food is great and the menu is massive
and it notes healthy
vegetarian
and vegan_options as well
they also have a long menu for drinks
both alcoholic and not
the restaurant can get fairly busy
so calling ahead for a reservation or a wait time is a good idea
try the pistachio kulfi
or four
for dessert
lots of organic
gluten_free
and or vegan_options with food and drink
very good service
nice_atmosphere and decent location and prices
went for a late lunch
definitely reccommended
but don't do what my friend did and eat stuff off of their inferno challenges where you eat ghost pepper and habeneros infused food in order to get on their wall of fame
it ruined his whole night
food was great and love how easy the menu is for vegetarian vegans amazing
love the gluten_free designations on the lunch buffet
pleasant
friendly and competent service
too
highly_recommended as a close to unlv and dri lunch location
and it appears widely approved of by the indian community in town
too
but be warned
it's tiny
and most tables are booths
so if you're a top
you're taking up too many seats
if you're
you're still a table hog
best for groups of and
beware
bread they offer is not free
we got tricked into that so dont make the same mistake
service
stars
food
stars
best indian food we've had
aahran curry was amazing
get it with lamb
its so tender
anyways i would have given the place a star other than the fact that the guy tricked us into paying for the bread we didn't eat
made it sound like it came with the meal
we came here for lunch last saturday and as the place was packed we had to wait for minutes to get seated
the host tried to push us into sitting outside but most in our group refused and preferred to wait_for_a_table to come up
food wise there were standard items that you will find in any other buffet
the taste was very average with surprisingly no dish really standing out
the only worthwhile comment was that the noodles were really indian style chow mein that is very common in and around delhi
they gave_us hot bread
naan
at the table without charging more for it
i'm not sure if that is their policy or they just forgot to do that
the sweet dish
gulab_jamun
looked pretty nice but when eaten felt_like they were recycled after being left around for a couple_of_weeks so you can avoid that
the menu on their_website mentions lots of options for the sweet dish but the only other item was an empty bowl of mango_custard
service overall was a little slow considering the amount of rush that was there
and the host
could be the owner not sure
at the door tried to be friendly but ended_up being very pushy
overall left satisfied but not overly enthused to return again
definitely over priced for the quality of the food
people almost only ordered a couple of appetizers and curry dishes
strip_mall ambience and scarce service during lunch but the food was a huge step up from my low buffet expectations
solid spread of indian favorites with high_quality ingredients
as a chicken snob who eschews chicken lips
ankles
and other ambiguous poultry parts
i was delighted to enjoy tasty chicken_breast in their dishes
the chicken tandoori
traditionally had a mix
contrary to an earlier post
our naan was noted on the bill but we not charged
we left both full and satisfied
recommended
by_far_the_best_indian buffett in us
hoping to find something similar in boston
like a topless dancer joggling three flaming chainsaws while doing your taxes
this place is awesome
although it is located in a strip_mall
don't let the meek locale deter you from this trying out this delicious indian gem
i went here with my fiancee for lunch as we both were craving indian and heard it had a buffet going on
her being a picky eater and me on a see food diet
i see food
i eat it
i thought a buffet would satisfy both our needs
although the choice on the buffet might not be as extensive as some casino lines
what they had to offer were all amazing
a case of quality over quantity
you can't_go_wrong with any dishes
i have tried curries from the east coast and west coast and even in india
this place can easily compete with some of the best curries i've had
try the paneer curry
so good
it is cheese btw
the wait_staff were polite and quick with a fresh basket of garlic or non garlic_naan so you can happily wipe your plate clean
their fruit lassis are suspected
probably made with flavoring liquor
we came back here a few days for dinner as we couldn't handle cold turkey from this place
definitely have dinner here
no buffet during dinner unfortunately but food and service is even better
i absolutely love this restaurant
they offer so many different healthy choices like vegan and gluten_free foods
their buffet is the best deal ever
because you try different delicious healthy foods at a very very good price
the customer_service is wow
i feel so welcome every time i go there
the restaurant is very clean and cute and all the employees are so nice and genuinely friendly
their bread is the best i've had
delicious flavorful food and awesome customer_service
i also tried a a mango_lassi for the first time and it was so yummy
definitely will be back here again
as usual everything was delicious
we get the watermelon mintini
chicken_tika_masala
palak_paneer
lamb_vindaloo
vegatable raita
and the bhatura
sp
whatever we don't finish we bring home and it tastes even better the next day
i wonder how these people are making money
probably because their customer base is not indian
thus no one knows how real indian food tastes
the papri chat was insipid
one could only taste yogurt
no seasoning
in fact the papri smelled
old
the entree
malai_kofta was overwhelmingly sweet
the koftas barely had any paneer or what is known as cottage_cheese
which it is supposed to have
the
rotis
or flatbread were burnt
we could barely bite into it
rather we had to pull it apart
these people don't seem to care their customers either
we kept waiting for someone to come and take our order
we were very disappointed with their food and service
the only thing that was good was the papad served at the very beginning
these people seriously need to taste their own food and then change their cook
doesn't seem like the owners know the taste of the food that comes put of their restaurant's kitchen
i am going for only because i need to rate them
i've only gone for the lunch buffet
every time we've gone
it has been ridiculously crowded
the restaurant is small
and the tables and chairs are so close together
the food is good
but i prefer other buffets
someday i will try their dinner menu to compare
i love lal mohan
i love lal mohan
i would start and finish with those during lunch buffet
so gooooooood
for dinner you have to prix fixe it for sure so you can get everything
and if you like spicy ask for so of there inferno spice on the side
if you can stand heat like me you can get a gift card by eating their inferno curry about oz
i would do it but i don't want to rob them
i like them too much
finally
indian food at its most complex and satisfying
and good value
fun vibe
good service
normally i hate buffets
but i am going to eat here regularly
they are constantly bringing out fresh food so the food hasn't been sitting there long
it was very tasty and the price was very fair
i am a local
but my european friends showed me this little gem
as vegas tourists for ten years they seem to have found all the best places
the restaurant has a wonderful ambiance
and great service
we had the vegetarian gluten_free prix fixe
delish
what a shocking surprise this place was
a wonderful treat
we were visiting the museum across_the_street
got hungry
and thought we would just walk to the strip_mall across the way and grab some lunch there
we couldn't even see this place at first
but once we hit the parking_lot
we noticed the sign and decided to go in
we were there for lunch
which
as others have noted
is a buffet
and
as someone who eats and cooks a lot of indian food
i have to say the buffet was super generous in terms of options and quality
they even had a bin of full sized idli
which you never seldom get on the buffet line
food was much better than average
the naan was excellent
and
the selections were original and refreshing
the service seems meek almost like the waitstaff is afraid to talk to you
and
the table service needed to complement the buffet is a bit slow
of the two things we needed from the waitstaff
the staff got both items wrong
no biggee
but still noteworthy
we did have a table of some foul mouthed young men near us who were talking disrespectfully of women
i might have liked it if management had taken_care_of that for us
but
eventually they did leave
outstanding lunch buffet
one of the best in the city
great selection
always clean and immediate seating
great food
this place is amazing
tasty
affordable
which is rare for vegas
cool decor
and excellent customer_service
coming from san_francisco where there is many top_notch indian_restaurants this place definitely meets those standards
they have a really nice lunch buffet from
pm
great naan and excellent service
definitely the place when i'm in town
great work
everything about this place is on point
every time i come here
either with my fiance or friends
i feel like i am treated like royalty without it being overbearing
staff_is_very_friendly
interactive
and professional
food is incredible
i always get a different dish to try since everything tastes like an explosion of flavor in_your_mouth
garlic_naan
get with butter
well worth it
is a must
delicious
could eat this for my meal
also
a nice little plus for you spicy food eaters out there when you first open your menu
there is an entire page dedicated to
inferno
courses
i don't know if you have ever had a ghost chili or not
but these meals consist of that and habeneros
on a scale of in spicy
most of them are s
there is an inferno curry that gets you a fifty dollar gift card and a picture on the wall if you successfully eat the entire meal
after you sign a waiver of course
i haven't had the pleasure
but the inferno kabobs had my mouth pleasantly on fire
love_this_place
delicious food
nice environment
friendly_staff
just a little pricey then most indian food
delicious food
nice environment
friendly_staff
just a little pricey then most indian food
very busy
make reservations
this was our second trip to the bistro for their gluten_free menu
service and prices were good
it was a little more spicy this time and we said we wanted it at a to with a being the hottest
would hate to see what a would be
i know this is subjective
but just be prepared
also
the bistro was filled with indians with only one other caucasian couple i think that is huge compliment to how good and authentic the food is
i highly suggest the bistro
wow
this place is awesome
went here with a friend and had the tasting pre fix dinner we couldnt even finish it
and for bucks not bad at all
came with appetizer and desert
cant beat it
best indian restaurant in the las_vegas
we were on vacation and did not knew where to eat ready review online and went there we were their everyday while we were in las_vegas all i have to say is star restaurant also the owner came to our table and made sure everything was ok
thank you guys for good food away from home
nice location
nice decor
very modern and straight
and amazing food
we had the indian dinner for which was enough for the three of us
attentative service
never had to run on empty
authentic indian and nepalese food
relaxed atmosphere
friendly and good humored staff a complete delight
stopped in last friday for the lunch buffet
i'm not very familiar_with_indian_food though i've always wanted to try it and this place had a good yelp rating so that's how we ended_up there
the food was very good
once i determined what everything was and tried several small portions
the servers were quick to refill our water
we had a large_party
and the restaurant seemed very clean
not sure where to start with this place
here are some things to note
the wait situation was way out of hand when we got there
we got an empty promise of mins when we actually waited mins
the manager was rude
service overall was bland like the food
i would give my money to india_palace any day
that place is the real deal
mint was delicious
the service_was_prompt and attentive
the mango_lassis were thick and tasty
the neighborhood around the strip_mall is a little rough
we had to run the beggar gauntlet on our way in
but once you're inside it is one of the nicest indian_restaurants we've been too
do not miss the chance to get away from the casinos for a real meal
if you enjoy indian food you_will_not_be_disappointed
this place has the best food that i have tasted in a long time
i love spices and the combinations are the best from let's me decide depending_on my taste_buds
my fav on the menu is the andhra curry with shrimp
every time i visit vegas
this is one of my stops before returning home
i've just turned vegan and i am still figuring out what to eat
a friend and i split the vegan prix fixe dinner
it was just wonderful
i never knew eating vegan could be this good
i look_forward to my next visit to las_vegas
i will definitely come back to mint_indian_bistro
this place is the best indian food i've had in all of vegas
except it being super cold in there
everything else was perfect
they actually make the food spicy here
we ordered samosas as an app
the tamarind_chutney was the best i've ever had
for dinner
i got the chicken_tikka_masala at level hot
and the hubbs got a veggie khorma at a level
also supper hot
the raita
yogurt
was a smaller order than i would've liked but it was really good
was looking for a lunch place near the national atomic testing museum and up popped mint on yelp
good choice
the lunch buffet at was more than we are used to paying but there were more and more varied selections
everything was good but be warned
a lot of things were hot
even the saag was hotter than the chicken_vindaloo
they have a large selection of beers and wine
including organic choices
and lassi cocktails
the bill for buffets and glasses of loma larga chardonnay came to
i wouldn't make a special trip here if we return to las_vegas but i can recommend it if you are in the area and have a hankering for indian
parking is very limited
i would recommend car pooling if you are coming with a group
the inside is very quaint
they even have a cute little patio
i went during the lunch buffet and it was pretty good
i may be butchering the name of this because my phone autocorrected to andrea and now i can't remember what it was called
but the ankur
chicken curry was amazing
chicken literally melted in my mouth
the flavor was perfect
by far my favorite item
the chicken chili was also pretty good
pieces of chicken made with chopped up chunks of red and green bell peppers
reminded_me_of chicken jalfrezi
chicken_tikka_masala was a different color than i've normally seen
it was ok but i think i had a hard time getting past the way it looked
i just couldn't' eat it
i prefer mine to be more consistently creamy and a little darker in color
this one was almost the color of salmon
the chicken ttandoori was as good as i've ever had before
definitely worth it
i didn't see raita on the buffet line
i probably could have asked for it
but they were really busy and i didn't want to be a bother
i guess i was really thirsty because i finished my first glass_of_water quickly
instead of refilling it the server set a carafe of water on my table
now that i think of it
he never asked me what i wanted to drink
good thing i wanted water because that's what he brought me
the naan could_have_been_better
it seemed to be a little dry or hard
i don't think it was fresh
they were a lot of veggie vegan_options and the ones i tried were pretty good
potato
sag aloo and a few others
bathrooms are small
only one stall per sex
that was a pretty outstanding indian buffet
i'm not giving it a perfect five because it was a tad expensive and the quality of the chicken could've been better
the soups were superb
nice attentive service is well
garlic_naan was a good choice
nice flavor
one of the indian restro in vegas
authentic food
simply love its aaloo tikki chat
paneer_tikka and chhole
a bit higher on price as most of main_course dishes cost at least bucks
but trust_me its worth
quite near to the strip and airport as well
thats an added point
they also have inferno dished if anyone is looking for
in short if you want quick authentic_indian_food
this is the place
first indian good experience
came recommended
was very good at an affordable price
the food was really good
could be little bit better
the paneer_tikka_masala was less cooked
gulab jamoon was more chewy
my personal favorite was the chili_chicken
it was perfect
bad food
raw food
on top of that bad service
avoid this place unless you are so hungry that you can eat pretty much anything
it is difficult_to_find a place to satisfy my girlfriends and i since we have a vegan
a picky eater
and someone who has never tried other ethnic foods besides mexican and american
it was pretty pack considering it was late sunday evening
however
we were able to get a table right away and the food came out fast
they have a huge menu that is also vegan gluten_free friendly
i guess all indian food
the menu is well organized and laid_out with symbols next to each dish to help the diners that have diet restrictions
almost every dish can be made into vegan or vegetarian
they also have chicken
tofu
and cheese options
we ordered the onion cilantra paratha
organic veggie_samosas
mighty momos with veggie
chicken_tikka_masala
hot level it was not spicy
mixed chef's killer kabob
organic alo gobi masala
monterey jack cheese_naan and lastly mango and pistachio kulfi for deserts
not bad dish
everything was very good including their chutneys
i do wish they gave more rice since they only gave_us small bowls to share between people
they seemed to be reasonbly priced
our server
ronald was great and very helpful
the ambience of the place was nice
too
it was relaxing and calming
you know it's a good indian restraunt when it is packed with indian diners
overall
we are very happy and can't_wait_to_go_back
first time here
had samosas
vertical vindaloo with boneless lamb
cool raita a strawberry lassi
everything was delicious
hot
pleasantly spiced not too spicy
i could have had spicier but not necessary
i also had garlic_naan which wasn't crazy good buy delicious nonetheless
i want to come here for the lunch sometime when i'm free
it really is outstanding
what an amazing culinary experience
the flavors of the food are vibrant
the spicy noodle soup was amazing with each spoonful better than the last
it's a vegetarian delight
huge gluten_free menu
the food was really great
and it was cool that they had vegan_options
the service was ok
but they took forever to seat us even though the restaurant wasn't that crowded and there was only one party ahead of us
excellent indian food
had the tandoori_chicken and the saang with lamb
the chicken cooked_perfectly
the saang had big chunks of flavorful lamb
not overpoweringly gamey
the garlic_naan
awesome
they also have an extensive beer collection
its a small place and its pretty busy so i recommend making a reservation
we waited about minutes
but it was worth it
this is my go to spot for indian food in vegas
a
for the dosa
lassi's
and the service
on a separate occasion we took in laws
from india
for the lunch buffet
they said it was the best they've had in a long time
i would love to see them offer a chinese dosa or genie dosa
one of the best indian_restaurants
i have been to
hopefully they open one up in san jose
naan was fresh
vegetarian curries are well made and spiced to excellence
i want to give
for this restaurant
ambience is also very good
i would recommend it to my friends visiting las_vegas
i don't ever go out for indian food
seeing that i can just make it at home and most of the time restaurants just don't do indian food any justice
but mint is really true to the indian flavors
it's just like my grandmothers homemade food
really enjoy their_lunch_buffet
but lunch is always busy so be patient
i didn't give them stars bc the service isn't great
i had dinner with my
family there and the service was awful
the food is awesome
really what i expected
nice ambiance too
we ordered for different fried_rice
and all items were too good
best restaurant for indian food
tried veg dinner for option
its expensive but food was good
sampler has curries almost all are good
dal is average
overall food is good and service is good
oh mint how i love you
best service and best food
my husband and i have been going here since we first started dating and now our two kids even love it
forever a mint lover
finding mint_indian_bistro is like finding an oasis in the desert
where the oasis would be a really good indian restaurant and the desert
well
is las_vegas
my experiences are based_on dinner and not the lunch buffet
their staff is very accommodating here and are experienced in dealing with large families and groups with small children
on busy evenings
you can flag down any of their waitstaff for assistance
i've never made a reservation here and have not waited more than minutes during my last few visits
i love the extensive and almost daunting menu filled with northern and southern_indian dishes
we usually start off with some samosas and the bhel_puri
which is an indian snack food made of puffed rice
i always have to get garlic_naan with my meals
the naan is an indian flat_bread that's served hot out of the oven and has a wonderful texture
the bread is great for sopping up the sweet curry_sauce of their tikka masala
another dish to try is the smoky and aromatic lamb dish called rogan_josh
if you're adventurous
they have plenty of other delicious dishes to choose from and also serve vegetarian fare
we went there for dinner
we ordered idli
chana_masala
chicken curry and man
they were all bad
the food is expensive in general and for the food they serve
the prices are outrageous
i'm from arizona and i thought i knew good indian food until i went to mint
oh my goodness this place was so great
first walking in
the ambiance was quaint and comfortable
the servers were very friendly
i have a gluten_free vegan diet and i was surprised how many vegan and organic options they have on the menu
the food was incredible i couldn't believe it was vegan
definitely going to dine here again
great experience
really good food and very reasonable_prices
i'll be back
awesome food
andhra chicken and chicken chilly was very good
i desert mango_custard and gulab_jamun were good
they served hot naan
nana were soft and very good
i didnt tried anything in veg
but friends liked vegetarian too
fantastic indian food
i tried the minced chicken uttapam
really well made and fills you up pretty well
the ambience is fantastic and the service is courteous too
i think this is one of the greatest indian_restaurants in vegas
i end up eating here all three dinners while we were in vegas
this place has extensive_menu
most indian_restaurants i have been to
with extensive_menu items are not so great
once
we ordered lamb_chops
fried idli
biryani
chicken kadai
different_types_of parathas
various lassis
vegetarian grill stuff
etc
we didn't leave a peace
we just liked all the items
last but not the least
the staff are also courteous
don't come here alone
there's no seating and they won't give up a booth for one person
i would never recommend_this_place to whoever is looking for authentic_indian_food
it's not at all close to traditional_indian taste n palette
we went after checking a few reviews but as they say
don't judge a book by its cover
was so true
we tried mumbai pav bhaji and the only way to describe it was
urghhhh
what did i order
folks from mumbai will be thoroughly disappointed
the only thing i would recommend n give stars was the bhindi kurkure or okra fritters they were good
so my friends after a long drive to vegas if u r looking to relax the evening with a good indian dinner don't go this way
great off strip choice that is allergen friendly
all the options on the buffet are clearly labeled and so many choices are both gluten dairy free
gf breads only available for dinner buffet but no shortage of carbs
discounted prices for the kids are much appreciated
i like the blend of both north and south_indian choices
i've been to indian times and this food is fabulous
the restaurant full of indians seem to agree
will definitely eat here again next_time_i'm_in_vegas
we love_this_place
every time we have gone the food and service have been amazing
you can pretty much choose anything on the menu and be assured that's its good
we enjoy taking out of town guests here
of all the indian food places in vegas
this is my favorite
my wife and i came in for the buffet and it was excellent
the food is mildly spiced just the way i like
there are a strong variety of indian dishes to choose from
the tikka masala was delicious
i enjoyed the veggie khurma also
we have been disappointed several times with indian food places in vegas
this is is a must try
would recommend to my friends
stopped in for the lunch buffet after a morning of golf
on the recommendation of some of my indian coworkers
what a great find
the food was reasonably_priced and tasted great
a little spicier than most of the indian_restaurants i've been to
but that doesn't bother me
the buffet was pretty big i really like the chicken_korma and tika_masala
and the galob jamon for dessert was everything i hoped it would be
we had a mango_lassi
and a cherry lassi for the first time ever both were really good
can't_wait_to_go_back and order off the regular menu
came here for the lunch buffet
i do not know if the food here would be considered authentic
but i think the food is delicious and i was not disappointed at all
i would recommend_this_place
very good indian food
nann was thin and delicious
might just be my_favorite_indian_restaurant
it's been a while since i've treated my inner indian
so i tried this based_on yelp_reviews
i was not disappointed
ordered an appetizer of samosas
they were not quite as crispy and bursting with flavor as the ones i remember from my early years in south africa
but would definitely have them again
ordered the lamb karma korma for the entree
i asked for the mild spice
since i don't normally like the really hot dishes
but i probably could have gone with the medium_spice
flavors were well blended with a hint of sweetness
accompanied it with a side of garlic_naan
perfect for mopping up the left over sauce
i'll definitely come back again when i'm in town
this is an update from my last review
the dine in buffet at after noon is good
been several times for the lunch buffet
staff is helpful and friendly in pointing out vegan_options
very tasty
if even a bit greasy and salty
the
one tea bag tea is a bit pricey though
i'll stick with the buffet option from now on
what's up with the staff asking for my phone and e addy simply to place me in the que for a table
it's quite a nice restaurant though
especially considering the strip_mall it's in is not so hot
i've been craving indian curry for the longest
and mint always satisfies my
fix
service
our waiter was patient and answered every question i had
refilled our drinks in a timely manner
offered rice when i was running low
he was awesome
food
we ordered chicken tandoori
lamb_korma
garlic_naan and lamb samosa
chicken was cooked perfect
succulent white and flavorful
korma was so good that i took a piece of bread to scrape off the last drop
garlic_naan
who doesn't like garlic bread
the samosa was ok
nothing to rave about but still completes the experience
i can't_wait_to_try their_lunch_buffet
if your on the east_side of town
come check_this_place_out
told fianc i been wanting indian food for a while
we decided to head this way after the gym considering it was just down the street
service was great
at no time did they try to
rush us and was helpful patient when we were deciding on what to order
refilling our waters and even offering more basmati_rice when we were out
as far as food
we ordered lamb samosas to start with
a bit dry and needed some type of sauce but still good
our entrees were chicken_breast tandoori for me and lamb_korma for my date
we also ordered their infamous garlic_naan
i love anything on a sizzling plate
the chicken was moist and tender
my dish was not spicy at all
which is a plus for me because i can't_handle tooo spicy
paired perfectly with the basmati_rice and i even made a little sandwich bite with the naan
grilled onions
cut the chicken up and topped with yogurt_sauce
delish
the korma was a
and i guess it wasn't too spicy either but he likes spice so
he said he might go
next time
they also have an inferno menu where you have to sign waivers
i wonder how serious that is
lol
overall a great experience
wish we had room for dessert
until next time
yum
definitely one of my favorite places to grab a quick lunch
super close to unlv and the strip
very accessible
they usually have a lunch buffet which is a great price and if you are a unlv student you'll get like a discount as well
the food is delicious and their is a large variety of items in their buffet
they of course serve naan as well
my personal favorite is the garlic_naan because who doesn't love garlic
each time i have came they have always been super attentive and great with customer_service as well
love their bone in goat_curry
paneer
actually any paneer dish
tiki_masala
and you gotta get a lassi drink
especially if it's your first time at an indian place
definitely a good choice if you're in the neighborhood
over priced food that isn't worth the hype
we ordered the variety platter for two that included appetizers and dessert because we wanted to try as much food as possible
their tandoori_chicken is really good
but nothing else was impressive
our search for the best indian restaurant in las_vegas continues
my boyfriend surprised me on valentines day and took me to this restaurant
it's been awhile since i had indian food and so far this is one_of_my_favorites
i haven't try their kabobs but the curry's are to die for
i will definitely come and dine here again
the servers were so nice
really delicious indian food and good service
some of the best saag i've had in a while and chicken_tikka_masala had a rich hearty sauce
will_definitely_go_back
i haven't had indian food this good since i left chennai
india
everything was amazing from the naan_bread to the spicy chicken
even the indian beer
i highly_recommend this place
the food was great and the service was also
it's a small and unique feeling atmosphere at the mint_indian_bistro especially when the place is full
which seems to be most of the time
it might be because the food almost takes you to india with the wonderful smell of curry
garlic_naan and tikka masala in the air
we had a special valentine's dinner at the mint_indian_bistro and will definitely dine there again
maybe we'll bring friends
but if we all start doing that the secret will get out and you'll never get a table
i recommend you try this jewel of a spot and predict you'll be hooked too
my husband and i had no_idea_what to expect
we are not familiar_with_indian_food but the menu and the reviews were super enticing
for a person with lots of good restrictions this place is a gem
the staff is so helpful and knowledgable of all their food
our meal was delicious
can't_wait_to_try more on their massive menu
my wife and i have been wanting_to_try a new indian place for a while now
and omg are we happy we chose mint
everything was beyond delicious
seriously there are no words
i ate until it hurt and it was worth it
counting the days until we can go back
this place has good indian buffet
my all time favorite when ever i am in vegas
i am an indian
love the food here
homemade fresh
woooo
th reviewer
i've been here twice now the first time for dinner and the second time for the lunch buffet
i'll just go over the overall points
generally good service
sometimes the waiters are awkward and there was one young fellow in particular who looked like he hated his job
everyone is knowledgeable in the food and readily answers questions though
which is great for me because i barely know anything about indian food
the food is bomb and i'm seriously craving it right now
one time
the chicken in the chicken marsala was dry though
so that was strange
but overall
everything is seasoned to how i like it
a rare occurrence
and i was delightfully surprised by the mango yogurt
so good
outside of the lunch buffet
it's a little overpriced but you get a good amount of food made with quality_ingredients and care
i like that they label things in categories like vegan or gluten_free
very helpful for those who have limited diets
my favorite was probably this lamb dish during the lunch buffet which i cannot remember but i assure you
it was awesome
i love the garlic_naan
which i wish came in some heated basket
in my dreams
because it gets cold so fast
tastes so much better warm
great location by unlv and i'm trying to get a group to eat lunch there with me right now
at the end of a long day the of us who all love indian food decided that's what we wanted
we waited the minutes they told us it would take for our take out and the food was exceptional
i esp like the option of hot spice in a scale
nice folks too
if i could give more than stars i certainly would
indian good is absolutely one of my favorite cuisines
and the mint is most definitely the best in vegas
i have dined at nearly all the indian_restaurants around town and as a concierge it is my job to know the best places to dine in the city
i always refer my guests here for the authentic amazing food and genuine service
i can't wait until my next dining_experience
if you like to try_new_things i highly_recommend one of the tasting experiences you_will_not_be_disappointed
i probably wouldn't have ever ventured out to mint if it weren't for my vegan friends but i'm glad that i did
i have no concerns when it comes to food except for my slight lactose intolerance but if you are one of those who are vegetarian
vegan
or have any kind of dietary restrictions
mint is the spot for you
the first page of the menu explains what every symbol beside each entree means
so if you don't eat meat
dairy
gluten
nuts
and etc
mint has you covered
see photo below
our orders were taken on an ipad mini where every possible alteration to any dish is already programmed into the app that they use
i believe that they also have an app that you can download on your smart phones to order before coming into the restaurant
sweet
nice to see a restaurant seeking out new ways to better service their guests
not something you see everyday in most restaurants
food was excellent
the vegan tikka masala was great
i also tried my friend's potato curry which was good but i am a carnivore so i probably would've enjoyed one of their meat curries a bit more
heard great things about their_lunch_buffet so i will definitely have to come back for that
can't wait
very nice customer_service
i wish we would've just gone to our old standby tamba which was not even a block from the hotel
but the wife
who never wants to try anything new
wanted to try a new indian restaurant
the service was somewhat inattentive
we had hot supposedly chai_tea
but no one brought out any kind of sweetener until we requested some
i should've had a nice cold taj_mahal beer
the food was just fair with the standout being the malai_kofta
the tandoori mixed_grill
lamb and swordfish
and saag_paneer were pretty bland
i've had way better food back home in maryland
they spoiled me rotten apparently
next time we're in vegas and want indian we know where not to go
very good restaurant
we had mostly south_indian food
food was delicious
service was ok but they were bit crowded n able to accommodate our big group with little time
my favorite place to eat as always ron gives wonderful customer_service
the mango masala without nuts due to allergy
they also carry around a ipad so that you could see the picture of the food and they will describe the flavors
oh how i love_this_place
always a great atmosphere
good greetings and service that you would expect from higher end restaurants
very well run and the food overall is by_far_the_best_indian i've had
am from india
cheers
try the lamp stir fry with your kingfisher beer
awesome combo with the spicy lamb and beer
went for lunch buffet it was just ok
i've definitely had better
chicken_tikka_masala was dry
even though it was buried in gravy
pakora was burnt to a crisp
fresh garlic_naan brought to table was wonderful so was the tandoori_chicken juicy and flavorful
we have been here one other time
but we think it was even better this time round
took some friends and they loved it as much as we did
the flavors
the regions
all the fresh and organic ingredients
really made the food outstanding
good staff that is helpful in ordering the right combination of dishes
delicious and would recommend it highly and priced right
the lunch buffet has gotten so good here
oh my my a fantastic
large
and well executed selection of vegetarian and non_veg buffet items
a thicker tikka masala curry
both veg and chicken
than their previous recipe
a long row of creative curries
even chicken_vindaloo
full disclosure this was probably my th time eating the lunch buffet here and i have never liked it as much as this trip
i actually stopped coming here because i felt there was a lack of selection and no variety
always the same buffet items
the last time i came here was in the summer of
we were driving by and hungry and a what the hell moment ensued
we went to mint for the first time in almost a year
clearly lots has improved
and i am a huge fan
the mt
everest indian restaurant on sahara has a lot to live up to now
i've eaten at mt
everest close to times
mint is my new favorite indian lunch buffet spot in las_vegas
no contest
i really enjoy their_lunch_buffet
every time i eat here
i leave full and satisfied
i good place to eat for sure
if you live or are visiting_vegas this is a must
the food was amazing and well priced
i was dining with a vegan and though i don't typically eat vegetarian or vegan the food was amazing and i couldn't tell the difference
bold flavors
a foodie paradise
we had the vegan tasting menu all was really good
except the desert
some things just can't be vegan sorry lol
torn between giving a and a for my score
going to consider it a
rounded up for quality
was craving indian and saw a bunch of elites raved_about this place
so it made the top of my list despite being further than i wanted to travel
called in my order for takeout and headed on over
upon entering
saw that the restaurant itself was a bit nicer and more upscale than i expected
service was a bit lackluster waited for a bit at the door before being acknowledged
my boxed food was waiting at a table with a manager looking guy who brought over my receipt and took my card with a series of gestures
then ran my card and disappeared without a thank you or asking if i needed anything else
that probably explains why i didn't get any utensils or napkins
nor did i add on another side or additional naan as i'd originally planned
and there were only two tables seated at
pm so it's not because they were busy
i found this place to be a bit pricey
i like that half size entrees are available for a slightly lesser fee
but found that the decrease in pricing
usually around
isn't worth the decrease in product
lesson learned
for three half size entrees
one container of rice was provided
also ordered one garlic_naan
total was around
which is a bit steep
i always have difficulty paying so high for a la_carte indian food when the buffet prices are so cheap for so much
i feel like there's a discrepancy there that should result in lower prices rather than higher
but whatever
quality made my entree choices worthwhile
saag_paneer
baingan bharta
and lamb_korma
the saag was decent but i prefer mine a little saucier
this one was a lot of spinach and good sized cubes of paneer but the dish seemed as if it hadnt been cooked down long enough
best eaten with the garlic_naan
which was fragrant and delicious
baingan bharta was ordered exclusively based_on recommendations here on yelp
and i was not disappointed
it was flavorful and i appreciated that the sauce was on the thicker side
which allowed for it to go well with the rice
the lamb_korma is the only dish that had any spice to it whatsoever
and it was quite mild despite ordering a at thai restaurants
that'll get you a spicy dish
but i guess indian is a little more laid back with the scale
i know now for next time
dish didn't have quite as much lamb as expected for a portion
speaking of portions
i was a little confused by the portions and packing of my takeout
i appreciated that the half size entree portions were packed in plastic lidded containers and wrapped in plastic to ensure that nothing spilled
but the size of the portions themselves were on the small side think the smallest hummus containers at the grocery
that size
going to put this on the list to try again for the lunch buffet
thinking that will be a better value and possibly a better overall experience
good quality
vast menu of options including several vegetarian_dishes
atmosphere
modern and clean but also cozy at the same time
service
excellent to the point where the waiter seemed like he was always there
but hey
it's better than trying to flag down waiters
food
we got the pre fixe dinner for
there was so much food
it was essentially a dinner for
i like the pre fixe because you can try a little bit of everything without getting a full a la_carte sized dish
the dishes here are solid and fresh
excellent service and an extensive_menu
great value in all ways
we like it
pretty yummy
love their daal makhni garlic_naan
hmmm
quick
buffet style lunch
the wait_staff is very pleasant and attentive
we have been dying to come here
glad we finally did
taste_buds are pleasantly pleased
your constant companion
deirdra
as a guru indian
this is the best_indian_food_in_vegas
don't waste your time going anywhere_else
lunch buffet was great
not too pricey as well
freshly prepared garlic_naan was great too
vegetarian_options are little bit less but i guess how much one vegetarian can eat
it's okay
i would give three and half stars to this place
count my four stars as three and half really
the inferno menu is no joke
i eat all kinds of spicy food
i grind my own trinidad scorpion moruga
ghost
and habanero mix
i got crushed by the inferno curry
i had to stop halfway through my meal due to a stomach ache from the seven tablespoons of ghost chili powder that they use in the meal
the food tasted delicious and the service was great
i have become a fan of east indian food and mint_indian_bistro did_not_disappoint
the goat_curry and the eggplant curry were delicious
they of course had other curries
the service was excellent
they could be more friendly
however
they were not
standoffish
this is a must try in vegas
yummy
during lunch they offer a buffet and have about different entrees ranging_from vegetarian to those with meat
gluten_free options and a variety of sauces and accompaniments
this is a great way to sample different dishes without having to order the entire restaurant
but
indian food is not for those with a low tolerance for spicy
hot
food
the fresh naan is wonderful and great for dipping in these flavorful dishes because most entrees do contain a good amount of heat
probably on a thai scale
worth checking out and they open at am which reservations aren't really recommended till after pm
love_this_place
the staff is always pleasant and the food is delicious
being a vegetarian
they have tons of amazing options
i always leave here full and happy
this was definitely the best indian food i've had in a long while
went with some coworkers while at a conference and was impressed with the dish selection
descriptions to aid some of the folks in the group who hadn't had much indian food
and the helpful service
in a sea of glitz and glamour on the strip
this was a refreshing winner
the lunch buffet is one of the best indian_lunch_buffets i've ever had
with a great mixture of meat
veg
and vegan dishes so many if them were delicious
the tandoori_chicken was covered in grilled onions and lemon wedges
awesome
the garlic_naan was soft
warm
flavorful and the size of a side plate
and the rices were perfectly_cooked
the goat was tasty if you like the flavor of goat
there was also a dessert called gulab_jamun which was like donut holes soaked in syrup
each bite was like a juicy sweet sex party in my mouth lol
the only thing i wished was that the signage for the buffet items was more detailed
some of the names meant nothing to me
i might not've tried the gulab because i thought it was either a floating fruit or some kind of egg
lol
try this place
it's great
if_you_are_looking for the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
your search ends here
this is one of the few indian places that nails it down on quality
taste
service
ambiance and price
went here for a weekend lunch buffet
priced at
person
it is unbeatable good quality indian food
you could tell by the sheer number of indian folks eating here and the long queue of those waiting to get a table
the buffet had a varied collection of items including appetizers
salads
four veg
four non_veg curries
rice and dessert
some top show stoppers were vegetable_korma
paneer
idli sambar
veg pakoras
bhelpuri and naan
food was flavourful
hot and fresh
unlike many places where dishes just keep sitting for long on buffet racks
each curry tasted authentic
distinct from another and cooked_to_perfection
also tried their masala tea
not included in the buffet
and it was good
service was fast
attentive and friendly and this is despite the rush on a busy saturday afternoon
decor is simple yet pleasing to the eyes
for those of you
who might be tempted to try many other low priced indian_buffets in town
mostly at or
trust_me this one might be a little pricey but it is top value for your dollar
this place serves delicious food and has great ambiance service
tip
lunch hour gets real crowded on sat sun
so ditch the long waiting time
sometimes upto mins for a table inside and mins for an outside seating
by making it for an early lunch
also
if you are not used to having indian food
this could prove to be a little on the spicy side for you
so what could improve
this is for the restaurant owner management staff
do away with those paper cup glasses
they look cheap and take away the charm from the entire food experience
including a drink in the buffet like tea or mango_lassi can help you beat the competition that comes at a similar price
after spending a week in vegas on the strip
a few of us wanted to unwind with a more flavoured meal in quieter surroundings
we could not have picked a better place the decor is fine
and it is a very relaxing environment a far cry from the hustle and bustle of the strip
we started with popadoms and samosa chat
for the mains we had goat biryani
makhni daal
karahi chicken and garlic_naan
it was all very well prepared and presented
the 'hot' dishes were a bit mild for my taste
but after a week of eating at the hotels
it really was a joyous dinner
the service was absolutely top_notch and waiters made sure we were looked after without being over imposing
all in all a great place to go and eat when in vegas if_you're_looking for great food and the opportunity to unwind
food was tasty
they had a good buffet
i liked the mango_custard too
went twice for lunch buffet
food was okay
idly was not good
liked curd and mango_custard
easily the best indian place in vegas
amazing dishes and killer naan
the friendly service here is always a welcome bonus
try anything here
you'll love it
i came here around
on a saturday_night and was surprised at how busy it was
every table was full or had reservations except for one table outside and a small two person table top inside
my friend and i chose the small table top inside because the outside area didn't look too appetizing
i ordered the pakoda as an appetizer for the first time
i usually order the samosas even though i am not a huge fan
the pakoda was fried and had a nice flavor but i didn't taste much indian spice
i also ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
malai_kofta
garlic_naan
and mango_lassi
all of the curries were solid
my_only_complaint is that everything came out luke warm except for the garlic_naan
the garlic_naan came out piping_hot and i had to wait a while until i was able to tear it because it was not cut
mango_lassi was one of the best i have had and even though i was full i drank all of it
best indian i have tried in vegas but portions are kind of small for the price point
i've been to mint times about half the time for lunch buffet and half for dinner
tonight
we stopped for dinner to try their new menu
note
they have many new items on the menu and they continue to have their original items
the first page of the new menu is the inferno menu
all dishes on this page are made with ghost peppers
you have to sign a waiver before eating from this menu our server rs told us
there's one challenge that if you finish
you get your photo on their wall of fame and you get a mint gift card for future use
i don't think it's accepted by any hospitals
michael k
this might be something you'd want to try
in addition
the new menu has soups and salads and appetizers of various kinds
there are so many things to try it seems like a good uye with or people to share the items
for tonight
i chose the vertical vindaloo with lamb
the menu change also allows you to order vindaloo and choose the protein you want cheese
lamb
veggies
goat
bone in
swordfish
shrimp and you choose your spiciness from to
i chose
and i could have had more spice
or next time
my wife ordered the maharaja tikka masala with chicken_breast
again choice of protein similar to the vindaloo
she chose a spiciness of
we also got an order of buttered garlic_naan
everything was excellent
the vindaloo had good spicy flavor and the sauce was very flavorful
there were cut potatoes in the sauce
too
my wife enjoyed her dinner and she also expressed that it could be spicier
wow
are we going to or next time
what happened to my gabacha
the naan was the tastiest we've had here
it wasn't quartered like other times but served in one large round that we tore apart
after dinner
she got khir and i pistachio kulfi
i've had the khir before and while good
i wanted to try something different
the pistachio ice_cream was really
really good
i asked rs if it was made in house or could i go to the indian store and get it out of the freezer
sure enough
it's made in house
there goes that idea for a repeat
rs was quite a pleasant server
he refilled my iced_tea when i was getting low and he gave_us chance to look over the menu with no hurry and then was ready to answer any questions
i have a couple of other indian_restaurants to try
but for me
either for lunch buffet or dinner
mint tops all the others
it is very good
best indian indian food in all of vegas if not anywhere
incredible beer_selection and staff is on it
good prices for great food
currently sitting here in mint writing this review
we organized a group to come and try the inferno challenge
we arrived at pm so the non challengers could have the buffet and when the dinner menu started at pm the challenge could take place
on arrival we told the staff our plans
mins after arrival they inform us they don't have the ingredients for the challenge
so wasted trip for us
no retribution offered
just told to call them in a week to see if they have it again
the buffet is great
lamb_korma and chicken_tikka_masala are my faves and it is included in the lunch buffet
the interior of the place makes you feel like you're in a fine_dining restaurant
prices were reasonable
i will_be_coming_back
this is the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
hands_down
i travel all of the world and i'm careful saying something is good versus the best
if your used to eating trash indian food
you won't like this place
this is real indian food
you can am as judge an indian restaurant by the number of indians that come here as guests
every time i come here there are indian families here
the best part about it
it's off the strip only mins and most people are locals
i have been coming here for years and seen these guy seen these_guys grow
they have a huge beer_list
exotic
beer
gluten_free options
wife is gluten_free so this place always is a must
they are a hard working family that waits on every table regardless of who your server is
i've eaten here about times as its always consist
they will also click a taxi for you that can get there in about mins so no worries coming_back
if you have or more
plan on reservations
i went to mint on a recent trip_to_vegas
i had been there during my last trip and was so happy with their food that i decided to go back there
it was a wise decision
d
my family and i had meals there during this trip
the first was lunch buffet
they have so many dishes in the buffet and all of them taste excellent
the idli was super fluffy and the coconut_chutney tasted great
pakoda was super crispy and was made with all kinds of vegetables
chilli chicken was supremely tasty
came back very satisfied
happy and ready to gamble some more
the second time we went for dinner and again we were not disappointed
we had fried okra crispy fried okra chips
i had never eaten this before and thoroughly_enjoyed it
the food we ordered was really good
roti
mushroom mutter
served with rice
and idli sambar
the waiter serving us was super_nice and accommodated our change request after we had placed our order
excellent customer_service topped over excellent food is a great combination
will definitely go there again on my next trip_to_vegas
the atmosphere of the restaurant was a little strange at first
as soon as we walked in
the staff seemed a bit surprised to see us
they were friendly and courteous
but i got this
uh oh
vibe
once we were seated and started looking over the menu
things settled into a
ahh
vibe
looking through a menu for food that i'm not super familiar with can be a bit daunting
but i went with what i know about indian food
majaraja tikka masala
vindaloo
naan
saag and rice
can't_go_wrong
we were given an appetizer on the house i forget what it's called and forgive my ignorance but they were like super thin taco shells with a mint sauce and chutney
really great
we enjoyed them
then the main_dishes arrived
everything tasted awesome
their tikka masala is a bit more tangy than i am used to
but it was delicious
vindaloo was spicy
level
in a good way
not a burn on the way out way
we were devouring our food
nearby patrons were ordering lassi drinks but i was afraid that combo of lassi and curries would lock me up in the bathroom for too long
i'm really happy with our experience here and would definitely visit again during a long term vegas stay
i went here to meet up some friends for late lunch and surprisingly
there was still a wait at
pm
they have an ipad by the door so you can put your name down and the number of people in your party
i waited minutes which isn't bad
we came here for the lunch buffet since i've been hearing good things
our naan took a rather long time but at least they gave_us unlimited garlic_naan
there's another indian restaurant a few miles away from here that also has a lunch buffet but that place turned me off when they kept giving me excuses as to why they can't give me garlic_naan
i
e
we ran out of garlic
when there's a supermarket right behind them
this place is in a better location and looks nicer and cleaner
the service is better too
for less than for a buffet
you can't_go_wrong
i liked that there's a good variety_of_dishes for their_lunch_buffet
tikka masala
palak_paneer
tofu
veggies
spicy chicken
curry and other savory dishes
their gulab_jamun was just right hot
sweet and cheesy balls
yum
the food was excellent
hooray for huge chunks of chicken
the sauces were spot on
there was this mystery dish that we all tried without reading the label was it cheese or was it tofu
it was the texture of cubed mozzarella without the stomach ache inducing property of cheese on somebody who's lactose intolerant
so
it probably was tofu
i'll definitely come back again and again
the staff was awesome
they seated us in minutes even thought we didn't have a reservation
the food was as usual amazing
i would come back again
i loved the mango_lassi
and the pineapple curry
my husband had the chicken saag and was very very happy
sitting at the mint
ordered different wines and they were out of all of them
my friend had decided to get ras malai as soon as she saw it on the menu and come to find out the didn't have any
why list them on the menu if you don't plan to carry or serve this food
moreover
we asked for not too spicy food and one of our curry was really spicy
the service was good
food when not spicy was as good as other indian restaurant in the area
and the decor is very bland
maybe i went here on their off day so gave them stars
may return to see if things have improved
otherwise there are better choices out there for indian food
i tried mint for the first time today
walking in i was immediately bombarded with wonderful smells
we were greeted at the door by a friendly host who turned_out_to_be our server
he was friendly
prompt
and attended to our table often
but not often enough to be annoying or pushy
we ordered the prefix vegetarian meal for
spicy level
and the andrha curry
spicy level
we were three people but had enough for or
the appetizer soup was excellent
the naan was fresh
and all the dishes were excellent
food
prices
reasonable
ambience environment
casual
but could be great for a date or business lunch
service
fantastic
i can't wait to be back
bad customer_service here and people are super slow
i asked the waiter to add one more item to our order and he said he doesn't know who our table helper is and simply left without letting us know whether he added or not
secondly
it took an_hour to get the order
overall super bad experience
excellent food
i came to mint_indian_bistro today for the first time since i am staying in las_vegas
we were seated quickly and got our food
the nan came after some time though
the reason this is stars and not is because there wasn't much variety for someone like me being a vegetarian and not likening very spicy food
but overall excellent food and i would recommend the paneer_tikka_masala
that was not extremely spicy but still very good
the lunch buffet was excellent with some items i've_never_seen at other restaurants
also
every item was labeled for dietary restrictions
vegetarian
gluten_free
etc
had the
lunch buffet and was impressed with the quality and selection of offerings
fresh garlic_naan was available as was unusual items such as sambhar and mixed pickle
love the dishes that combined ginger
coconut and garlic and the halal offering was just as tasty
they have a good variety of beer choices too
tamba is a delightful indian restaurant in the hawaiian_marketplace
http

with a spacious dining_room and exceptionally polite staff
tamba offers a lunch buffet
you can get a off coupon from their_website or by picking_up the free restaurant guide near the entrance
they claim to be the
only indian restaurant on the strip
located in the hawaiian market
this is a hidden_gem that many may over look
at first i was a little hesitant to try indian food
but what better way to try it than with my indian bf and his entourage of cousins
aunties
uncles and parents
we came here one saturday evening for dinner and i fell in love with the setting
it's nothing like restaurants you see on the strip
it had a buffet
large lounge love seats with over stuffed pillows and an orange and gold scheme that made you feel like you were in india itself
or so i imagined
being with the crowd i was with
it was great because some of them were not too fond of extremely spicy food so we got a lot of mild dishes
you can just tell the staff to make it mild and they will do so
the vegetarian_dishes were great
we started_off_with dishes like the kurkari bhindi okra with brown onions and had chicken_tikka for our entree
the naan had a great texture for scooping up all the sauce left over
i really enjoyed the dining_experience and i think that i owe my love for indian food to this restaurant
this is a great for a first timer
we went in a group of for their saturday lunch buffet
the vegetarian_dishes were pretty good saag_paneer
paneer matar
daal
rice
etc
the non_veg weren't that good except for the chicken_tikka
idlis tasted like they were microwaved from having prepared them a few days_ago
sambar wasn't too bad
the gulab jamoon was ok
hard to cut with a spoon
overall
it was ok considering it is one of the very few indian food options on the strip
i declare this place
the best vegetarian food i've had in vegas
baby
food
they get the spicing right
atmosphere
cool but more in a san_francisco than vegas way
service
attentive and friendly
in vegas for a convention
and not really that happy with the bazillions of
hotel
restaurant choices
while recognizing that many of them are exceptionally good
and wanting something vegetarian
i looked these_guys up and was impressed by their_website
i went alone
as the rest of my compadres were busy at the blackjack tables
or somewhere_else doing more
vegasy
things
and the hostess sat me immediately
gave me a menu
and made sure i received my h
the waiter came
discussed the wine and beer_list and suggested a beer the name i forget
but it was great
i ordered the navrattan korma
and sort of expected your typical indian navrattan korma
but was pleasantly_surprised to receive it with a nice kick seriously spiced right
very tasty
when he first put down the dish i figured i'd eat about half of it
but i polished it off and would have continued eating if there had been more
i've been to vegas a few times
and have never been all that happy with the food
so it was a real treat to go somewhere this good
it was truly the best meal i have ever had in las_vegas
this is my wife's fav indian_restaurant_in_vegas
i don't share that but the food is decent here
they do have the best selection of vegetarian stuff for their_lunch_buffet
i like the atmosphere much more here than say gandhi or india_oven too
i am a stickler for white_meat chicken at indian_buffets and they didn't have it here surprise
surprise
i think india_oven and gaylord buffets are the only ones that have it
indian food for two
walking upstairs at the hawaiian_marketplace
you'll be surprised to see this dimly lit restaurant and its ample seating_area
they offer a buffet lunch and dinner a la_carte
it's hard when you want to try a bunch of different stuff when it's just you and the bf
but tamba offers a couple of 'feasts' to help satisfy that curiosity
for
the bf got the ashoka's feast which comes with
tandoori_chicken
spring chicken in a mildly spiced ginger yogurt_sauce
it came with two drumsticks and two breasts
a decent amount to start his meal
there were three dipping_sauces the mint one
a chutney of some sort
and a dark purplish one
i'm not a particular big_fan of tandoori
but the bf ate three pieces of it
lamb_curry
cubes of lamb cooked with onions
tomatoes
garlic
red chilies
and pickling spices
it tasted a bit gamey for me
but we did enjoy dipping our nan_bread into the sauce
chicken_tikka_masala
chunks of boneless chicken roasted in the clay_oven and then served in a mild curry_sauce
the chicken was white_meat
and pretty flavorless
but the curry_sauce was so good
i wish i had a bucket of that to dump all over my rice and to smother my nan_bread with
next time i'll tell them to skip the chicken and give me more of that sauce
kali dal
slow cooked black lentils with a medley of spices
the bf thought this would taste just fabulous in a burrito
as in skip the black beans
refried beans
or pinto
and add some black lentils instead
pretty tasty stuff and good with the nan_bread too
rice a generous scoop coupled with a few green peas for decoration
needed to enjoy all the lovely sauces the meal has to offer
nan
white flour tandoori bread
a must when eating indian food
my preferred choice when soaking up any kind of curries
especially those that come with tikka masalas
raita condiment based_on yogurt used as a sauce or dip
served chilled and has a cooling effect when eating spicy dishes
i'm not a big_fan of the raita and was only dumping it on the rice 'cuz the bf was doing it
i can pass on this
daily dessert two small donut like holes sitting in a bath of butter and honey
oh so sweet and a nice finish after a hearty indian dinner
i ordered up the buddha's feast for and this is what i got
vegetable_samosa
crisp golden brown pastries stuffed with mildly seasoned potatoes and peas
the order came with two samosas
and two dipping_sauces
the bf was pretty impressed by these
and i'm lucky that i had two to share
malai_kofta
chunks of cheese tossed in a mild buttery cream_sauce
it came with one chunk of cheese only
which i couldn't even tell was cheese
i thought it was a mixture of chickpeas or something
the sauce was okay
and good for dipping
saag_paneer
spinach with our special cottage_cheese cooked in a karahi with house spices
it came with one piece of cottage_cheese
and i think it lacked flavor
the bf said it had been sitting out too long and this is one of his favorite indian dishes
kali dal
rice
nan
raita
daily dessert
the feasts are presented quite nicely on a large platter and it's a decent amount of food
you definitely get the chance to taste a few different things without breaking the budget or ordering too much food
the bf also ordered a mango_lassi that he found a bit too sweet for his liking
i thought it tasted fine
but was more watery than what i'm used to
service was good our_water_glasses were filled without asking
the only complaint was that our main_courses came out too quickly after our appetizers
we had to help the waiter move some dishes around while we were still eating and he was juggling the huge platters
there's also a back room available for private parties with a more family_style seating
sidenote
you can get a off coupon entree at the tix less booth downstairs
or a coupon from their_website
check out the pics of our eating in the business profile
i echo some of the other reviewers by saying that this is my favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
i don't usually like to go to the strip to eat
unless it's a special occasion
but tamba is worth it
it is very upscale in decor
yet has good ethnic flavor to it as well
waiters are attentive
but not overly so
which i hate
the buffet choices are excellent and all food is fresh and warm and tasty
the only drawback
it is closed for a couple of hours before dinner time
i belive
pm or so
i like my dinner early sometimes
and it was a bid of a disappintement
overall
recommended
very clean place
i ate here once for valentine's day dinner
the image i gleaned from their_website made it appear to be all plush pillows
flickering candles
and meditating statuettes
the internet can be so deceiving
first of all
the chic dining_area they prominently display on their_website
which is
and i quote
designed as a hipster hangout and features plush seating beneath the striking murals of international artist farhad elahi
is their reserved banquet dining_room
tucked far away in the backend of the restaurant
regular parties eat in a much less interesting and unromantic dining space
complete with standard tables and chairs
i suppose the general vim of this spot is acceptable for lunch or a casual dinner
but it was v day and i wanted to sit on a sexy red pillow damnit
exacerbating the ambiance situation was the food situation
being adventurous not to mention gluttonous we pretty much ordered one of everything
the mulagatani soup was an unremarkably flavorless bowl of pepper and water
while the other pakistani style dishes were just as boring and lacking in flavor and heat
the service sucked
especially considering it was v day
this place is in sync with the line of reasoning adopted by its sister restaurants around the valley
gandhi's and gaylord's
in that hiking up your prices and offering a wine_list somehow makes you less of a mediocre north_indian pakistani spot and more of a
and i quote
hipster hangout
next please
given that we were hella drunk and hella hungry
but the food was awesome
we got appetizers and each of them were good
dont remembr what we got though
for dinner
we got bhindi
totally awesome
daal was great
malai_kofta was good but a very small helping and we got some chicken
the food was served in exactly minutes after we ordered
the good is it was before time
the bad is
it was all prepared in advance
the rotis and the paranthas were very good
we had kheer and gajar ka halwa
i highly_recommend this place on the strip
food was heavy so we walked to our condo at the signature next to mgm
nothing special
decent seating
good service
nothing extraordinary about the food
it tasted like any average indian place
but i don't have high expectations from an indian place in las_vegas
would i go there again
yes
for an pm reservation on a saturday_night
i didn't have a problem getting in
when we got to the restaurant
it was relatively empty
when we left
there were many more people
the website is kinda deceiving
they show the nice lounge area
which is not where they seat you for dinner
the lounge area was nice
but it wasn't open at all when i was there
and i left at pm
the food was pretty good
i couldn't believe that the entrees didn't come with naan or anything
everything
dal
naan
etc
had to be ordered a la_carte
for an extra charge
we ordered the naan and roti which only came with four pieces each
maybe i'm just used to going to places where the naan is free and you get it by the basket load
i would_definitely_go_back again if i wanted indian food while in vegas
the service was excellent too
very attentive and quick
the best indian food i've tried so far
and i've tried a lot
in many different places all over the world
they use a tandoor oven
so you can find some healthy dishes that taste really great
their vegetable dishes are incredible as well
i love their buffet too
because you can try all the different dishes and figure_out what it is that you like
everything is labeled so you know what you are getting
the atmosphere is nice
and the service is great
oh
their food is so good
i think i will go there now
we had a fairly late dinner there and suprisingly found very authentic_indian_food you can really taste the difference in the spices
friendly
efficient service
i vow to try the buffet next time we are back in vegas
tamba was my first indian food experience
i went here for the the first time a few months back for dinner
and i would really like to go back again
it's kind of hidden all the way in the back of the hawaiian_marketplace
but the food is really good
i tried the murg biryani
which was a very flavorable chicken rice dish with nuts and raisins
my favorite part would have to be the raisins
it gave the dish a very surprising sweetness to it
i also had a sample of my friends' chicken_korma curry and tandoori_chicken
which were both good as well
i would love to go back and try more different dishes
go for the food
not the ambiance
we were in vegas for my sister's wedding
indian
my extended family pretty much ate here everynight except one
the reception
the buffet is great for vegetarians
they keep it fresh and warm
the food is excellent and lots of choices
the meat stuff was good too
but i was too fully from everything else
the service was fair
our nephew has some food allergies and they were not overly accomadating in tyring to prepare something outside the buffet
there seems to be a caravan of indian tourist buses that roll thru the area in the evenings
so be prepared for it to be busy
would i go back
yes
on the strip
this place is a gift from guru nanak
if picked_up and dropped anywhere_else in the world
it's pretty good
north_indian type food here is nothing inspiring
but satisfying
we had the buffet and my vegetarian man was happy
i was happy with the food decent naan
mint_chutney
tandoori_chicken the usual stuff i get
the best part was being off the strip and away from the
hey bro
douchebags
it was clean and quiet
this is hard_to_find on the strip and a i relished the calm
grabbed a buffet dinner
the spread was great
lots of vegetarian_options
desert was probably the weakest
but very good food overall
ate the
lunch time buffet on a monday and it was very disappointing
the food was oily and seemed to be sitting out for a long time
oddly
the place seemed busy
which made me think one of two things
a
being the only indian restaurant on the strip
tamba's owners clearly aren't worried about quality
b
tamba's dinner menu must be amazing to compensate
customer_service is worst
the night buffet is worst
the food doesn't look fresh
recommend not to go there
specially in the night
when i moved to vegas from australia i worried that decent indian food was going to be a thing of the past
few americans i spoke to dreamed of eating a curry
and it's tough to find in supermarkets
but i need not have worried
vegas has a great array of indian food available of varying quality
i have tried it all and the one place the wife and i keep_coming_back to is tamba
oddly situated at the back of the abandoned hulk that is the hawaiian_marketplace foodcourt
tamba is in my opinion the best food to be had anywhere on the strip
everything is spiced to perfection and there's a great array both for meat_eaters and vegetarians
the lunch buffet is sensational value
confused at the people here saying the service is bad rude
i can barely take a sip of my water before a polite
to the point of humble
waiter is rushing to top me up
tamba offers a lunch buffet on the weekends that is quite satisfying
plenty of choice
including salad y stuff
entrees
desserts
and plenty to satisfy either vegetarians or meat_eaters in your party
it was all very good
especially the vegetable_curry i tried
the staff is helpful
the dining_room is nice
the only thing that would have improved the experience for me would be
being hungrier and
labels on the buffet choices
the staff were happy to answer our questions about any of the food
however
is a perennial complaint i have with indian_buffets
i like indian food immensely and would like to learn more about it so i can remember what i especially like
but all of the indian places i frequent are label less
so except for stuff that's easy to identify like curry
i am left describing things as
that green goopy thing
and
that orange goopy thing
and
that other thing with the lamb
whenever i have out of town friends
i bring them to tamba
i love the furniture and the food
there are so many vegetarian_dishes to choose from
pretty reasonable too in price
very friendly
spacious and tucked_away
wish they had parking nearby
aside from the feeling that you are entering a deserted mini mall when you go to tamba
this place is pretty good
i am in vegas quite a bit for work and my coworkers and i are always searching for dinner options that don't require you to win big before you can eat
thanks to open table
we found this hidden little gem
the feeling of the restaurant is pretty generic
the website gives the impression that you will be walking into a luxurious setting complete with red velvet cushions and dramatic draperies
um
not so much
but we clearly weren't looking for trendy so no big_deal
we had booked a party of
which ended_up being a party of four
the host was nice about it
but
unfortunately the restaurant doesn't have too many options for tops so we ended_up sitting at a table for six
i guess they get a lot of large groups
i started with a manhattan
when it came out a dark red
i was a little concerned that it wasn't made correctly
but after tasting
it was just right
i had the butter_chicken
which was rich and delicious
but not too heavy
my friends didn't really know what they wanted so the server just brought out a few different dishes to share
one of my friends had a spicy chicken dish that was fantastic
in hindsight
i wish we would have asked what they were
all in all
it was a great meal
friendly service
and we were all able to get out of there for around per_person
woo hoo
one of the places where you can get jain food
the waiter even wrote jain in front of the items
so i suppose they might be getting a lot of jain customers
we ordered the following jain items this time
malai paneer
yellow daal
mutter_paneer
the last time
around years_ago
they also made jain malai_kofta
during dinner
i have been to this place around times and its always a saviour
this time around they were very busy so the service sucked
its not like this always
but yes sometimes we take the buffet
so not much service is required anyways
we could see several people waiting to be seated and they were also getting a little bit frustrated
would_definitely_recommend_this_place for good jain food
shockingly good
i am most grateful to my fellow yelpers for drawing our attention to this establishment
we never would have ventured into the hawaiian_marketplace for food never
after reading the reviews and finding a coupon in the vegas booklet
we went
it was exactly as stated
totally deserted
we wondered whether it was open when we arrived at about
by the time we left
it filled to overflowing with mostly indian clientele
which is telling
i think the dinner buffet began around pm
my husband and i are big fans of indian
but we always find it hard to get really good and not just mediocre indian_cuisine
there's lots of mediocrity out there in terms of indian
tamba was really really tasty
we tried two new dishes which we enjoyed
the first was panipuri
an indian street_food
which involves a hollow shell made of indian crispy bread which you fill with a green spicy sauce which is supplied separately
thanks to our server who told us how to eat it
it's fun
like a shot of mild spice
the other dish we had was the dessert which came with the ashoka's feast
it was made of dried carrot and nuts
now
i have this weird thing against cooked carrots
they make me gag
but i love raw carrot
it's strange
so anyhow
i was not aware of what this dish
gajar halva
was made out of
i asked the waiter
it tasted nothing like carrot
it has this amazing texture and sweetness
i highly_recommend it
like most extra american dishes
i find that you should eat it without knowing what it is
i think many americans have preconceived notions of what things should taste like and their texture so knowing what you're eating is more apt to gross you out than allow you to experience it
oh yea
while the food was excellent here and the service
the ashoka's feast is not really enough food for two people
we ordered the pani puri as an appetizer with this in mind and even though i wasn't starving
it was barely enough food
it was all very tasty
but i wish we had ordered a bit more food
especially now as i write this really wishing i was in vegas eating some tamba
i also did not find tamba to be generic in any way
it was decorated nicely and was lit well
somewhat romantically
and quiet
yes
very very good
i'd recommend the lunch buffet for value_for_money
same as the evening grub
for of the price
great service and vibe
they do a fine job here
most of their vegetarian items beat the hell out of other indian buffet vegetarian items
sadly
their meat items do not beat the hell out of other indian buffet meat items
good price
nice service
nice ambience
i like it
good and unique flavors
decent prices
the saag_paneer was decent but rice had to be ordered separately
the naan was good and the ashokas feast was a good variety of flavors
surprising for the strip
a nice change of pace
would return if invited
oh yelpers
how you have failed me
my boyfriend and i found tamba's advertisement in one of vegas's books during our visit
and decided to go here for dinner after reading the
good reviews
and ratings on yelp
after finally having eaten there
i would give this place half a star if i could
for its bad food and terrible service
i live in silicon valley a mecca of indian_restaurants and cafes and eat indian food at_least_once_a_week
it's my latest addiction
i know good curry when i taste it
and let_me_tell_you now before you waste your time and money
you will not find good curry here
we went for the
dinner buffet
which
it turns_out
was reserved for private parties only
so we ended_up ordering the butter_chicken and a lamb_curry with some naan off of the menu
but the waiter brought out what he called
chicken_tikka_masala
and when we told_him it wasn't what we ordered
he then said he misspoke and it was actually
butter_chicken
after all
either way
it tasted like water
no flavor whatsoever
the lamb_curry on_the_other_hand
was a spoonful of salt with every bite
yuck
i've never abandoned an indian meal in my life
no matter how mediocre
but i could not get myself past even half this meal
maybe the bland curry juxtaposed to the salty one made it seem even saltier
or
maybe
i thought
if i mix the two curries together
i would find a happy medium
how wrong i was
there was no happiness to be found there
to top it off
when our bill came
we were charged for the
chicken_tikka_masala
instead of butter_chicken
and told our server about the mistake
he said
it doesn't matter anyway
they're the same price
indeed not
i corrected him and said that the butter_chicken is
so he responded
fine
i'll just comp you the difference
comp
comp
are you kidding me
you're not comping us anything
we're just asking you to charge us for what we actually ordered
don't think you're doing us any favors
finally
just to add insult to injury
they advertised off the bill if you showed them the ad from the vegas booklet
but when we gave him the
coupon
instead of taking off
he added to our bill for gratuity
ha
unbelievable
i guess
in vegas
you don't have to go to the casinos to lose your money
i came here with my coworkers after a long boring sunday at work
eating here was definitely the highlight of my day
we ordered
chicken_tikka
delicious cubes of flavorful chicken served with sides of mint as well as tamarind sauces
tandoori_chicken
delicious preperation
i only wish the cuts of chicken were meatier
chicken_tikka_masala
my_favorite_dish
full of flavor and soft tender chicken pieces
the sauce base is perfect for dipping your naan into
chicken_vindaloo
the spice_level was perfect
it was spicy enough for those who are adventurous
but it wasn't so spicy that is took away from the wonderful flavor
yellow fried_rice
great flavor
perfect accompaniment to the tandoori_chicken
naan
plain butter and garlic
both were excellent
flaky with a soft fluffy center
drinks
bombay
sapporo beer
strawberry daiquiri
the service was fantastic both from the waiter and the bussers
the ambiance was excellent and the decor and dishes they used to serve the food were very modern
i would not hesitate to take a date here
food and service were excellent
i went with a group_of_people and everyone's order was correct
prompt and served at the same time
drinks were refilled immediately
the food was flavorful and as described on the menu
i would give it stars
with the exception that i didn't have to pay the bill
so i can't really comment on the costs and or the value aspect of this place
i love the lunch buffet at this place
the food is great
the chicken_makhani is just awesome
everytime i eat here
i get up to get food from the buffet around times or so
the place looks nice also
can't_wait_to_go_back next_time_i'm_in_vegas
went to tamba while visiting_vegas
honestly
we found this place because we had a coupon from the entertainment book
we ended_up going twice
our first dinner there was on sunday_night we fell in love with the place
the waiters were friendly_and_helpful
we were given a second dessert for free because we were told we had to try that one too
we were so happy that we did
my first visit to tamba food
service
perks gets stars
we went back to tamba a few days later with a friend
the food was still good
but seemed saltier than sunday
we had ordered different dishes so not sure if the saltiness was just due to our order
we still enjoyed the food and the service was good
but a little off on the timing
barely touched appetizer before main_course came out
one of the servers seemed annoyed by the use of the coupon
but otherwise
it was still good
second visit
stars
i disagree with any bad comments on this place
maybe the buffet isn't the greatest but in general buffets are never that good
all the food just sits around
on that note
me and my boyfriend went and ate here about a week ago bc a friend i had in my summer class at unlv worked here
although he wasn't there that night we went anyways and everyone was so nice
the service was excellent and the food was fantastic
i completely disagree with the yelp from sang whatever bc we ordered the chicken_tikka_masala and it was awesome
we also got the lamb_vindaloo and the combo together was phenomenal
the chicken_tikka was so buttery and had a great flavor while the lamb_vindaloo had the perfect amount of heat
we had samosas of course and they were pretty good
from my memory i've had better but everything else was delicious
our water was never empty and everyone was so nice
we also had some dessert
a round cake like ball thing
dont know what its called
and some carrots
very good as well
the location is a little strange
i thought it was closed when we were going there
but they were open
the atmosphere was great
the service was great
and the food was awesome
the rest of the night me and my boyfriend kept saying how nice of a dinner that was and have been craving_indian_food ever since
a
hands_down the worst indian buffet i've ever been to
and to the people who say that you can't expect much from buffet food
you just haven't been to a good indian buffet
i admit there are some things i've come to expect from an indian buffet
like that the naan should probably be freshly brought out to the table
rather than wasting away en masse under a hot light
the core of the meal
the proteins
should also not be mystery meat bobbing in a thin gruel of oil and colored sauce
the most edible thing was probably the goat_curry
and only because i love me some lamb goat
there were little signs to help you navigate the curries
as we discovered later
but they misidentified stuff and were hard to read
the place looks nicer than it tastes
fo sho
pathetic
i read_the_reviews of this place before coming and found it interesting that there was such a spread of opinions
my experience with yelp_reviews has been that they tend to clump together around a mutually agreed upon rating but this one had people who loved it and people who hated it
my fellow diner and i agreed that
stars is just about the correct rating though
impressions
the place is nicely_decorated with low light and soft music
it is upstairs in a a grim looking food_court in the back of a low rent outdoor shopping_center
it has a nice ambiance once inside though
we went for the lunch buffet
pros
very friendly_and_attentive staff
my_water_glass never reached the half way empty mark
plenty of vegetarian selections in the buffet
the chicken_tikka_masala and a paneer curry
i missed the name
were both very good
cons
the daal was overly salty
some dishes were just okay and not spectacular
overall we had a nice lunch here but i've had better indian_buffets in the bay_area
in the midst of a sea of burgers and undercooked pizza slices however this is a welcomed change
indian food is by far my favorite
and i was so pleased to run into tamba on the strip
we came during lunch and were able to eat off of the buffet and get unlimited non alcoholic drinks for
being vegetarians
we were totally stoked that they had at least different dishes in addition to rice
naan
and those weird soda break things
i learned that i love dal makni
malai paneer
and punjabi curry
which would be things i would normally not get to try because i always order my favorite
muttar paneer
anyway
the service was really great
the location was awesome
and the food was so incredibly tasty
five_stars alllll the way
i had the lunch_special
and it included some very traditional indian_fare that most americans would not ascribe to indian food
the buffet was vegetarian heavy
which i loved as i favor the southern style
waitstaff was friendly
the decor was pleasantly better than expected
considering this was not a strip hotel restaurant
i guess i would describe the food as not particularly gourmet
but utterly satisfying
not bad for a semi vacant strip_mall
if i ever go back to vegas
i will have to try dinner a a la_carte
i have never tried the sit_down dinner menu
but i am a huge_fan_of the all_you_can_eat lunch buffet for
great environment and very clean
yum_yum for tamba
one of the best restaurants i've ever been to
exceptional service
we eat fine restaurants all the time in san_francisco and this beats all
my best experience in vegas
everytime i have visited this restaurant
or its sister restaurant
gandhi
the food has been consistently good
the price is reasonable
for a buffet and i always enjoy my meal
the mango_lassis are great as well
but the service could always be improved
the location is a pain
considering that you have to enter through a sm
side street on the strip and getting out of there will be a nightmare
i always exit from the back side and you will need to know that trick to avoid all that traffic from las_vegas strip
if you are in town
it's worth the visit to either of the two restaurants
i have been eating at gandhi for over yrs
now
since tamba is a little more recent
food is still good
the only downside of tamba is trying to locate it in the back of the run down hawaiian_marketplace
the food is outstanding
the buffet lunch is great at
per_person and features a very good malai paneer
the staff is friendly_and_attentive
as an added bonus
the interior is very classy
my family recently visited us from london and we all went to this excellent place
upon our arrival we were greeted nicely and then they seated us in this exclusive area because they thought we were the people taking a tour
it was hilarious when they came and told us how they had made a mistake and apologized extensively for there inconvenience
i think everything is fine with this restaurant but i would prefer ordering over their buffet
the bathrooms need to be more clean
besides that the place is nice and chic
there is this huge market below this where you can get cheap stuff from sunglasses to shawls and other materials
the food was very tasty
a touch on the spicy side
but that can be expected with indian food unless you ask for it to be mild
the setting was beautiful
calm and relaxing
most of the staff was wonderful
our main waiter paid no attention to our table at all
but the other staff made up for it
if you want a great beer
try the taj_mahal
the people here are running more a business than a place for some indian food
i observed the owner manager to be very business minded be cared to the customers with such perspective
thats different story
who cares if the food end up delicious
which isn't the case
less than average taste
not all the items in menu are available
the only advantage its at the strip
else i liked the food http

everestcuisine
net
far better than in tamba during my day visit to vegas
weekend lunch buffet review
our plan was to find some grub at aria but we either found stuff that was too expensive or not very appealing
by this time we were starving so i whip out my trusty iphone and used my yelp app to find this place just across_the_street
it's located in the hawaiian_marketplace all the way in the back
the first thing we did after we entered was pay the for the weekend lunch buffet
i thought that was a bit strange but if the hotel buffet places can do it why not
they had a lot of variety
at least different items
and thought everything was just ok
one thing i thought was really good was their upma
it's like an indian version of the moroccan cous cous
it was my first time having the dish and it was simple yet very tasty
the chicken tandoori had good flavor but was a little dry
the chicken_tikka_masala sauce was good but there wasn't a lot of chicken
i had to dig around for some
what i noticed is that this place supplied small containers for the different dishes
i've_never_seen that before and thought it's a good idea for those who don't like mixing their food
they were pretty good with refilling our water cups and clearing our dirty plates
bad thing with this buffet was drinks weren't included so a separate bill was handed to us
another downside was the food wasn't labeled properly
so i was just grabbing things blindly
overall it was just an ok experience
at least tamba introduced me to a new dish
now all i have to do is find it here in la
the lunch buffet was very good with many options
there were three or four meat items and six or seven veggie items
the naan was excellent and all the items seemed fresh and were very hot
there were many indians eating here
which is always good
they could lose the plastic water cups though
that seems a little silly
when i am in vegas
very rarely do i wake up in time to have lunch
i have been to tamba times before and always for dinner pre dinner
there food has always been good
but the service with attitude has always turned me off
i would not waste my time typing this if it was not for their value_for_money lunch buffet i had last time
it comes to per_person and it has lots of variety
none of the items are truly great
but none are bad too
now only if they would serve you water in something other than those cheap iparty plastic cups
we enjoyed the buffet and it was reasonably price of
i would recommend visiting here
first of all
moderators
can you correct the name of the restaurant
it's really tamba indian_cuisine lounge
i see that the right url is provided
so let's make it easier for other people to find this indian gem
since this was my first time out as a las_vegas resident
i was extremely pleased to discover that las_vegas does indeed have stellar indian_cuisine
i read the first review carefully and already knew it was considered excellent by indian natives
but when i arrived and saw that virtually everyone in the restaurant was indian
i knew it was going to be superb and it was
my perennial favorite
lamb_vindaloo
was as spicy as it should be
the lamb was tender
although i've tasted superior lamb
namely in paris
as a starter i ordered onion kulcha
the waiter brought out the nan accompanied_by a plate of tomatoes
onions
jalapenos and pickled vegetables
i knew then and there that i would be in for a treat
the rice was excellent although i prefer mine laced with peas and authentic cardamom seeds
but for most food lovers this is probably adventurous enough
in all
a great find in las_vegas
don't let the hawaiian_marketplace surroundings fool you
this is truly outstanding indian food and las_vegas deserves it
mighty tasty
service was excellent
highly_recommended if seeking well prepared indian_cuisine
great recommendation from caesar's palace conceirge
this really is the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
i was trying to find a nice place to take my girlfriend for her birthday dinner
first
we were looking for a greek place
but didn't find any with decent reviews
so since we have had good luck with indian food in the past
i figured i'd scour yelp for suggestions
i found tamba to be in the top five on yelp and found every place in the list to have mixed reviews
after looking at the web sites of the top five
their menus and plenty of thought
i finally decided on tamba
i used opentable
com to make our reservation for pm saturday_night
since this place is in the hawaiian_marketplace on the strip
i figured it would be packed
in fact
one of the reviews said to make sure you get a reservation or your wait could exceed two hours
when we arrived
the place was pretty empty
i believe there were only four or five tables taken at that point
so we were greeted_by the manager and he wished my girlfriend a happy birthday
nice_touch
i am actually glad the place was empty because the waiter spent a lot of time talking over the menu options and giving us recommendations
during our conversation with the waiter
we talked about the lamb dishes and he could tell we were hesitant
so he brought over sample for us to try
it was so good
i chose the roghan gosht as my main_dish
my girlfriend chose the butter_chicken and we started with the sea bass appetizer
on the spice scale
i'd say the lamb was a out of and the butter_chicken was a
the wine selection was average
but my girlfriend really enjoyed the fruity martini
the price was better than i expected for dinner on the strip in las_vegas
we both had two drinks
an appetizer
two main_dishes
rice
garlic_nan and two desert items and got out of there for around and that included the tip
two more signs that tamba serves good indian food
by the time we left
ish
the place was packed and there were a lot of actual indian people dinning there
we both said that we would go back
great food
we tried their vegetarian_dishes and food was really awesome
would love to go there when i am in vegas next time
we were in vegas recently and we were told by a couple of different people to try this indian buffet
supposedly the only indian buffet on the strip
it was well worth going to
nice selection and everything we tried was good
with tax it's per_person
a little secret hidden in the hawaiian_marketplace
tamba was a surprising find and the quality was outstanding
i was with a party of and we all got something different and spent the evening swapping tastes of each others dishes
i myself had
palak_paneer
and
yellow rice
the paneer was excellent and generous portions of tofu
the rice was nearly perfect but just a tad undercooked dry but worked well as a mix with the paneer wrapped up in fresh nan
the dishes and the restaurant are well presented with authentic palettes and decor
the music was subtle an unobtrusive and the waiter was superb
while this restaurant is in vegas
the prices were a little high than i'd normally expect but are a pretty good deal considering the location
good deals can be had if you check the normal coupon books
there are specific ones for tamba that could have saved us a bit
with all that said
while the food was excellent
the staff was superb
and the atmosphere was inviting
the restrooms were atrocious
i was pretty shocked considering the dining_experience to find the bathrooms somewhat trashed and unkept which worried me a little
overall i still give tamba
but please folks
take care of those frightening bathrooms and you'd easily be a
loved the food and the service so much that we ate here twice during our brief stay in vegas
it's a bit pricey
so be sure to look through your resort magazine for the off coupon
was excited_to_try this indian restaurant since it was recommended by some indian acquaintances
i love indian food
i generally don't go to the buffet lunches as they usually don't offer the best selection
everything chicken
and quality but my friend said
the buffet is actually good and they even offer lamb_curry korma
you just have to ask for it and the waiter will bring it to your table
the flavors of all the curries were fantastic and deserving of stars
the only problem is every curry was way too salty
not sure if this was intended being that it was a buffet and perhaps they want you to fill up on rice or nan
had they cut the salt in half
they would have gotten stars from me
apparently they must be doing something right because out of the whole food_court in hawaiian village
they were the only restaurant left standing
i would potentially go back again but only if i needed some extra sodium in my diet
bad food
flavorless indian food and i have almost always had better
i think survives because of the tourist crowd in vegas
i went for the lunch buffet and i found that the pakoras were without spice and a little soggy
sambar was lacking salt and tamarind
chicken was overcooked and the bread was rubber like
at
that is indeed a waste
pre pay indian buffet
ok
i was a little taken back by this
but glad i gave them the chance anyway
this buffet had the largest selection of several that i tried in vegas
including a couple southern_indian items
iddli and sambar
my water was never less than half filled
as if the server's sole mission in life was to keep my glass full
food was authentic
flavorful
and spicy for a change
i really liked tambar
every time we good back for our annual vacation in lv
a trip to tamba is planned
we always do the lunch buffet the price is good and the buffet is plentiful
we love indian food we are not indian so we know what we like
tamba has a great selection of vegetarian food with minimal meat items we are carnivores but are just as happy with meatless dishes there
each time we have gone
we have found several items on the lunch buffet that we have never tasted before so we know that they change up the buffet items regularly
their tandoori_chicken is the best i have had it is always moist and tasty
not dried_out or overcooked
they always have a paneer dish there
a soup
lots of veggie dishes like aloo_gobi
etc
they always have a dessert on the buffet and loads of hot naan
i would recommend_this_place_to_anyone who enjoys indian food or is just learning their buffet is a great way to jump in
second time to tamba
it's friggin' awesome
sarah and i first stumbled upon this charmer on our vegas trip after falling out of the luxor and walking a hangover off
deep inside the hawaiian_marketplace where even the kfc failed and shuttered it's doors lies tamba
the lone restaurant in what at one time was a glorious food_court
up the escalator and inside
you get a whiff of the buffet and hear the soft and trendy music
the perfect sound track for the inevitable food coma that the awesome buffet is about to give
loved this place so much the first time we skipped the indian spot across from our hotel and drove straight to tamba
tamba in
tamba in too i'm sure
take out food is alright
buffet is decent as well
this review is solely for the lunch buffet
tamba offers perhaps the best indian lunch buffet in town
unlike most indian_restaurants in vegas
the cooks at tamba don't focus on a bland tourist palate
and as a result
they don't produce spice less offerings
what the buffet does offer is an amazing array of vegetarian_options tasty
spicy and delicious options chana_masala
chick_pea masala
palak_paneer and various other vegetable based deliciousness
but the buffet isn't solely for the vegetable lover
the tamba buffet also carries several chicken dishes in well crafted sauces
if you've eaten at a few vegas indian_buffets
you'll know that tasty and spicy foods are rare
so if you're near the south side of the strip for lunch
you can't do much better
as for the dinner or regular dishes
not in buffet form
i haven't tried them
but several india born friends have told me that tamba is the best indian restaurant in town
rounded up to
my friend and i were really lucky to find this restaurant
since it was hidden in a deserted mall plaza
but to the point it was delicious
we decided to share
ashoka's feast
which consisted of a variety_of_dishes because it was a good deal
comes with rice
naan
dessert
multiple meat dishes
etc
it was almost true
but the portions were a tad too small for two people
we had to order extra naan in the end and used it to dip the leftovers with
everything was pretty good
but i just wish the food was bit more spicier
the servers were really friendly_and_helpful
too
i think this place really is the only indian restaurant on the strip
well
that's what they claim on their_website
overall
not bad
price comes out to around person
personally
i think i've had better
but i guess i'm not too picky about my indian food because they always taste so flavorful to me
i think if i were to come back here
i'd come for the lunch buffet
though
being one of the only indian_restaurants on the las_vegas strip
you would think that they would really take advantage of the situation and show the world how great indian food can be
instead
this restaurant is located inside a mostly vacant building
and the food they serve is very bland
the good
great selection of vegetarian_dishes
the sambar was the best item on the buffet
atmosphere in the restaurant was good
the bad
food was very bland
except for a couple of items that were good
there were only meat dishes and they were all chicken
service was ok
no one ever came by to take my drink order
fairly expensive for a lunch buffet
a person without a drink
this place was okay
but there are better places to go for dinner than here
but if you are craving_indian_food
then this is basically the only choice you have along the strip
for vegas this is definitely awesome
i went here for dinner and was very pleasantly_surprised with the dishes
i have eaten a lot of really good indian food and this wasn't going down as the best
but come on
it's vegas
if this was a restaurant in nyc it would get about stars
but in vegas it gets
the naan was ok
same goes for the raita
the dishes though were very tasty and spicy
the location is really odd
it's in the back of a crappy food_court
but it is really nice inside
the prices were awesome for vegas
and i'll definitely frequent it when i visit
i think where the rating is right now at is probably right
i also agree with a lot of other yelpers about getting the best indian buffet for your money
first
i dont expect to be amazed by a buffet
and second
i definitely dont expect to be amazed by a buffet that is so cheap
compared_to_other buffets on the strip
you get a good variety of indian food
mostly vegetarian
and its around
what is the funniest thing about this place is where it is located
it is inside a
what seems to be an abandoned food_court type building
and is the only that has been running ever since i first came here years_ago
seriously
i have never seen any other store in this food_court open
i think if you dont mind eating a little unhealthy indian food that tastes decent you should check_this_place_out
i have had their fresh food here once
and honestly this is one place where their fresh food tastes slightly better than their buffet
usually
the restaurant's fresh food tastes way better than their buffet
but i guess their food quality doesnt change much between ordering off the menu or the buffet
very flavorful and fresh indian food here
i was in vegas with my family from india last summer and we ate here
since almost all of them are vegetarian
and it was delicious
the buffet wasn't very pricey at all and had a ton of choices
both veg and non_veg
definitely a yummy place to eat
i know it looks like you are going into a deserted building on the strip but there really is a restaurant up the escalator
hubby i really enjoyed the food
that said
there were problems too
our server asked us for a spice_level and we said mild and one dish came out quite spicy
we were just too hungry to send it back
we enjoyed it despite being too hot for us wimps
the service was lacking
to put it mildly
our server was friendly enough but after being seated it took a solid minutes before anybody approached our table and to order
and during the course of the meal
more attention from the server would have been nice
if i had a do over
i would have gone for the lunch buffet which sounds like a better idea
first
this review is for dinner
the menu has a good selection of indian_fare
the mixed tandoori grill and two mixed feasts represent a good mix of indian dishes for those new to indian food
the food was excellent
i am no expert of indian food
but everyone raved_about it
my tamarind shrimp was definitely spicy
but not excessively so
the mixed tandoori grill was excellent for those who do not like spicy food
the presentation was good
especially for the mixed feasts and the grill
instead of just slopping the various dishes on the plate
each one is in a nice stainless container
the service was excellent
even though we had a large_party
we had several people who had never eaten indian food and the waiter took the time to explain the various dishes
how to eat them and various nuances of indian food
recommend
me and my mom went to dinner here tonight
it was awesome and mega yummy
food wise we got the petite veggie_samosas
which were delish
but a bit small
i got a lassi which was yummy
we also got rice and chicken_tikka_masala which was so good
i highly_recommend
we also had naan which was nothing special but good non the less
now service wise
it was great
not only was it super quick
and my water was always full
everyone was super_nice
we had the best server ever
not only was he fantastic to talk to
very attentive and so sweet
he was also incredibly cute
i would def rank him in one of my favorite waiters ever
i cant wait_to_go_back and eat their again
i rarely write negative reviews
i wanted to like this place
but the parking was difficult
the service was apathetic and blah
and the food was just
okay
our order was of course jacked up
then to cap it off
got to wait minutes for our bill
there are a lot better indian places within a few blocks of here
seek them out
i gave this two stars because the food was edible
i will_not_be_returning though
have always loved this place
but the last visits were avg
found this gem of an indian restaurant through yelp while on business in vegas
this place serves fantastic food and appears to be a locals hangout
not a tourist trap
i seriously doubt there is better indian food in vegas
this was my indian food de flowering experience
so i don't really have a lot to compare it to
i had always been hesitant to try it because the curry smelled so strong and that line from anchorman always made me cringe
it smells like a baby's diaper full of indian food
was i a ra tard
my friends invited my man and i to a birthday gathering for a co_worker and were raving about this place
the owners have come to visit us at my work on several occasions so i thought i could at least go and see what it was all about
i knew it was going to be good because it was the only business left in the building
its located inside the hawaiian_marketplace building by polo towers
and there were a ton of indian people there
always a good sign
alex was our server
he was very friendly and we left our dinner in his hands
what a smart decision
he brought out an amazing prix fixe menu i think of his own creation
nice_touch
now i will do my best to at least describe my favorites
little fried dough balls with peas and potatoes inside
served with a mint cilantro and some sort of sweet spicy glaze
tandoori sauce
chicken tandoori
great flavor
sweet spicy and bbq'd to perfection
lollipop lamb_chops with some sort of glaze with a kick
great with the mint cilantro and sweet spicy sauce mixed together
chicken_tikka_masala
holy cow
you must get this dish
the curry is mild
its creamy and a little bit of heaven in a dish
garlic_nan
garlic flat_bread which was perfect for dipping in the chicken_tikka_masala
i was so happy when we left
my man and i actually went back the following evening because i was craving it again
just as good the second time and we actually got alex as our server again
he remembered us from the night before
another nice_touch
will be back again soon
went here with of my friends for vacation
each meal was pretty cheap at each
the waiter was really nice offering to bring two bowls of rice and two baskets of bread which we didn't know costs us
add in the automatic gratuity on alcoholic beverages and you get
that was a surprise to me
the food itself was ok
nothing spectacular
i would have rather spent that money on a buffet or something else
this review is for the lunch buffet
food on the buffet was good
not great
too many vegetarian_dishes
naan was on the buffet
i prefer fresh naan brought to the table
atmosphere was depressing
tamba is in an indoor
mall
with zero other businesses
you pay before you eat which is fine if you have cash for tip
several reviews said non alcoholic drinks are included
that wasn't the case on sunday when we visited
we weren't asked if we wanted drinks until we were seated
since we already paid
we decided to stick with water
lost revenue on their part
overall
it was ok
my husband and i prefer namaste and mt
everest
as vegas locals
we will probably not return to tamba as the only draw is that we live across_the_street from it
one thing we were determined to win at
was having a great indian dinner on the las_vegas blvd after realizing that everything else out there was only
by chance luck
with a palate limited to the vegetarian_options
we hoped that their popular dishes biryani and bhindi_masala
were worth the reviews
surprisingly
they were of the finest quality and taste
we couldn't have had a more enjoyable and ful
filling
dinner
a lil too conservative approach resulted in the lunch buffet next day
hmm
we quickly realized that tamba proved to be merely just another indian buffet place for lunch
definite stop by for an exquisite indian dinner
visit them for lunch if you must have indian lunch buffet
the review is completely based off of the vegetarian_dishes
not sure how they fare at the non vegetarian menu
i was excited to discover an indian restaurant bang in the mid of the strip
but is a disappointment
they only have buffett for and no ala cart menu
the restaurant has huge seating_area but the problem is they have just one small buffett bar which makes the bar really crowded
one literally has to fight for the food
in a buffett it is advisable to have breads served fresh on the table but they had it in the bar
cold and old
any good no
they are just making money because of their location
over all good food right price however pathetic service attitude of the staff including manager there it took min for a order to come on weekday and tht too it wasn't complete until we completed the entire dinner they didn't bring the raita chutney we ordered and they tried to sneak in the items in the bill
won't recommend due to service and attitude issue
my boyfriend and i tried this place late in the afternoon and it was pretty empty
the buffet was stocked and refreshed while we ate and we had good service being seated and at the table
i found the food flavorful and enjoyed everything i tried
which was a little of everything
the restaurant was romantic and we were able to have some great conversation
i would love to come back here
where to do i begin
i was searching for a place to eat that would fit my newly discovered vegetarian diet and be acceptable for the rest of my lady friends for a night out
we walked in and were seated
immediately
of course there were only other people in the restaurant
the aroma of spices were all around and our appetites were ready to get down
we were greeted_by a gorgeous morrocan man
yay
what a way to get the night started
and soon after a philipino hottie joined in
two servers four ladies an exciting dining_experience
hakim hooked us up with suggestions on food and drinks
that would be alcohol beverages
what a delight
everything was good
except how distracted our servers would get
something went wrong with the bill
for them
i don't even remember the details
i just remember having a great time
i've been back several times now with my lady friends
we always have a good time and good eats at this place
if you like indian food and you're looking for a place on the strip
this is it
if_you're_looking for a place to hit up before a night out
this is it
if_you're_looking for an indian buffet
this is it
yes
they do a lunch buffet and the price is low
nummy nummy in our tummy tummies
an indian restaurant with some good and some mediocre dishes
we went there for the lunch buffet on a weekday
there was a decent selection of food in a nicely_decorated space
there were lots of
ethnic
types which is always a good sign
the chicken curry
tandoori_chicken and spiced cauliflower and potatoes were excellent
the naan was good and the dhaal and sambhar were actually not good
so there you have it
also there was no drink included with the meal for
which if fine
but what i found quite annoying was that you had to prepay and then if you wanted anything other than water
pay again
this did not make me happy
exc curry
tandoori_chicken
spiced veggies
good decor
ave food
poor paying policy
would i go back
probably not
i think i would try another indian restaurant first
my friend was looking for a place to fit her new diet for a girls night out on the strip
and this is what she found
i had never really been into indian food before
but not trying it and having other places
this place is pretty good
the service is good if you're a bunch of girls
haha
there are a couple of waiters that the girls lust over
so they definitely pay attention to us when we come in
the service has been delayed in that regard
but only delayed with us getting the check
i've been there for the buffet and i've ordered individual dishes
i love every dish i've had with chicken in it
i don't usually like curry to much
but i love the curry dishes here
i usually get on the spice_level as well
there are also a lamb dish that is amazing
which is best spicy
i think most things are best spicy
this is a great place to go on the strip for indian food
and if you have a large_group
they also have a back room that people seem to use quite frequently for large parties
it was closed even after they had taken reservations from us
so either their reservation system was off
opentable ed it
or they had to close for that day
boyfriend and i were in las_vegas for a small getaway
staying a little off the strip was nice
however
getting food is always a pain in the ass due to constant tourist everywhere
we decided we should try somewhere close that
preferably
wouldn't have very many tourists
bring in tamba
we made a reservation thinking the place would be jam packed
however
it was not
we_were_seated_immediately
not having to wait at all because the place wasn't crowded at all
their chicken_tikka_masala was amazingly good
this is one of my favorite dishes
so i enjoy when i go to an indian place that really makes it the way i like it
their naan was also delicious
we got the garlic_naan
as well as the alu naan
which was also very good
i'd definitely go here again if i am in the area
it is somewhat off the beaten path
i don't think the tourist have really found this gem of a restaurant
great nan and vegan_options on menu
will be back for buffet
my first time here
the sunday buffet dinner was just amazing
the idlis were so soft
they just melted in my mouth
you must try this south_indian dish to believe it
one of the best idlis i have eaten outside india
i had to take a star off because they employ kids to serve water and plates
somehow dint like the idea of that
great food
love the fact that some of it is from south_india
decor is nice
they have a really big lavish room in the back as well as a spacious dining_room and
patio
seating
service was good
their ice tea is super good
and the bathrooms are really cool
i'm a sucker for nice bathrooms
also
you can get free parking with this place
i'm sold
it is
however
in the back of a deserted strip_mall
but if you can get over that its a good place to visit
i have to say
the food made it all and the food was stellar
great amount of vegetarian choices spiced just right and with a perfect amount of kick
nothing was bland
and everything was presented beautifully
really great place
i'll stop by here again next_time_i'm_in_vegas
good lunch buffet
we tried veg biriyani it was excellent
it's right on strip
i would recommend to anyone looking for veg indian food
it's difficult_to_find restaurants that are unique and not homogenized and typical vegas style americanized offerings
we were in the mood for indian and with the help of the yelp app
found this place and quickly made a reservation through opentable
the reservation wasn't really necessary since upon arrival
there were plenty of tables available
we were seated and it took much longer than necessary for any of the servers to acknowledge us and provide menus
drinks
etc
i think this was because there was a large_party in the back room which occupied their time
this party also had a buffet setup that contained some of the most unique and appetizing indian food i had ever seen
unofortunately it was not open to people outside of their party
shucks
the food was decent and the price was ok
i was glad that we had the opportunity to not eat in another casino buffet or chain restaurant
if you like indian
check_this_place_out
we ordered the saag_paneer
malai_kofta and naan
the food was quite good and the naan just melt in_your_mouth
the decor is pretty nice too
service was attentive
the food was reasonably_priced
the only reason i did not give this place a star is because they didn't have air conditioning on and it was a hot and humid las_vegas evening
after many visits saying
gee
we should try tamba
we finally did
we visted on a sunday_night and found the place to be nearly full and almost everyone was indian always a good sign that the food is pretty authentic
they had two different
feasts
so we got one of each
both gave_us a good sampling of what tamba has to offer
since we shared
it meant just a taste of each item but all were very good
the vegetarian version of the feast started with samosas followed by saag_paneer
dal and a korma not sure of the name along with really good naan
the meat version started with an awesome tandoori_chicken followed by rogan_josh
chicken_tikka_masala and dal
all really good
service was good
i saw someone posted they did not have a c the night we went
there were no issues with temperature so that's likely just a one time issue
after reading all the reviews and not haven indian food at all on our vacation i was looking_forward to experiencing some authentic_indian_food
but even though they say they are open on thursdays when we got there they were closed
make sure you call first
the food was fantastic
my biggest disappointment was the bar
we wanted martinis
bartender said they were out of martini glasses
one drink was so bad
we had to send it back
if the drinks were as good as the food
i would give it stars
the host and waiter were super_nice and friendly
but i'm sure it's also bc they were checking us out the whole time we were there
the most horrible indian food i have eaten after coming to us
being in las_vegas does not mean that you can charge your customers a fortune for crappy food
the food tasted like the ones served in hospitals with no spices
no aroma and no flavor
everything was just boiled and served
there are plenty of other options in vegas for indian food
please skip this useless place
food is ok
limited variety
insanely expensive
i arrived at vegas and was searching for good restaurants
my friend who resides there did mention that this is an overly hyped place because of its prime location
i ignored that and did go there
there was some good side dish like raita
aloo_gobi
but i did not know with which main_course should i have it along with
do they expect me to have rice and sambar with aloo_gobi as palya
and all this after paying bucks
thanks giving dinner
and no fried_rice or biryani in the buffet spread
naan was ok
for the price i paid i could have gone else where
and be satisfied
closing comments
go here if you earned too much from gambling and do not know what to do with all that money
lunch buffet
poor tasting food
they tried to cover the taste w spiciness
would not recommend
i was a bit hesitant from the looks outside and that there was not a lot of patrons inside so i passed
but came back the night after
come to find out
the patrons are mostly indian
good sign
the food was delicious
i had the fish masala
spicy
with rice
onion naan
plus tamarind mint_chutney
everything was great
service was more 'human' than other restaurants on the strip
prices were not bad
every time i go to vegas
i get really excited because i know i'll be shoving delicious food from tamba into my gullet
most people get excited about vegas because of the debauchery they are about to partake in
yes
yes
that's all good and well done
but aside from my roulette high
tamba is why i sing viva las_vegas
go for the lunch buffet and you will see what i mean it's a vegetarian dream
there's like veggie items on the huge buffet and the naan is soooooooo good
i will warn you
it gets crazy sometimes on weekends
line out the door
raita and chutney slinging to and fro
elbowing people out of the way for the last scoop of halva
etc
but
it's worth the madness
p
s
handy dandy tip
when you are in your hotel room look for the coupon that gives you off the buffet
i randomly came across this when i flipped through the vegas magazine last time i was at caesar's palace soaking in the tub
also
if you like even more heat
they will hook you up with some extra hot_sauce
just ask
do you know how hard it is to find vegetarian food in vegas
i didnt think it would be that difficult
but turns_out all people want to eat when they gamble is crab legs and steak
after walking forever and searching endlessly on yelp
finally we found vegetarian food
they have some meat items like chicken_tikka_masala
but tons of veg options
at least in the lunch buffet
the idly are fluffy and the sambar is very good
the paneer was mostly missing in action and not very good when it was to be found
but the halwa was delicious
given that it was lunchtime
i'm shocked that this place wasnt more crowded
in fact
there were only a couple other patrons there
they are kind of tucked_away
cheapest buffet ever
it was small
but only like and had many good options
to find it just follow the signs
and they'll lead you into some weird sliding glass doors of a deserted looking building
then go up some escalators and you're there
lunch buffet here is not attracting as other indian cuisines
every time i've been to vegas i have been wanting_to_try out this restaurant
so this past weekend when i was in vegas i dragged my partner there
he had the tikka masala and i had the chicken tandoori
sharing basmati_rice and naan_bread
my meal was utter perfection
the service was adequate
we were not in any sort of hurry
my_only_complaint is that i wished the buffet option was available for dinner
i will definitely go there the next time i am in vegas
dinner prices_are_very_reasonable
it's surprising how busy it can be considering the location way back in a plaza with nothing else there
they offer a multisampler dinner which gives you small portions of or things
i got the buddah's delight which included a few vegetarian_dishes and also included rice and naan for but i didn't like everything that was offered
i would rather just have one large portion of a dish i really liked for instead
the saag_paneer was incredible
it's amazing how every restaurant does it differently
this was more pureed than others
i looked at their selection for the lunch buffet and it still looks great
look_forward to checking it out again
i recently went from mild vegetarian to full on vegan
i cook a lot at home because its not easy finding restaurants to eat at
especially in las_vegas
the steakhouse capital of the world
i decided i needed to get out for valentine's day and chose to go indian
i came across tamba's amazing website and easily made up my mind
after making the reservation i read a few revues on google and they worried me a bit
but i wasn't going to be shaken
i'm_so_glad i stayed with it
i loved this place
staff_was_very_friendly and the food was delicious
we tried the bhel_puri for an appetizer
based off of the waiters recommendation
great choice
then for entrees we went with the aloo_gobi chana_masala
both were amazing and complimented each other nicely
great for sharing
she went with a glass of house chard
which turned_out_to_be mondavi
nice
and i tried one of the many indian imported beers
hayward was the beer i went with and was perfect
gotta find that at lee's discount liquor
hope they have it
one side note
when they ask you for bread
it's not included
that was awkward
also
parking is a bit rough
over all this was probably one of the least expensive vday dinners i've ever had and also one of the most satisfying
we had a really lovely experience
the ambiance is tasteful
and our service was very friendly_and_helpful
he politely explained the items on the menu since we proved to be indian food dummies
tamba does not open until
parking can be a bit confusing
there is a lot behind mcdoanld's
there is a booth with a parking attendant
says
we told them we had a dinner reservation at tamba and he let us right in
no necessary
we tried the cheese appetizer served with spicy mint sauce
tamarind_sauce and crackers
it was really good
we had lamb_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
eggplant
types of naan
and basmati_rice
the sauces on the chicken and lamb were excellent but the meat was dry in both
the eggplant was out_of_this_world
everything had great flavor
i would_definitely_go_back and i'm recommending it to all
we spent for with all the aforementioned and large beers
worst service
the waiters did not care to check back on our table
we had to speak to the manager and they all
including the manager
were rude and arrogant
we will_never_go_back to this place again
food was just average as well
hidden on the strip
this restaurant is an absolute delight
we have eaten here many times always great experience
this place is really good
we have been here for lunch buffet
it was great
amazingly huge
we have had dinner ala_carte and it was even better
true indian restaurant food
very falvorful and they actually used real spices
very good quality
it pains me to give stars to this place when my first experience here only less than two months_ago warranted about a ish rating
my boyfriend and i came in here about an_hour before closing and instead of being greeted with a
hello
how are you this evening
spiel
we were told right off the bat to order only one entree since the kitchen was closing soon
i thought that was a bit harsh and strange as the dining_area was a little more than half full already
the kicker was a group of women that showed_up about minutes prior to closing and the same host was taking care and doting over them with open arms
guess you have to show some skin
cleavage
possibly more
to override the rules
eh
service here on the whole part is excellent
the food here is excellent and very fresh
however
i highly do recommend not to order spicy as the last dish i ordered was heavily overpowered with chili powder
but no taste
order medium
if you want a kick
but still can enjoy the flavors
portions are not big
but that is perfectly fine as they are definitely filling
the garlic_naan is good
samosas are forgettable and not worth it by_any_means
the korma is great
and i highly_recommend the yellow cumin rice as a side dish as it is superb
the other knock off is that they automatically added gratuity to the bill
it's one thing if it was a group_of_people and i understand that
but for just two people
at least have a sign at the front desk or something on the menu that says this is going to be enforced
it has nothing to do with us being cheap tippers or anything as we both vary between to on tipping
dependent on food service etc
i know the last time i went with my boyfriend and a close friend of our's
this did not occur
was it because we
inconvenienced
them by coming in an_hour before closing since the tone of the voice and body language of the host made it obvious
bizarre to say the least and this definitely did not go over well with the bf one bit
the redemption was later on when i won money on the slots at paris to cover up the dinner cost
pricey
yes
but what do you expect in vegas
for channa_masala
garbanzo beans in a sauce
is hilarious as you can go get a trader joe's frozen version of the same thing taste for around and change
expect_to_pay at least nearly a person to give you a gauge of what to expect
unfortunately
this last experience did not go over well at all
especially with my boyfriend
we won't be coming_back and we'll look for another indian food restaurant avenue that will hopefully show more class to its customers when we visit vegas again
bad food
buffet is for and my statement had a charge of
my friend had the same charge
food was cold and not indian
tucked_away in a quiet part of the hawaiian_marketplace
this little gem is a perfect spot to escape the hustle and bustle of the strip
just steps from the actual strip
the lunch buffet offers a great value and authentic indian_fare
requested pander tikki_masala per other yelp user
excellent dish
solid service
only complaint is they charge for rice
i hate that
it was a great restaurant
it was decently priced and excellent food
the decor was inviting
this place is legit
hidden in a strip_mall and filled with indian clientele
went in for buffet night and was so happy
got to try everything from goat_curry
delicious and tender
to chicken marsala
well worth it
the buffet was big with many choices for everyone
bar service needs a little help but hey
i should have just ordered beer and not a vodka tonic
will be back
this place is an exotic gem hidden inside the crappiness that is the hawaiian_marketplace
walking through this rundown strip_mall and into a mysteriously empty building and up the escalator
i did not expect to find a beautiful atmosphere of indian decor
i really regret ordering take out instead of staying to dine in but my friends and i all picked_up food from various places and we wanted to eat together
i was immediately greeted_by a gentleman who gave me helpful suggestions on all of their vegan friendly items
this made ordering very easy for me
while there were several options
i decided on the following
kali dal
slow cooked black lentils and spices
http
su
pr wv z
veggie_samosas
about or pieces
http
su
pr wadc
tandoori roti whole_wheat flat_bread
basmati_rice
one sad thing about take out is that the presentation is not as elegant
however
it smelled good
it tasted good
and i was happy
my friends were definitely peering over at my food
i even gave away one of my tasty veggie_samosas
for the that i paid
i had a full vegan meal plus enough leftovers for a second meal which tasted just as good two evenings later
my boyfriend and i were starving and didn't want to walk very far from mgm for dinner
we found this place on yelp and were skeptical about the place since the location was quite hidden and not many people were dining in
anyway
we were there last_night
it was our first time to have indian_cuisine
so we absolutely didn't know what to order
our server was very welcoming
friendly
and very informative
he made very good recommendations for our entrees which was called karahi chicken
it was awesome
it had the right amount of spice and had such a great thick blend of curry with onions tomatoes
peppers
and cilantro
served with garlic flavored nan
i ordered the ashoka's feast which consisted a taste of india's most popular dishes and that was amazing
so to sum it up
great service from our waiter
great food because my boyfriend was very happy at the end of dinner
even though he was feeling down when he lost gambling
lol
had dinner here with my fiance when we were in vegas
the food was excellent
we ordered kurkari bhindi
mutter_paneer
garlic_naan and rice
everything was excellent
the bhindi was spicy and tasted great
the paneer was rich and went well with the garlic_naan and rice
the only reason i'll dock a star from this place is because of the service
although initially
we didn't
have any issues with being seated and all
the service slowed down throughout the night
it ended with a long wait for the bill after we were done and my drink never really being filled up during dinner
i will_definitely_go_back another time though
and if the service improves next time i'll easily give this place a full stars
this is a hidden_gem on the las_vegas strip
it's not in a casino
you can't see it from the strip
it's tucked_away behind the hawaiian_marketplace
and it is totally_worth the journey to get there
i think one way to judge quality and authenticity of a restaurant is by the clientele
there were many people of indian descent here
and that made us even more excited for our feast
and what a feast it was
i had ashoka's feast which included and appetizer and then four small dishes and rice
it also included naan
and this was the first time i had ever been to an indian restaurant where i did not have to order more naan
they served plenty
the lamb roganjosh was prepared with a perfect blend_of_spices
the chicken masala also prepared just to taste
everything was very flavorful and though try described it as spicey
nothing was too spicey
this meal also included a donuthole dessert with a sweet caramel sauce
they were able to accommodate our large_party
on relatively short notice for a saturday_night
if you're in the mood for indian food while on the strip
check out tamba
the staff was extraordinarily attentive and professional
best indian buffet i've had in my life and i'm not exaggerating
the dishes that should be spicy were actually spicey
very affordable and although the building looks a little rundown on the outside
it's nice and clean on the inside
the hostess was friendly
too
only thing that could've been better was the naan
it wasn't crispy at all
but what do you expect unless it's made to order
parking sucks here
so try not to drive
once you get over that
then you have to find it
it's upstairs in the hawaiian_marketplace
they have a lunch buffet for which is dang good
usual suspects on this buffet and probably like total choices of things to eat
i've also eaten here for dinner w an indian client of mine
and when you eat there for lunch you will see indians eating there too
great sign in my book
i love their indian techno music
they have a very nice motif
it's very clean
and the staff is on it
you can be in and out of here
minus parking
at lunch time in mins if you needed to be
only buffet for dinner tonight but still busy at opening time
great service
very friendly and accommodating
took our coupon for off two entrees even though we couldn't order_off_the_menu
food was excellent
we took the advice of several yelpers and parked at planet hollywood where we enjoyed happy_hour and then walked to the hawaiian_marketplace
i'd love to go back to tamba
legit spot for hangover brunch
if you can wake up early enough for it
i'm very critical of indian_restaurants but this lunch buffet hits the spot like a triple chilled
quintuple distilled
boutique vodka
service is hit_or_miss but the food makes_up_for_it
if you're jonesing for different edible fare in vegas in between the buffets and the subway in that crappy casino on the strip
this is a solid choice to soak up your alcohol indiscretions
if you shoot fire out of your bunghole the next day
it might be tamba
then again
it might be the result of table service at marquee
who knows
awesome indian buffet
went there for late dinner
pm ish and it was still packed with people
were indians
it is always a good thing when you see natives having a meal at their restaurant
most of the meat dishes were spicy but tasty
like their selections of dishes
salad
fried veggie
flat_bread
some curry sauces
lamb goat_curry
chicken
good price too
look for their coupon at the vegas guidebook ask your hotel
even though it is a little hard_to_find upstairs in the hawaiian_marketplace
this place is totally amazing once you get there
we go to vegas about twice a year and we always make a point of going to tamba's lunch buffet during our trip
if you like indian food this place is amazing
the food is fresh and delicious
the ambiance inside is super_nice and the service is great
not to mention the price is so good for all the wonderful food they offer
this is second time i visited tamba while on trip to strip
again same absolutely fine taste of indian cousin
probable i would return again to this restaurant to taste it's all items
stars for the mango_lassi
i liked the juice
yogurt ratio
there is more juice so the consistency isn't too rich and thick
it's easy to sip through the straw and afterwards it doesn't feel like you ate a liquid dessert
stars
we shared the ashoka's feast which was good but not great
in my opinion
the spices were a bit muted
i like indian food that is tantalizing and i love it when i taste new combination of spices
but
ashoka's feast didn't do that for me
i'd definitely come back and try other entrees
overall
stars
this spot is definitely a good eatery if you're in vegas and on a budget
the service is great and the ambience is warm and soothing
as for it's location
it is in the middle of strip so it's not too hard to get there
just walk over
break a little sweat
and stuff your face with some good food
excellent food
just check to make sure they are still serving your favorite things
i was very disappointed that they didn't have the two items that were the sole reasons i came back to this place and brought a friend
papad and gajar halva
the food is still very good so i would rate it high
it's my fault i didn't check to see if they still had my favorite items
also if you get to the marketplace after
you won't have to pay and call to make sure that they will actually open at
because today they opened later
ish
still food worth waiting for but
may have been able to save money on parking and just gone later
you_will_not_be_disappointed
a must go for everyone
i was relaly looking_forward to this place but was disappointed upon arrival to find out that they are only serving a buffet
the spice_level on the buffet was low
i did enjoy the variety of food but would have preferred to have ordered off the menu
order the chicken_korma it is to die for
garlic or plain_naan with yellow or basmati_rice and you are set
tamba has to be the nicest indian restaurant i've_ever_eaten in
the interior is extremely well done
just had to be said
anyway
the food is one of the best i've sampled in the city
quality is high
flavors are pretty authentic
and the selection is great
prices are high like most indian_restaurants
the lunch buffet is one of the best as well
selection is diverse and the flavors are not watered_down for mass production
pricing is a little higher_than usual
but it is on the strip after all
it's also somewhat hard_to_find if you've never been there
dinner is their strong suit
if_you're_looking for indian food and don't mind paying a little for a great experience this is your spot
doesn't get worst than this bland indian dinner buffet
ok customer_service
pretty expensive for the quality of buffet but that is probably because it is vegas
i was excited to know about the presence of an indian restaurant right on the strip
and we were happy to shell out bucks
including tax
for a dinner buffet for two of us
which is highest that i have paid for an indian buffet
the experience turned_out_to_be just okay
the quality of food was not bad
in fact
the naan and gulab_jamun
dessert
were excellent
and most of the other items
except idlis and sambhar were also okay
not great
idlis were certainly stale by at least a day
i have more problem with the variety aspect of the buffet
i have seen more variety in buffets
the number of vegetarian entrees especially was limited
how can any indian buffet be complete without a single paneer entree
and really
zucchini as an entree in an indian buffet
o also
i would expect more starters than just pakodas and at least
a complimentary chai in a buffet
chai was
and wasn't good
next time
if you are on the strip and you crave for indian food
take the deuce to indian masala
you can thank me by a
useful
vote here later
looking for someplace to eat around pm and stumbled across tamba
looked it up on yelp
and decided to check it out based_on the reviews
it wasn't crowded at that hour
but there was a steady stream of customers
many of them india
food was great lots of great choices at the buffet
filled my plate before getting to the meats
at first was dismayed
because i didn't want to waste food
but i put away the first round in no time and headed back for the vindaloo i missed the first time through
yum
not sure when i'll get back to vegas
but if i do
tamba will see me again for sure
note
i'm not an indian food expert
we don't have many indian_restaurants in hawaii
but what i tastes at tamba i really enjoyed
from a gori
this restaurant changed my mind about indian food
i'd tried indian twice before and hated it
my bf
who is from mumbai
persuaded me to give his nationality's dishes one more shot
most people go to indian_buffets
a cheaper and pretty good option
but i went initially to a normal meal
i loved it
the butter_chicken melted in my mouth and i was ravenous after the chutneys
i'm converted
i love indian food now thanks to tamba
note
although technically on the strip
it is isolated from the crowds and meets a steady stream of repeat customers
i must say
the variety at this indian buffet was impressive
also food was good and fresh
butter_chicken was really tasty
i'm not too sure what is going on here
i looked at this restaurant's yelp profile and it lists their hours
pm for the lunch buffet after getting back from vegas
according to the profile they are supposed to reopen at
we went here around
not knowing what their hours were and they were of course closed
on the business hours listed on their door there was no mention that they reopen at
otherwise we would have held off and waited
in a city that never sleeps it makes sense that they have the hours posted on yelp and not what we saw on the door when we tried to go in and dine there
tamba
indian restaurant on the strip
authentic and it has spacious dining_area
we had been there for lunch buffet and to my surprise i had to pay the bill before you kick off your lunch
there are not too many items when compared_to_other indian_buffets
idly's
too hard and totally disappointed
most of the indian's hesitate to eat idly's which are not soft
it's my personal comment
we had pakoda and tandoori_chicken which are fine and i would expect to have more starters
chicken curry was the best among the buffet and also tasted couple of vegi curries chole
chick_peas
and dal
little expensive for such kind of food
it's las_vegas and won't comment about the cost
totally it was not a great indian buffet
easily my fave indian in the valley
great location w surprisingly convenient parking
for the strip
best buffet of its kind in town
very nicely remodeled dining_area restrooms a few yrs back
we found this place one day when we were walking along the strip and i was not feeling well
i have hypoglycemia and had not eaten in several hours
we had been wondering around the hawian marketplace and i was feeling so bad i was not sure what i was doing
we went in the building which sadly is deserted on the first floor and one of the employees directed us upstairs
he could see i was ill and got the manager who immediately got us a table
once i had been seated and started getting back to normal we ordered
i had the butter_chicken which was amazing and my bf had the curried goat
our waiter was shocked he asked for the goat and had to make sure they still had some but came back smiling and letting us know it was still available
he said it was fantastic
our waiter was attentive and kept a positive attitude even though and indian couple behind us ordered several things and kept sending them back unhappy he never lost patience with anyone
it was a great meal and we would go back
at the time one of the half price outlets had coupons to reduce the price
we also ate here on christmas day for the lunch buffet and while it was good none of the entrees were marked and even a few indian customers questioned what the dishes were
i was not nearly as impressed with the buffet
i enjoyed the lunch buffet
famished after a flight
pretty tasty
but leaning to the spicy side
a couple of chicken dishes including a nice tikka masala and good tandoori
no lamb
goat
or tofu
no beverages other than water were offered
i like the one i frequent in laurel md a lot better
had a vegetarian dinner buffet but did not like anything neither starters nor main_course
best lunch in town
fresh food
well cooked curries and melting appetizers
the place is perfect blend of ambience and awesome food
have visited it many times and still looking_forward to more visits
wait times are awful and the service is horrendous
food was mediocre at best
best indian restaurant on the vegas strip
very good indian buffet
buffet is worth_every_penny
ambience is amazing
food is subpar and highly priced because it's located on the strip
tried the lunch buffet
it was pretty good and had a decent number of dishes
dessert could_have_been_better
the ambience is amazing and service is great too
best indian food on vegas strip and the employees are pretty friendly
must visit
the food was delicious
the service was not
i'm not sure if our asian
perhaps philipino
waiter did not have strong english but he would not take my order to switch the paneer for veggies
i asked if the paneer in my dish could be substituted for veggies and he kept trying to convince me to get a completely different dish
it was very frustrating i've never dealt with that before
finally i became extremely irritated and told_him to go ask because that's all i wanted
sure enough i got what i asked for which restaurants are usually very accommodating about so i figured he was just a bad waiter
the little gem hidden inside the thriving vegas strip
the buffet the previous night not only disappointed us but was high on meat
so we decided to try the indian place out for lunch buffet
keeping in mind our friend's recommendation
the spread was apt
with veg dishes having an upper hand
delicious
warm decor and excellent service
if you are having that sudden craving for desi food in the middle of the strip
look nowhere else
food was amazing and service was great
i got a thali dinner
off the menu
the thail is a sampling of differnt dishes
i got a vegetatian thali option which came with somosas and nana
however
i gave them my gluten_free card explaining my dietary restrictions and they made some great adjustments giving me some other great veggie_options and replace my fried carrot dessert with mango_ice_cream
husband ordered a chicken thali plate and love it
i will be back for more
before posting
went back a second time with friends
be warned items on the menu do not come with rice or nana
it was about for rice
for nana
order the thali plate instead
it came with the rice and nana
food was still great second time around
we visited tamba during our vegas trip and it has the best indian place on the strip
the price is reasonable
food was fresh and tasty
service was great too
mediocre
we paid bucks per_person for a dinner buffet that was acceptable for a
lunch
staff was fine
taste and quality very underwhelming
i usually eat so much at an indian buffet that i am near exploding
but not this time
i tried it all
how does this restaurant have
stars
the food was mediocre at best
and there really was no service
so i can't even write anything about it
the pakodas were downright pathetic
the navrattan korma was drowning in an unappetizing cream_sauce
the naan came out of a freezer i'm sure
the saag was the worst i've ever had
the dal was ok
but that's because it is almost impossible to screw up a dal
i did like the raita though
the dessert was probably for diabetics
honestly
if there wasn't a sign there that said it was kheer
i wouldn't have known
seriously
it needed much more sugar
some cardamom
saffron
nuts and needed to be made by someone who knows what kheer is
now comes the funny part
they make you pay before you even sit_down
what is this
a restaurant or a school cafeteria
our glasses were refilled only once and our dirty plates were never cleared
needless_to_say
i did not leave a tip
good food
we tried there dal and baigan bharatha it was very good
panner was ok
i am not big_fan of paneer anyways
i will go back here if i am in town
no cocktails on menu
great taste on tamba indian reastorant food was amazing and service was very good i been there last month find this place to on yelp he always help
i go there to dinner with my family it s amazing love his food
spicley butter_chicken was so great so many itam on buffett plan naan great and sweet res malaie very very great taste customer_service was so nice
if i go next time in vegas deffinatly i go tamba again
love his food
great
worst food
they don't know how to make dal tadka
mutter_paneer infact not even masala papad
they should realize idli is not whiskey
the older the better
we had great food and service from anand
he had great recommendations and was thoughtful about the timing of everything
we ordered a chicken_tikka korma and the aloo_gobi
both were delicious and one of them was off the menu
the tamarind_sauce was great
ambiance was good the entrance to the mall is off putting but once inside its very comfortable
best indian buffet i had in sequence of indian_buffets the long weekend n monday
parking is nightmare
unless some had a better idea
went herewith my friends and had the lunch buffet
very limited choices
only chicken and vegetarian
naan was crispy
not much more to say
don't let the location distract you
this is a real gem
we had the chicken_tikka_masala and the butter_chicken both were great
the mango_lassi was very tasty too
i would strongly recommend you leave the standard food on the strip and enjoy this place
middle of the grade food
went there with a large_group for the lunch buffet
watch out
the strip_mall where they reside is actually a ghost town with this the only establishment that's viable
but once you get past that
the food is a solid
b grade
stay_away_from their tandoori_chicken or the
paalak paneer
gravy dish
my friends had a
difficult afternoon
shall we say mildly after the meal
they also refused to split the bill amongst the of us who wanted to pay separately on our credit cards
the person serving us
suggested
that we charge it on one card and deal with splitting the bill ourselves in a not very polite way
place is convenient on the strip and price was person
mostly catered towards vegeterian but the food was alright for the price and location
service was quick and efficient and the allowed us to linger for a bit while we talked and took our time with our food
disappointed they didn't have any dessert at the buffet
not a big_fan of eating indian food while travelling as i get enough of it in bay_area
but this being a common popular place in the middle of the strip i thought i will give it a try
the knowledgeable people i asked eho have good indian food reviewing skills all told me this place is extraordinarily ordinary
its usp is it's location
they were all right
our friends were feeling indian
so we came here to this indian restaurant
this is located in the hawaiian_marketplace between the mgm and planet hollywood filled with many vendors and eateries so it may be hard_to_find
going inside the building where this restaurant is located was kind of creepy because it was super empty
however
going inside the restaurant
we saw multiple patrons enjoying their food and the atmosphere proved to be very cool and modern
i shared an order of malai_kofta and chicken_tikka_masala with my bf
because we were hungry but not super hungry
hahaha what does that mean i don't get myself
anyways both items were really good
my boyfriend and i gobbled both of them up
portions were pretty big compared_to_other indian_restaurants i've been to
also their bowls are pretty cool
they were shaped like a spoon
you have to see it
i can't really explain the weird shape right now
but need to be handled to great care as you can easily spill whatever item on your pants
like my boyfriend on his favorite khakis
rip favorite khakis
waiters here were pretty friendly
cool
and funny
what i liked was that they kept filling up my water
it's like they know me
they know i need to quench my thirst
overall
a good time having indian food here in vegas
i definitely would come here again for some indian food
enjoy
worst indian food ever tasted
price
is too high taking full advantage of strips
if you really want to eat don't go for indian food on strips
better to try something else
nice and tasty food
reasonably_priced
great location
upscale ambience
good service
worth the visit
everything about this place is excellent
i happen to love indian food
i eat it all the time and this is some of the best i have ever had
i had the chicken_korma and it was superb
pricing was spot on for the quality
actually i would have gladly paid more
i gave the friendly waiter a nice tip instead
the environment was also quiet
modern
clean
and welcoming with nice soft lighting and interesting art work that really sets the mood
it is a great retreat from the hustle and bustle of the strip
the service was also excellent
the staff were friendly_and_attentive and always had smiles on their faces
the food also came very quickly
i also have to give them props on their choice of bowls used for serving rice and curry
they use bowls with a slant cut opening which makes it really easy to pour serve from without making a mess
they also had very clean
modern and orderly restrooms which is an absolute must for a fine_dining location
a establishment
d
friendly and quick service
admittedly very early in their dinner hours so near empty
good food
not the best but no complaints
especially the naan
nice_atmosphere inside
and reasonable_prices for vegas
i went to this place while hiding from some weirdo who was chasing me down the vegas strip
this place has lovely decor and a nice ambience
the buffet is
with tax
but there's not too much to choose from and they only serve water
great flavor better than what i had at a more expensive buffet
but i would have liked to see more variety and something to drink other than water
pleasant staff
great food
really like the ambience and food
sambar was excellent
must try indian food if you are on strip
tucked_away on the strip in the hawaiian_marketplace area
this is a hidden_gem
so i'll admit it was my first time having indian food
luckily i was meeting friends who had some knowledge about it and helped me out on what to have
we went 'family style' so we were able to taste a little bit of everything we ordered
first i want to say the service and staff here were amazing
my_water_glass never went less than half full
kudos
our waiter was very helpful also in helping us decide what to get
i would say he went above and beyond
to start off
we tried the vegetable samosa's and vegetable pakora's
the samosa's reminded_me_of an empanada except stuffed with potato and peas
accompanied with the sauces
these were great
the pakora's were good also but a little too much breading
for the main_course
we went with the chicken_tikka_masala
the tomato curry_sauce over the chicken was good
i scooped this over the basmati_rice and was very pleased
as for the chicken and rice dishes
there was plenty to be shared between people and couldn't imagine eating this all myself
we even had much leftover
the garlic_naan came out warm
flavorful and perfect
overall i was delighted for this to be my first indian food experience
my hunny and i always make sure to eat here on get away day
good buffet and nice clean restaurant
in five years we haven't missed a visit here yet on our annual vegas trip
this place was a godsend for a hungry vegan
i had the lunch buffet and was delighted
highly_recommend to any vegan visiting the strip and looking for a real meal
excellent food
samosa_chaat and aloo_tikki were some of the best ones i have had so far in america
the food overall was excellent
i'm really glad i decided to come here
first i was skeptical because the place was completely empty
not a single soul was here
however
a lot of people showed_up once we were sitted
highly_recommend to any one
tamba is located in a run down shopping_center and a little hard_to_find but once you do
it's soooooo worth it
we had the lunch buffet and were blown_away by the number of vegetarian_dishes
the southern_indian items were less than desirable but the saag
dal
naan
etc
all were excellent
friendly
attentive staff too
indian food on the strip
yaya
it was like visiting lil india on the strip
we reached here when it was
pm
yes they were even letting in people when it was pm
the food was just ok
not spicy to my indian taste_buds
but yes you can ask them to make it spicy
delicious indian food with great service and good ambiance
on the strip too
samosa_chaat was good
we also had aloo_gobi and paneer_tikka_masala
will visit again next time we're in vegas
awesome food service
everything we tried was extremely tasty
great selection of food items as well
i will absolutely be back again
wish i had known about it sooner
my absolute favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
hands_down
try the tandoori fish
palak_paneer and butter_chicken
to die for
i am staying at a hotel off strip and so i tried two off strip indian_restaurants and tamba on the strip
all for lunch buffet
food at tamba was hands_down the best
even though the most expensive
but not by much
all vegetarian_dishes were very flavorful
decor also improved from years_ago when i last visted them
it was also the only restaurant of the three where i saw indian customers
for what is worth
this place is excellent in many ways
husband went exploring the strip while i of course slept in
he discovered tamba and brought me their card knowing that i love indian food
we walked from the mgm at about
which is a pretty weird scene
the mall is empty except for this restaurant
the restaurant was about full with more than of the people eating there indian or pakistani
we ordered on basmati_rice
naans
began bharta and matter_paneer
all excellent
literally the best roast eggplant curry i have ever had
they roast the eggplant in their tandoori oven which adds a smoky flavor
the texture and heat were just right
paneer was perfectly made
the portions are more than twice the size of what i normally get here in san_francisco bay_area
pricing a bit higher
but it is vegas and
a dish is not unreasonable
waiter and hostess and bus staff were all very nice and efficient
once you find this place in an old shopping centre
it's well worth it
service was great
it was quiet
meals were lovely
butter_chicken a little different from the aussie butter_chicken but still nice
meals were large as i ordered a number to share but there was so much left over
very nice
love_this_place
so cute
so modern
food portions are huge
can't_wait_to_go_back
butter_chicken is delicious
a hidden oasis
all i wanted after walking endlessly up and down the strip was to find a reasonably_priced restaurant that was quiet
this was it
strangely placed on the second level of a nearly empty strip_mall along the strip
you might not know it was there
beautiful inside with soft indian music_playing
this was a place i could forget that i was in las_vegas and enjoy delicious curry
i shared the goat_curry with my husband since the serving size easily serves reasonable appetites along with rice and naan
the naan_bread was delicious
the curry had a nice light spice and was probably a bit too salty
but i still loved it
the lime ginger soda was unexpectedly tasty too
i could see going back here a few more times if i were stuck here longer
the waitstaff was attentive too
though there weren't many diners
okay
this isn't a place i would typically give stars
but it was just what i needed at the time
one request draft beer would be a good addition to the menu
we loved tamba
we love indian food and are vegetarian
but don't have an indian restaurant in our town
so when we travel we usually go indian
we've been out in paris
london
san_francisco and tamba was as good as all our favorites
we'd never had samosas chaat which was exquisite
samosas with special toppings
we have two boys
and
and all four of us were trying to plan how to go back when we could on our stay here
we had dinner one night
ordered off menu
and buffet two days later for lunch both times it was awesome
lunch is less expensive of course
we tried several new dishes in the buffet and we all loved everything
we lamented our shows all started at pm and they didn't open until pm for dinner
but we found a way to get there for lunch
the service was outstanding a super classy place tucked_away in an odd little location
well worth searching it out
my friends and i were walking down the strip really hungry and we had no_idea_what to get until we saw tamba
the restaurant is kind of hidden in a shopping_center
but i'm glad we found it
great service and great food
i got the buttered chicken with rice and garlic pita_bread soo good
this place is amazing
food is great and good value too
if_you_are_looking for comforting food with cozy setting
its far from busy street
navratan korma was great and nan was much better than other places
i was pleasantly_surprised by tamba indian restaurant in las_vegas
being indian
i feel like i am slightly harsher than the average individual when it comes to judging indian food
tamba is situated conveniently near the middle mid south area of the strip
the restaurant was clean and had a very pleasant ambiance that is a fusion of modern and traditional elements
the staff was very friendly_and_attentive to us during our meal
the buffet itself was quite good
there was a variety of options for vegetarians and non vegetarians
the food quality was surprisingly good and there were a number of healthy options
the buffet was pretty reasonably_priced for las_vegas about person including tax
tamba is definitely one of the better indian_buffets that i have been to and i look_forward to returning
we went on a sunday and they were only doing a buffet
that turned out really well
since i wanted to try different things and not be stuck with a single entr_e
the food was excellent
and flavorful
the wait_staff was on their toes
someone was right there to pick_up the plate when we were done with it and refilled water the minute you put the empty glass down
looking_forward to going again soon
very customer friendly and generally good people
but one of our guests threw up an_hour after eating here
won't be coming_back
but i wish them the best
not a good experience
food is too oily
very less non vegetarian_options
no taste what so ever in any of our food
we ordered different kinds of
shaak
n all of them tasteless
even the customer_service was bad
we had to ask for water or time
no one even come to ask how was the food
very disappointed
call before you go for dinner to see if they actually serving
dinner
i arrived for dinner to be told that it was only a buffet
the wait_staff was unsure 'when' or 'if' it will ever return to a regular menu for dinner
the buffet table was too short for the number of people seated in the restaurant
the line was almost out the front door to get food
as for the food mediocre
food seems to lose its quality when plopped into a gallon pan
the nan_bread was dry and some of it was burnt
hopefully the food would be much better served as a dinner
when i am with a group_of_people
they always prefer to pick tamba for indian food
can't complain
good indian food will put you in a good mood
very mediocre indian food
naans were cold
currys that these_guys serve are cheapest and most commonly available in all indian_restaurants
for this you will be paying ridiculously high price
please improve your food and menu
this was decent indian food
it was especially welcoming in las_vegas where it seems like you pay out the nose for mediocre food
so they would get
we ordered a sampler platter
garlic_naan
chicken tandoori and fish masala
the chicken and garlic_naan were very nice
the platter was also tasty for a group appetizer
ask for kumar he's a sarcastic waiter who may make you laugh
check in and you may get a off food coupon for lunch or dinner
the decor is also quite nice
very calm dinner environment
it also had several indian families as customers
which seemed like a great sign to me
we ordered a bottle of cabernet wine and it was about per_person not bad for the strip
we went here last week for a friend's going away party
it is a small
southern_indian vegetarian restaurant just north of the on scottsdale rd
the dosas for appetizers were tasty and very filling
and the entree
gobi_manchurian
was amazing i never thought cauliflower could taste so good
we also had the bhatura bread
which was a large
light bread that could easily be shared between people
the food is also served family_style
so it is easy to try multiple things and share with others
as a vegetarian
i can't think of the last time i had so many choices
we_will_definitely_be_back
update
i have relocated to the bay_area and still haven't had indian food this good in san_francisco or berkeley
damn
pierre's review of the health code violations brought this from a five to a one
ick ick ick ick ick
southern style indian food all vegetarian and vegan
after having a few games of buckhunt at the stray cat
and perhaps a pitcher of miller high life
i won't front
my companion and i decided we were hungry
not wanting to resort to four peaks in tempe for food
he suggested green restaurant finally
a flexatarian
def
someone who enjoys not eating meat at every meal and understands that a person may not eat meat and still like food
who understood my lactose intolerance wasn't just to be difficult
so we stopped by green
and they are closed on sundays
damn
we drive down scottsdale road
saddened by the rainy sunday_night
and he spots this indian restaurant
i pictures creamy paneers and chickeny kormas
uh uh folks
all vegetarian and vegan
we are welcomed warmly to a full house and realize quickly we are the only white people there
score
i order us the appetizer sampler which is huge
i mean
it had four sauces
the cilantro
coconut
tamarind
and some kind of chutney
pakoras
samosas
lentils
etc
we ended_up cutting them all in half and taking them home
i had the dosai with potatos
onions
chutney
peas and spices and loved it
i love tamarind_sauce and i think the staff was please i did cause they give me a shitload
he ordered a kind of dosai with cheese in it and it tasted yummy
but eerily like an enchilda
i also convinced him to indulge in the mango_lassi
god
i miss those dairy yogurty drinks
and it was tasty not that sweet and maybe a bit yogurty than necessary
but really cooled down the mouth when had too much of the spicy chutney
the bathroom was nice
the staff was great
the decor was simply
all the indian families were happy
i was happy
he was happy
and i had about vegan items to choose from
why the hell did i wait so long to go here
please check it out
i have dreams about the potato onion pancakes here
i love udupi
all vegetarian and a healthy understanding of 'vegan'
the helpful waitstaff carefully made sure i didn't eat the wrong sauce when dining with friends
their pancakes are huge
actually much bigger than the filling inside
and there is a large selection of food to choose from
the food was ok
buffet style
what really left a bad taste in my mouth was
a
having my complete credit_card number left on the receipt
b
getting hit with a phone call charge to my credit_card
when i called my bank to investigate
it turns_out somebody had charged a phone call from london to india on my credit_card
c
it turns_out it was somebody from this restaurant
stay_away_from this shady place
there are plenty of other honest indian food businesses in the metro phoenix area
delicious lunch buffet with great naan and vegetarian
sometimes vegan
dishes
you definitely won't miss meat
their dosai are wonderful
with or without the masala filling
dunk them in some tomato chutney for some spicy nummyness
i've had their_lunch_buffet here for months and it only rarely gets old
they often serve cauliflower dishes for lunch
but they're accompanied_by at least other dishes for you to choose from
i have yet to visit here for dinner
sadly
the food is so good
the menu is huge so i always get the sample platter thing because i can never decide on one thing
or
i go there at lunch time to get the buffet
the buffet is always different every time i go
and
its vegetarian_vegan
so its always an option for the veg heads
i love_this_place despite the violations that it received last year
i heard about it from a friend who lived in india for awhile and she said
eh
it makes it more authentic
and seriously
what restaurant in phoenix doesn't have roaches
as long as i don't see them while i'm dining i don't care
and
it's still open
so i assume that they have rectified the situation
if you like south_indian this is the place
for those of you who are worried about the bad health dept rating from last year they fixed their problems and have had all inspections rated gold or silver since then
most recent
sg udupi_cafe n scottsdale rd tempe e d seating silver
from
http
www
maricopa
gov environmental services website
the lunch buffet is great delicious south_indian vegetarian cuisine
dinner is fantastic
too
one of the best south_indian places i have been to including in nyc and california
fiancee unit who has been to tamil nadu state in india says the food is very authentic
i love reading others reviews about my favorite restaurants
regardless of the nasty health reports which have since been taken_care_of
this is the best southern_indian food have ever had
the lunch buffet is always good
there is this cauliflower dish on the menu that is so friggin good
i wish i could remember_the_name
everything i have put in my mouth here as been worth telling about
if you don't need meat at every meal like most americans think they do then try it
i love it when i go into any ethnic restaurant and see more people of that particular ethnicity than your run of the mill american
to me it is a good sign of an authentic food experience
i'm going to marry the gobi_manchurian
kids will follow
this food is so good it would throw my principles to the ground
but it's all vegetarian and most of the menu is vegan
thank you udupi for your wonderful oily menu
yeah
it's not super healthy
but amazing anyway
this is my_favorite_indian_restaurant anywhere
last summer i was in the pittsburgh area visiting a friend_of_mine that is from india
he took me to what he said was the best and most authentic_indian_food in the country
udupi is better
the environment leaves much to be desired
but the food is amazing
a must have is the paper dosai masala
it's a huge crispy crepe that has a filling
the masala has a potato filling
and it comes with sambar and chutney to dip it in
the presentation is as wonderful as the flavor
as evidence
the last time i ordered it
the tables on either side of us asked what it was
the pricing could be a little cheaper at dinner
i have yet to make it to the lunch buffet so i'm not sure how it compares
all in all
if_you're_looking for great indian food
this is the place to be
i thought this place would be shut down by the health department by now
this used to be my_favorite_indian_restaurant
no matter if it's vegetarian
until it had a string of health inspections and violations that threatened to close its doors almost every two months last year
seriously
i thought it was hanging by a fingernail a few months_ago
but judging from the recent dated reviews
it's still open
i don't know if i should celebrate or be a little worried
i try to check restaurants' stats by using maricopa
gov's link
and i couldn't get myself to dine there a_few_weeks_ago as udupi still does not have a good report
but then again
most of the indian places i like didn't either
only royal taj consistently gets golds
i do love the dosas here
simply the best resto for dosa
the gobi_manchurian is quite a dish
love the app sampler
their palak_paneer is the best i've had in the valley
this could easily be my favorite of all indian venues
but the owners cooks seriously need to heed health inspection reports
and so do the customers
come on now
how hard is it to take the time to wash your hands before you continue preparing food after you come in from dumping trash in the garbage bin
we consumers can help keep these restaurants efficient and their kitchens clean
which translates to our digestive systems uncompromised
by voting with our wallets
as soon as udupi gets a great health report
i will be back to enjoy its menu
before i go into details about today's experience at udupi
i want to attest that the food i had tasted wonderful
my friend and i agreed to meet for lunch
i was the first to arrive by at least ten_minutes
this gave me ample time to survey the buffet and ask the host questions concerning my food allergies
however
before i started with the allergy questions
i inquired if the buffet came with dosa
the host said yes
we would later find out
during check out
that
buffet dosa
cost an additional
so
the correct answer would be no
after all of my questions had been answered
i concluded that only the white basmati_rice
bread
plain paratha and iddly
four of six chutneys
homemade papadum
and dessert
homemade cottage_cheese balls
think non fried gulab_jamun
soaked in sweetened coconut milk sprinkled with crushed pistachios and other spices
were allergen free
i'm not much of a
chips and dips
person
unless spinach
artichoke
garlic
and cheese and a few whole_wheat crostini are involved
so my prospects concerning the buffet looked pretty grim
while attempting to place a phone call and i wondering out loud if i should have my friend meet me elsewhere
i spied a dish containing one dosa sitting on my table
the host overheard my asking my friend if he was going to have the buffet
yes
that was his intention
and i then asked the host that rather i have my friend meet me elsewhere
which meant that the dosa would have to be thrown away
could he have the buffet and dosa
and i could order something off the menu
yes was the answer
before i even looked at the menu
i ordered the palak_paneer with rice
he quickly turned in my order
and i proceeded to take a couple of bites of the now cooled dosa
the host suddenly did a and returned to my table to tell me that i couldn't share my friend's buffet or else he would have to charge me for another buffet
i said that i was only having the cold dosa
which he would have to throw away had i decided to leave
and he said that it was against restaurant policy for two people to share the buffet
i said i understood
that i wasn't intending to share my friend's buffet entree
but that i was only having the cold dosa which my friend would probably prefer to be hot and fresh
i made a mental note not to come back here anymore
or at least
not to come back anytime soon
i also thought i should have gone with the idea of going somewhere_else
friend finally arrived
grabbed some buffet items
and sat_down to eat
it took about minutes for my palak_paneer
spinach
homemade cottage_cheese cubes
onions
spices
and coconut curry
entree to arrive
but the wait was definitely worth it the spinach leaves had a beautiful dark green color to it and weren't at all mushy
the cubes of cheese were meaty on the outside and creamy on the inside
and the onions
cubed chilies
and spinach stems and other spices perfected the masterpiece
i can eat this over rice or stuff it into dosa or pita_bread and be blissful
it's good to know that the food served here is delectable
it must be said
however
that other than the news that the venue has been under new management for over a year now
i would not have been able to surmise anything had changed at all invariant furniture and decor
consistent and scrumptious food
same cooks in place
and familiar faces among the staff
even the same hosts manning the door and register
i wish the new management sustained success
i have had udupi bookmarked for about three months and i cannot believe it took me this long to make it over here
especially since it is less than seven minutes from my apartment
i had dinner plans with an out of town friend and he mentioned being in the mood for indian
the stars aligned and we ended_up here
i started out with a hot black tea and mixed vegetable_pakora as our appetizer
the deep_fried potatoes and veggies came with two awesome sauces
one reminded_me_of a sauce with a little sweet tang
the waiter was extremely friendly and did not take offense to our slaughtering of the names of the menu_items
he even made a bread suggestion and explained what each of the sauces were made of
we opted to go with the batura bread
which happens to be a giant deep_fried poof of bread that tastes like a sopapilla
it actually looked like a giant jellyfish when it came to the table
as an entree we went with my personal fav
mutter_paneer
which was excellent
and udupi special spring dosai
basically thin crepe chutney spring roll type things
they were good
but not great
our food came out quickly
the service was attentive
the prices were reasonable and i was really impressed with the taste
portions and quality of our dishes
i will be back to udupi for sure
this place is amazing
wicked tasty
friendly service
i really appreciate knowing that there is absolutely zero chance of finding meat in my food
as this is a fully vegetarian restaurant
some stuff does have dairy in it
but the menu is full of vegan dishes and makes it pretty clear
the chana batura is my current favorite
chick_peas and giant puffy bread
i absolutely love_this_place
first of all
i am not a fan of buffets
usually you get a selection of questionable choices over cooked slop
udupi_cafe does the traditional_indian buffet lunch perfectly
at least on weekends holidays
the week day lunch is a little disappointing
not in quality but in variety
the weekend holiday lunch buffet is full of variety
being vegetarian
its nice to have a buffet full of tasty options without worry
the majority of dishes are vegan clearly marked
everything is tasty well seasoned
you wont find any tandoori options here
so no naan
but
the dosa is absolutely_delicious don't hesitate to ask for more
i have even witnessed a foot long dosa being served to a family
so bring your
friends maybe get lucky
this was my first experience with indian food
as a side note
i would recommend that you don't try something completely new for the first time by yourself
that's what i did so i was the single guy in the corner looking at everyone watching what they took from the buffet
how they ate it
etc
they thought i was weird
the restaurant itself was nice good parking right up front
i got there right at noon and it wasn't busy
the hostess was very friendly and the staff prompt and friendly
as for the food
i can't really tell you what i had
but it was good
i had a soup
and tried a little of each of the dishes on the buffet
they brought out something and sat on the table
it was a crispy thing with something inside
i watched for others to eat theirs and joined in
it was pretty good
i would_definitely_go_back
but hopefully with someone that knows something about the food
great buffet
although it was a little on the salty side
i'll be going back there the first chance i get
which unfortunately won't be soon enough as i live in oregon
everything was so yummy
and all vegetarian
a surprise to my father who naively asked for lamb
he was very satisfied
nonetheless
in the end
udupi_cafe is my new favorite indian restaurant in phoenix
wonderful spices
intense flavor spectrum
and genuine homemade flavor will satisfy any eater
carnivore or vegan
i dined with a group of friends late on a friday_evening
opting for adventure
most of us ordered blindly from the extensive all vegetarian menu
selecting whatever
sounded good
there are tons of vegan_options as well
i ordered palek paneer
my indian food barometer
it was spicy
fresh
and filled with cubes of paneer
the house specialty vegetable manchurian are meatball sized chunks of crispy deliciousness dripping with sweet chili sauce
they reminded_me_of a spicy crispy honey chicken
but vegan
the dosai
crepes
my friends ordered were huge flavorful pockets filled with spicy veggies
the light pillows of paratha
bread
reminded_me_of sopapillas
chili pakora appetizers were insanely delicious
an indian pepper popper
a definite
gotta try it
for any fan of spicy
fantastic service
water glasses were kept full
waiters were attentive
and the food was served piping_hot and quickly
even for our large_party
i will_definitely_return to satisfy my new craving for palek paneer vegetable manchurian
and to try something new
okay
so i love_this_place too
indian food is possibly my favorite cuisine
i was in tempe for a few days
and my vegetarian self always struggles out on the highway
seeking the best experiences i can have
and always fearful of going hungry
well
at
pm friday_night
i accidented upon this place
in a goofy strip_mall next to a motel
and nervously asked if it was too late to dine since they were closing at pm
the owner was very welcoming and seated us promptly
the place was a bland sun drenched pink walled space with a buffet at the back wall
i didn't have much hope at all
but when our palak_paneer and our bharwan baigan curry showed_up
the salivating began
perfectly prepared
the eggplant was absolutely delectable
the spinach and cheese also very delicious
i couldn't beleive it
this was a definite rival to my fave indian kitchen back home
i loved it
we had some leftovers
but no rice to go with it
so the owner gave_us free rice so we could have our curries for breakfast in the a
m
a definite must if you like true indian vegetarian food
tempe has it's indian going on
udupi is by_far_the_best_indian food in town
it is all vegetarian and has many vegan_options that are scrumptious
my favorite night out involves chili gobi
breaded cauliflower in spicy red sauce
and chana batura
saucy chick_peas with giant puffy bread
so so good
their buffet is good too but i prefer going for dinner
udupi is one of the best indian_restaurants that i've ever been to
and i've been to a lot
the gobi_manchurian
noted by several prior reviewers
and the chole peshwari are to die for
i also recommend their sunday brunch even though it costs more than ordering off their menu
the only downside to udupi is that it received some bad press for the cleanliness of their kitchen and dining_room
i must admit that i saw a cockroach once at udupi but
this was a year_ago and they seem to have cleaned up their act
nonetheless
the food is amazing
well priced
and offers a welcome treat to a veggie lover's tummy
thanks to an episode of
roker on the road
i had a craving for dosa
after a day of going back and forth of
udupi_cafe or taj_mahal
i decided on giving udupi_cafe another try
after poring over the dosa menu
i finally decided on the udupi special spring dosa
a version i haven't tried here before
i asked my servers if the dosa and the chutneys were free of certain allergenic ingredients and was told
with authority i might add
that the dosa was ok and while two of three chutneys
coconut and jalapeno cilantro
were off limits
the sambar is good to go
he even pointed_out an allergen ingredient in the coconut_chutney
the a ok signal on the sambar surprised me greatly
as out of the three choices
it was the first item i'd have balked at trying
i've tried it at many other restaurants and was told that the recipe calls for a few allergens
my server did offer to bring tamarind_sauce to replace the other two chutneys
since i was almost salivating at the sight of the dosa and the server was pretty confident in his knowledge of chutney ingredients
i dove my spoon into the sambar and came up with a lovely and flavorful chunk of potato and a bit of broth
yum
i went in again
this time swirling a bit to make sure there weren't any allergens hiding in the murky depths when i spotted
as if on cue
my server and the host approach my table to tell me that i should not eat the sambar nor the dosa since they contained allergens
argh
so
away went my udupi special spring dosa
away went the sambar
and i was back to square one as to what to order
although this time i knew i had a few hours of pain and nausea to look_forward to
which started to rear their ugly heads as i was signing my credit_card receipt
at this point
the host was steering me away from the dosa menu since i'd have to stay_away_from all that contained any filling
apparently
the kitchen staff could not whip up a filling that omitted the one ingredient that kept me from having it
under normal circumstances
this wouldn't be such a terrible thing as there are many other dosa options that would then be complemented with chutneys
but since the three chutneys also contained an ingredient i couldn't have
again
the chef would not be able to make the sauces omitting the ingredient the host explained that the chutneys were made in huge batches earlier in the day
dosa from udupi_cafe is off limits for me
i decided
then
to have the assorted appetizer platter
this would've only been accompanied_by tamarind_sauce had i not asked for a second option
plain yogurt
as suggested by the host
plain yogurt
i asked
could you add something else to flavor the yogurt
carrots
is carrots ok
the host posited
yes
carrots are alright
i said
the three items i savored in the app platter were cauliflower pakora
the samosa
and the veggie cutlet
i wasn't a fan of the dense mysore bonda
various fillings of potato
eggplant
and jalapeno
nor the bready medhu vada
fried lentil donuts
although the latter was quite good dipped in tamarind_sauce and yogurt
in retrospect
i did not particularly revel in the recurring reminders of how everything was deep_fried
in light of the disinclination of udupi_cafe to omit certain ingredients in their dishes which leads me to believe that most items are already pre made and later plated
if you read my other reviews
you'll see just how many chefs are quite willing to swap out sub sauces
sometimes piqued at the chance to come up with a new sauce on the fly
and the the reluctance in creating a simple chutney
i doubt i'll keep uc at the top of my choices next time i have a taste for indian_cuisine
so many fish in the sea
i wish uc and its management and staff well in providing vegetarians and omnivores alike the opportunity to enjoy a menu offering up veggie fare
do try the gobi_manchurian very tasty
at least the meal wasn't a total loss i did get to capture some captivating eye candy
how i wish i had a close up on that veggie cutlet
and that samosa
one of the best restaurants for southern indian_fare in phoenix with a traditional
sit_down dining atmosphere
good lunch buffet
especially on weekends with more options to choose from
service is inconsistent
sometimes they're understaffed
cleanliness has been a concern at this place in the past
and even now the restrooms are still to be avoided
i read_the_reviews here at yelp agree with most of you
this is one of the best south_indian restaurants outside india
the buffet is great
not greasy like a lot of other indian_restaurants
typical taste of south_india
i saw some reviews about the place being unhygeinic
it is as clean as it gets
it's possible it was not so clean earlier
the service was pretty decent
considering there was only one person serving
they could hire couple of waiters to make the service better
my family really enjoyed it
my son was apprehensive with it being completely vegetarian
but even he ate heartily
it was a nice mother's day buffet
i went on a wednesay with a collegue visitng from india that was craving hojmetown food
little selection and way to salty
some dishes were tasy and i appreciate the all veginess
but was dissapointed
udupi saved my dupa
i had to have an event catered and the place i planned on using could not accomodate our time
i needed food at noon
they didn't open till pm
shame on me for not checking
but hey we live in a big city
never thought about it
i frantically went to yelp to find an alternate
all of the food needed to be vegetarian
i'm not vegetarian
had no clue where to get good food and fast
found great reviews_on_yelp so i gave udupi a try
one phone call and they had an entire catered buffet menu worked out
in my price range
they were completely accommodating and the food was fantastic
i asked them for mild spice and that's exactly what we got
everyone raved_about the food
the special house curry was especially tasty
i will be back and can't_wait_to_try other dishes
i will never know what the food tastes like because they were so so rude
i will not go back
we came in and were given a table
menus were practically thrown at us
and then we waited
and waited and waited
we asked a woman working there
and she apparently did not speak english and indicated a man at the front would help us
but he was too busy talking
we got up and left
no one even said a word when we left
so
i have been giving vegetarianism a shot the past couple weeks
pescetarian may be a better word
but that is neither here nor there
i was invited to join amber w's vegeversary on friday_night and this was the spot she picked
i will admit
i was a little scared by the veggie vegan only at an indian place
being the good yelper i am i decided a new place to review would be enough of a draw
kidding amber
i arrived a little late and the table had already ordered
but the server came by with a menu and i
along with my brother and a friend
were able to order rather quickly
the table had ordered some apps of cauliflower manchurian and batura
which is a large puffy bread
the cauliflower was great and the bread reminded_me_of the skin goldmember eats in the austin powers movie
but it tasted great
my brother and i ordered the vegetables manchurian and the onion and hot chili uthappam
the veggies were mashed together into a ball and then sauteed
very good with a little bit of a kick to them
the uthappam was a giant pancake with onions and other spices
it was really good and i could have eaten the whole thing myself
it reminded_me_of a potato latke
we shared other dishes at the table with everyone_else
there was a pretty wide_variety of dishes
some kind of spinach
a dish with peas and paneer
awesome
btw
and couple of others that i wouldn't begin to find on the menu without help
rice is brought out with all of the dishes and it was cooked_perfectly
we divied up the bill and it was very affordable for the amount of food we all got to eat
the place will not be a staple on my regular rotation
but if someone says that is where we are meeting for dinner
there won't be any hesitation going back
minus one star for the sub arctic temps where i was sitting
udupi used to be better a couple of years_ago
i'm pretty sure ownership changed and it is not as good any more
i agree with the other user that the lunch buffet does not seem fresh and often cold during peak lunch hour
the bread is fresh and hot and service is good as well
i haven't tried many items or the lunch buffet yet
but from whatever i've had here
i would say its a decent option for indian food
being a vegetarian
its a nice thing to know that there is no chance of meat ending up in my food
vegetarian_vegan south_indian buffet
guilt free conscience
what more could a girl want
i am in love with the dosas
i always wish i had a larger tummy to accommodate all the delicious food
udupi is proof that being vegan vegetarian can be tasty and cruelty free
humble ambiance
no fancy decorations
although i am not a vegan vegetarian
i really enjoyed udupi_cafe
having the sampler plate and appetizers including iddly
it was definitely unlike any food i've ever had
with a stress on mixing varieties of different flavors and textures
hoping to make it to southern india sometime in the next couple years and udupi has given me another reason to look_forward to it
ok so it's star since i can't go any lower
one of the worst indian food experiences i have had in the us
the service would was horrible and the owner just downright rude
i went there for a lunch with a couple of friends and was informed rather rudely that they only have a buffet for lunch
this was disappointing since i had my heart set on certain traditional dishes some of which were part of the buffet already
the owner couldn't seem to care less whether we stayed or left and pretty much seemed to give us an ultimatum to either eat the buffet or leave
it being late we decided to try the buffet was sub par
barely an item i could think of going back for
in short avoid it if you can
the service makes its not worth it
so here's the deal
i love indian food
i grew_up with easy access to some great examples of it growing up
partly due to my friends' parents
but since_moving to arizona a few years back
it's been difficult finding good places for some indian_cuisine
a few months back
i was driving down scottsdale road and a sign caught my eye
vegetarian
i later discovered that it was an indian restaurant that was held in pretty high regard from a few of my friends and i knew that i had to give it go
i've now been to udupi_cafe for lunch a few times
pretty much the only thing that i would change would be it's location to central phoenix so i could eat there more often
udupi's lunch buffet is awesome
especially for less than
it has a good selection of flavorful dishes
most of which are actually vegan
the usual favorites are in attendance
a variety of chutneys
dhal
paratha
etc
as well as a few dishes that are a little more particular to udupi
the lemon_rice is great
in addition to the selections at the buffet
you are also served an amazing curried potato filled dosa with your meal
for those of you unfamiliar with dosai
they are the indian equivalent of a french crepe that's made from rice
not that i'm one of them
but they're also great for people that are trying to be gluten_free
the filling aside
which is tasty though nothing super special
the actual dosa crepe at udupi is one the best that i've ever had in phoenix or elsewhere
awesome texture and flavor
although i can only comment on their_lunch_buffet
i would imagine that the rest of their food would only be better
bottom_line
a great place for indian food in the phoenix metro area
the best that i've had so far
i found udupi in the strangest way
i was talking with my friend from ne mesa
and she told me i was right next to her favorite indian restaurant
i thought it was ironic that i have been driving by it for a couple months and thought it was part of the laundry mat
little did i know
it was a little piece of food heaven
the atmosphere is less than desirable
but the food is fantastic
the entire menu is vegetarian and i cannot recommend one thing
because it is all excellent
they do not serve alcohol
but you can bring_your_own bottle and they don't make you pay a cork fee
i recommend going with a group
this allows you to order multiple items and try them family_style
it's so hard doing vegetarian and dining out in arizona
of this i'm sure
we've been to udupi a few times over the past few months
and taken my mother when she was visiting and my sister for her birthday
i was nervous the first time from reading a bad review
here plus
it's in kind of a not appetizing location
that said
everything was great
service is gracious and professional
the atmosphere is a tad 'old denny's' but the other diners are usually a cross section of people that you could probably be stuck on an island with and no one would eat you
random i know
but this one time we were there and this cool young couple had a baby and friends at their table and you could just tell they were all very loving people
sorry for the woo woo
the place smells good
and the food is fresh and authentic
i love the paper masala_dosai and now i'm craving one before am
love love love
this place is a vegan indian food lover's dream come true
it is almost totally vegan with only a couple of exceptions the desserts are never vegan
but it's genuine south_indian
so what can you do
the food here is amazing
amazing
the lunch buffet has such a great variety and everything tastes good
i wish they had even more dosa varieties than they do
when you drive by
it doesn't_look_like much
ignore that
looks are definitely deceiving in this case
udupi is one of our very favorite restaurants
best indian food ever
i lived in nyc for a while and couldn't find anything quite as good as udupi
great prices
hubby and i can get out of there for under bill
the aloo_gobi is perfect and i love their assorted appetizer platter
fried goodness
the staff_is_very_friendly
i've done the lunch buffet
too
which is fun and great for mixing it up if you find yourself ordering the same thing every time
only
took a group of work friends
even some hardcore meat_eaters
and everyone left happy and full
went here for lunch
it was a good place
but there is no meat
so if that what you are looking for
you should go elsewhere
i gave it an a ok
wasn't my favorite place
but it wasn't bad
lots of spicy food
so be careful
i'm sure i will be feeling it later tonight
the help was very attentive and they continued to fill your water_glass
which is great
because my mouth is still a little bit on fire
i walked in and it was much smaller than i expected it to be
the buffet wasn't too much to look at but man the food is freakin bomb
they were even passing out free little fresh extras
honestly the dude that said this was spicy is a wimp
cause i barely felt any kinda fire in my mouth
i left full and happy
thumbs_up
ill be back
note they had vegan dessert when i was there
being south_indian myself
i really really want to see south_indian restaurants succeed in the valley
and being a life long vegetarian i really want to see such restaurants continue
this was my first time at udupi
and can honestly say i went in with high expectations
and left wanting never to go back
we got there at
and i asked the host
if it was too late to enjoy the buffet and if we should order from the menu or take the buffet he insisted the buffet would be wonderful
i mentioned that this was our first time here and asked if there was anything special we should try
he said the buffet is wonderful and that while they close the buffet at
we should feel free to enjoy our lunch after
everything looked appetizing so we loaded our plates and sat_down
the waiter brought out two dosa's for us and everything had the makings of a good lunch
big problem
sadly
the food was cold
even the dosa they supposedly freshly_made was cold not just the crepe on the outside
which would naturally cool quickly
but the filling inside as well
i mentioned the cold food to the waiter and he actually grinned and walked away
maybe he didn't hear me
who knows
big problem
our host didn't tell us that it wasn't just the buffet that closed at
but the restaurant itself
our waiter actually changed his clothes and left without even telling us
i looked around for him
and the host came over and asked us
what are you searching for
and i mentioned our waiter and he goes
oh he went home
we are closed right now
we are all just waiting for you so we can also go
so of course
we dropped our forks mid bite got up and left per_person
when i mentioned the cold food
the host said that the food is cold because they turned off their food warmers over half an_hour ago
um
thanks for the heads up
you know
i could forgive the gaps in service if the food was stellar
but it was eh
with the exception of the spinach kootu dish with was delicious
i went up to the condiment bar and when i moved a ladle a bunch of fruit flies came out of the salad area yuck
why would anyone with any amount of self respect serve a guest food they new was cold sub par and then hurry them out of there
if he had just said hey we close completely in mins
please join us for dinner i absolutely would have come back
greedy greedy greedy
i sincerely hope my experience is an isolated incident
but i'll never go back
not will i ever suggest them to anyone
this place is for your vegetarian_vegan i suppose fans out there
food is made fresh
very tasty and spicy to boot
their gulab jamen is amazing
that's pretty much all i gotta say about that
their dosa was good but the potato filling was plain
all in all its solid
i'm not a south_indian
but a north_indian
but i know south_indian food
as i have lived in south of india for some time
anyways we have been going to udupi
since last years
we used to love it soo much that we went there every week
but then the owner's changed and over a period of time
the quality of food has deteriorated
the sambhar became thinner and thinner
the idlis are dry
and overall the buffet is just the same stuff again and again
you cant really go there everytime to eat the same things
the staff is really good
one guy whos been waiting tables there from a long time
recognizes us and is very polite and prompt in his service
i found this place on yelp
and went there for the lunch buffet
having read_the_reviews
i had really high expectations of the place
but was sorely disappointed
watery sambar and rasam
hard idlis
dosas with a miserly amount of potato stuffing
gulab jamuns that tasted nothing like gulab jamuns
inattentive and too few waiters
and disgustingly dirty bathrooms in my opinion
udupi_cafe missed the mark completely
their a la_carte menu_items might be better
but i am not going back to find out
the cheese dosai is essentially india's vegetarian philly cheesesteak
this alone makes the trip worthwhile
but is not the end
the curries are also excellent and flavorful
the lentil doughnuts are a great appetizer
light and puffy
the only con is that one is inclined to overdo oneself at the buffet
which isn't even really that much of a con
another mediocre indian restaurant
mediocre food
mediocre service at mediocre prices
some days can be less than mediocre
if you're craving some specific dish
and your drew lots for this
i guess it's okay
i am not sure anyone would choose to go here
meh
i love indian_cuisine and this place is awesome because everything is vegan or vegetarian
a friend and i walked in and ordered to go
it was pretty busy and the menu offered a wide_variety
i didn't recognize the names of the dishes so the host helped to explain the dishes and that there were different regions of indian_cuisine
we ordered
vegetable_samosas mmmmmm so yummy
stuffed with potatoes
onions
and peas
i liked it dunked in the yogurt_sauce
poori indian bread
this was good with the chutney but it was a little crispy for me since i'm used to eating naan
mango_chutney sweet and spicy
huge chunks of mango
vegetable_curry the flavor was perfect
spicy but not too spicy
lots of veggies
extra rice
overall
it was pretty good
i think that it was a little pricey for the amount of food you get
i would go back to try the lunch buffet since you get to try a variety of things for a better price
a dedicated meat_eater
interestingly enough i have found this to be some of the better indian_cuisine in the valley
i am still trying places
i knew going in that this was an all vegeterian location and on this day
the buffet greeted me with all vegan delights
while initially missing my indian favorites with chicken
paneer
lamb or goat
i quickly pushed those ideas out of my mind and begin to enjoy the wonderful flavors of the various and different dishes
i made sure to try a little of everything
halfway through a masala_dosa was delivered to my table
fresh and crispy on the outside with a curry potato filling on the inside
this was very good
full but craving something sweet at that point i was missing the kheer or mango pudding often available at your typical indian buffet
lunch buffet and water to drink was almost
hummm i felt a bit over charged
but paid my bill and went on my merry way
to start with
i tried 'idli'
with chutney and sambar
the idli was way off course and actually didnt taste like one
the chutney probably had coconut
as compared to coconut that i have come across many udupi cafe's across us
and the sambhar
absolutely pathetic
moving to main_course
all the curries were highly reduced and were not that delectable
i am keeping this review short and sweet because you cant write much about how pathetic food was for the price that i paid
i am never going back to this place any time in my life
this is my nd time at udupi_cafe
and i waited to write a review until a nd visit to be sure
the service here is lackluster
our waiter actually told us that
he only works here
and has no input into the chefs cooking when we asked him if we could not have all the vegetables in the mixed pakora platter
seriously
the food is mediocre
the pakoras are dry and tasteless
we had chile pakoras and there was no spice or creativity to them
the dosa itself is good
the potatoes are very mushy and have minimal taste and their chutneys are not the best quality
i would recommend spending more time on working on their food preparation and less time on the wait_staff telling us that nothing can be changed
as a indian
i would recommend jewel of the crown over this cafe in an instant
this is my favorite place to get indian food for dinner
i could say that i've tried many things
but that was a long time ago now my friends and i just order chili gobi
breaded cauliflower in a spicy tomato sauce
chana batura
chickpeas with a huge piece of puffy bread
and usually the aloo_gobi
potatoes and cauliflower in a yellow curry_sauce
you will not miss the meat dishes i mean it
i have also been to the buffet here many times and it is not my favorite indian buffet
i find that the food buffet items can be hit_or_miss
go for dinner and you_will_not_be_disappointed
as a vegetarian
it is sometimes hard_to_find delicious and flavorful food when going out
udupi's vegetarian lunch buffet is am az ing
i have yet to try anything there that i didn't like
and i am a very picky eater
i've never been for dinner
but i have done the lunch buffet many times now
they always have new dishes to try and everything always tastes incredible
the staff is always attentive
and even suggested a spicy soup to clear up my cold one day
even my boyfriend
who is a serious meat_eater
bugs me to go there all the time
i will definitely go there whenever in the mood for some great indian food
i was in a rush
but wasn't in the mood for fast_food
saw this place and decided to try it out
i walked in and its a buffet setup
i asked if i can do a to go and how much
man says yes and
i said sure set me up
hands me a styrofoam container
and i asked him i can put whatever i want
he said yes
went to the line
and what a disappointment
the only thing that looked appetizing was vegetable_biryani and idli
so i put a little bit of rice and took idlis
plates only half full
i asked if they would bring out some more idli
they said yes
shortly they brought out some more to restock the buffet
i grabbed more
now my plate is full
and i am on my way right
wrong
the manager or owner stops me and says i'm sorry but i'm going to have to charge you extra for the idlis
i'm baffled
he explains that buffet takeout is for a variety only and not just one thing
i'm baffled
i ask him so if i dine in
and i take a plate of only one thing and maybe the second time i get the same thing you would charge me twice
he says no
that's dine in though
i'm baffled at the logic here
so i went along and says what are you going to charge me
he says
i'm baffled for plate of vegetarian food
i can understand a premium steak but rice cakes
idlis
unreal
i was tempted to just leave the plate there and show him the bird
but i already commited to already
and i was in a hurry and starving
so i bit the bullet and paid more
never again will i give this place my business
and the food wasn't even that good
it's rice cakes for god sake
my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in the valley
great food
lots to choose from and the staff is very nice and helpful if you don't know what to get
they have sampler type orders that allow you to try many things
they also have a fantastic lunch buffet with a wide_variety
everything is very reasonably_priced and did i mention it's byob
we stop and grab a pack of our favorite brew and come here for some gooooood grub
it is vegetarian but honestly
even if you're not one
you won' miss the meat here
so much food and it is all soooo good
you don't need the meat
this is by and far my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in the phoenix metropolitan area
they have the most delicious palak_paneer and i love their peas paratha
i have never had a bad experience here and routinely order their food for take out
the staff is polite and attentive and the prices_are_reasonable
if you want to drink housefly go here
yes it is true
i liked the onion dosa and the tamarind rice and this server refilled my glass_of_water and i was busy reading something and about half glass_of_water inside me
i saw a big housefly died and floating in the water
man
the owner billed me and went to him and talked about housefly
he wasn't apologetic in the beginning and handed me a coupon for next time
i told
sorry i don't think i will ever come again
after eating here once
i was very unsure how i felt about udupi
food was pretty good
atmosphere nonexistent
and service was
shy
i typically do not dock stars for the last two characteristics if the food is good
so i knew i had to give it a second chance before making up my mind
i'm very glad i did
because i had a terrific experience
not terrific enough to give it more stars but enough to commit to being a returning customer
the vegan_options are terrific
every dish i've eaten has had that
comfort_food
quality i personally look for in indian_cuisine
i've tried a couple_of_times to engage the servers in providing a recommendation
but they were hesistant to elaborate with any dinner advice
which is ok
i can make up my mind without regretting my choice
and our server host this last time was extremely friendly and accommodating
when i entered at pm there was only one other soul dipping some dosa in raita
it made me a little nervous to see the lack of customers
by the time i left at
the place was full
a very good
reassuring sign
for having been vegan in az for years
i'm surprised i haven't been here more often
i was a little put off by the plain set up and lack of personality upon my first visit
but i am decidedly over it
i don't really eat indian food
but this place has me converted
i went to their_lunch_buffet and they had the most interesting things lined up
everything was at least vegetarian except one item
and they had a delicious rice_pudding for dessert
this is where the indians eat
well
recently we were like out of choices so we went there for dinner
but i assure you this was our last visit to this place
the dosas were horrible
nothing had any flavor to it
idlis were dry
and it was soo hot inside
their ac was not working
really
in az heat you do not care enough to repair the ac
the nice waiter switched on a table fan for us that rotated between us and other tables across from us
i would rather sit at home with my cool ac and cook my great indian food on my own and make it much much better than they do
ok what people say about service
ambiance and all that is right
but the staff is friendly and they fill up the water diligently during the lunch buffet
and they get stars
the food is delicious
i've been at least times basically every sunday i am in arizona
consistently great vegetarian buffet
i was overall happy with the food
we ordered the appetizer platter to try various things
and the only thing i didn't like was a hard round patty thing that was really dry
the variety of dips were great
i had the malai_kofta
veggie cheese balls deep_fried
in a yummy yellow sauce
and it was awesome
hubby had palak_paneer
cheese spinach sauce
and i found it bland but he said it was ok
paratha stuffed with garlic was ok
the garlic was bitter
i've found garlic is bitter when it's gone too old so i assume that's what happened
service was weird
place was empty when we got there and the first person to the table laughed when i said we'd order the appetizers while we look at the menu
which is just odd
there were about different people coming to the table so i don't know who our actual waiter was
but the only person that smiled and seemed friendly was the man who brought the food to the table
the rest were quiet and sort of like mannequins that moved
nothing was bad though
except for maybe the fly that kept landing on things
when we left
one of the employees
who was missing teeth and looked like a meth head
was begging the host manager person to stop payment on his paycheck because he didn't use the account anymore
he said he owed money in the account
so if the check deposited
the bank would take the money
i thought this in really bad taste
i really don't want to know
great buffet
good food and nice people
i eat here a couple times a week
check in on foursquare for off
the best indian in arizona
maybe in the country
im a chef and im very picky with restaurants
i am always impressed when go there
decent selection of vegetarian indian_fare
but the price per head is a bit staggering
it isn't terrible
especially if you're a vegetarian
or vegan as they have some vegan dishes
and want to comfortably be able to eat without worrying about meat
the selection isn't expansive and the place isn't necessarily upscale
but the service is good
it's good to try at least once
especially if you love indian food and want to try a different side of it free of goat or chicken
food wise
you've got your typical variations of dals and lentils in different cream sauces
your basmati_rice
and your dessert table of milk cake and rice_pudding
i'm sorry there isn't much of anything else to say
some other places i'd recommend over udupi for typical
delicious
and cheaper indian food would have to be jewel of the crown in old town scottsdale and delhi palace on asu campus
the cafe seems to be closed for good
somebody from the nearby business came out and told us the place stopped operating a week ago
if you find yourself in tempe arizona and wanting indian food
go here
best i've had in some time
great tambla music
too
highlights for me were tomato chutney and mattar_paneer
lots of desserts but i was too full
you gotta love_this_place for what it is
vegetarian_vegan with tons of spices and flavor
yeah
you can tell the veggies are frozen sometimes or not the highest quality
but the flavors and great cooking make all the difference
beware the sat sun lunch_buffets are a little more money
open again
really missed while it was closed the last few months
one of my favorite places
great lunch buffet for vegans
good south_indian food
went for saturday buffet lunch
will_definitely_go_back
weekday lunch buffet
i'll admit that as a meatie i'm a tough customer to impress at these veggie buffets
but madras ananda bhavan managed to pull it off
so did cafe_krishna
yesterday
by comparison i thought udupi caf here was weak
this is a mid sized restaurant with a simple but ok decor
there are tables only
no booths
which would have been my preference
the host was friendly but the smell of incense burning was sure to interfere with the taste of the food
it did
over at the serving tables
there were food items plus sauces dressings
i was also brought an ok tasting masada dosa with curried potatoes
offered another one during my meal
the next issue was that the sambar soup was barely warm
most everything else that should have been hot was not up to temperature either
if they're worried about people burning their fingers on the little stainless steel bowls
replace them with china or melmac ones
duh
the rasam soup was better
there was salad as well as some puffy chips something like the ones the mexican kids sell from tricycle carts around town
they were labeled papadum
but they weren't that
the dall curry was pretty good but mostly everything was just
there
neither particularly good nor bad
most of the dishes overall were labeled properly as far as i know
vegan recipes were identified
sorry udupi fans
for me this one was a bit of a dud
weekday lunch buffet recently reduced to
closed tuesday
one of my favorite places to get indian food
i'm vegan so i love that there is so much to choose from
my all time favorite is the chili gobi and vegetable manchurian
i'm_so_glad udupi reopened
i usually come here on the weekends for the buffet
a little pricey
but i think the quality is excellent
i'm not indian
and i grew_up in the midwest
so i won't comment too much
service was just ok
but the food worth a repeat for me
it's hard_to_find quality vegetarian restaurants_in_the_valley
let alone all vegetarian eateries at all
so thank gosh for udupi caf
a tasty tempe spot that just so happens to be less than a mile away from the all vegan green
udupi serves a wide_variety of indian food that
unless you're familiar with the type of cuisine
will require some translation help when ordering
be warned
the portions here are huge
which rocks
considering the dirt cheap prices
i got the sambar vada
which are fried lentil donuts you can dip in a spicy sauce
i also got paneer_pakora
fried_cheese
and poori
big
fluffy bread
go here for the food
the ambiance is simple
and the tables aren't exactly the comfiest
the service is also lacking
last_night
like many times
i waited more than minutes for a soda refill
but udupi hits the spot for a satisfying
healthy
ethnic meal
the best indian food in the valley
i've only been here for takeout a few times
but the staff is really friendly
i've been looking for a place that makes good dosas and was so happy to find udupi
so happy they cater to vegetarians
the thiruneiveli spinach dosai is amazing
i can't_wait_to_try some other things
excellent food lunch buffet
we find the food to be top quality some of the best indian food we've eaten anywhere
we find most of the items to be vegan on the buffet and the variety to be excellent
if you are not a vegetarian_vegan
don't let that steer you away
the food is seasoned so well tasty
i think most people would be more than satisfied with their meal
service is friendly prompt and the value can't be beat
for those who eat at the buffet
each person also is served a generous dosa
filled with a potato like filling
that is delicious
highly_recommended
i went to udupi for dinner last_night for the first time
we had about people and the service was great
the food came out quickly and it tasted great
the staff is super friendly and the selection of vegan dishes is amazing
this is going on my regular rotation of restaurants
i live close to this place
used to come several times every week
shared a dish with my husband and still very filling
their owner changed about month ago
kitchen staff remain the same
year_old carpet is replaced with tile and the decor looks fresher
i was and still am a fan of this place
their authentic food deserve applause
very good lunch buffet
all vegetarian
a tasty buffet that serves vegetarian and vegan dishes
udupi offers a great variety of curries
starches
and desserts that will please anyone that doesn't need to have meat at every meal
for me
usually i enjoy the veggie dishes at indian_restaurants more than the meaty ones anyways
so i didn't mind not eating meat for my lunch
we went on a sunday_afternoon
and found a mix of various northern and southern_indian dishes
some buffet items included vadai
palak_paneer
sauteed green beans
sorry
forgot the name
and veggie_korma
there was also a cold foods station with salads
yogurt
and sauces
for breads
they offered papadum
paratha
and they make fresh dosa and bring it to your table
i tried a little bit of each buffet hot item
and enjoyed each dish
the dosa was light and crispy
with a nice curried potato filling
for desserts
they had ras malai
carrot_halwa
and coconut burfi
i enjoyed each dessert
especially the ras malai
which is a sweetened creamy paneer
it was my first time trying it
and it was delicious
they also had a thermos with cardamom infused chai_tea
with a sign saying it could be made vegan if requested
the price is expensive considering that this is only a vegetarian_vegan buffet
about to dollars per_person for the weekend buffet
sodas and iced_tea extra
but there is a lot of variety to try to make up for it
service was cheerful and friendly
and we got a card for off our next visit after paying for our check
maybe we will check out the less expensive weekday buffet to see how the non weekend buffet measures up
the restaurant itself is not fancy and does not have an amazing atmosphere
but i really love the food here
i've eaten in the restaurant a few times and frequently get takeout
i love the gobi_manchurian
vegetable vindaloo
and special vegetable_curry
i also like the weekend buffet it's a great way to try several different things
delicious
i had the brunch this time
not my first time here
definitely expensive
for their brunch
good variety of breakfast items the pongal was amazing
idly
dosai were just the usual
the sambar was just ok
they should improve considering it is the primary side for b'fast
the gobi manchuria was amazing
the lunch items were ok
one snack
paratha
entrees veg biryani
decent variety of desserts
the gulab_jamun was perfect this is another place that serves it hot
ordered mango_lassi on the side it was amazing
final verdict
i would visit this place again
provided
they improve their sambar
amazing
i was blown_away at the variety of perfectly dialed flavors
especially in the sauces and chutneys
my friend doesn't like indian food loved it
the gobi_manchurian
cauliflower that puts buffalo wings to shame
is a must
my other favorite are the dosai's
i've had a few types
spinach
potato mysore hot chutney which you should try on the side
it's a very intense slow building sweat but incredible
they're all tasty and come with delicious sambar lentil soup
i recommend the assorted appetizer just for the sauces
pickled chili chutney
tamarind_sauce
coconut_chutney
i could eat this for every meal
it's literally bliss food
i haven't done the buffet but my brother said it's a trade off
can't take home leftovers but more variety to try
i was surprised most of the dishes have no animal products
more oily and salty than i like to eat but worth it
like indian food
like veggie
i've got a place for you
if you're one of the v people
you know that finding a good place for your eating preferences is not always easy
sometimes you'll look through a menu dominated by meat dishes for one or two items that are all starch and grease
at udupi
you have an all vegetarian menu with a ton of vegan_options
delicious
if you order something with batura
you're going to get a massive poof of bread brought to your table with your entree that will definitely leave you with leftovers
want another kind of bread
that's a naan issue they have many different flavors and varieties of naan to choose from
take your pick
at some point in the past
a number of yelp reviewers made complaints about the cleanliness of this place
those days are apparently quite long gone
everything was clean as a whistle and service with fast and smiling
you even get a special copy of the coffee news with your meal
this is another spot to put on your list of
must go
vegetarian joints in the valley
i'm pretty sure you're going to enjoy it
my first experience of udupi was the lunch buffet
being an avid carnivore i was very impressed with the vegetarian and vegan dishes provided here
this being southern indian_cuisine
the options were uniquely different from the indian_fare i am used to
and i was especially thrilled about the prevalence of coconut in the dishes
the culinary journey through southern india began with a vada
a donut like fritter made with lentils
dipped in the spicy tomato chutney or coconut_chutney
it was delectable
next came the rajma aloo
a flavorful potato dish with beans
the daal curry
made of lentils peas and beans and flavored with cumin and other indian spices was outstanding with the basmati_rice
the highlight was definitely the shai paneer with a coconut cream_sauce
the paneer
so traditional to southern indian_cuisine
has a texture and taste like that of tofu
the difference is that it is cheese
made by curdling heated milk with lemon juice and vinegar
even the kheer
rice_pudding cooked with milk and honey
garnished with raisins and almonds
was heavenly
with an endless supply of dosai
thin crepe like bread that you can use for scooping your food or rolling your dishes into
it was a excellent lunch buffet for roughly person
i will definitely be coming_back here for dinner
and introducing my vegetarian friends to this delightful establishment
after settling for one or two vegetarian_options on menus for years it's pretty overwhelming to select something from udupi
pages and pages of meat free amazingness
my dinner companion and i ordered the palak_paneer and dhal curries and both were superb
i can't_wait_to_go_back and try more
delicious
i live nearby and have driven past this place hundreds of times
today we finally checked it out and were impressed
the food was fresh and there was a nice variety of items
we are not vegetarian
yet i was totally content with the flavor and quality of food
if you like indian_cuisine
you must try
the owners
husband and wife
were lovely and spent time chatting with all their patrons
we really enjoyed the experience and will visit again
this is the best indian food i've had
my tastes are pretty basic
i'm not into risky food
and this stuff tasted great from the first bite
also
my wife and i judge authenticity of foreign food by the number of people from that country that eat there
you see lots of people from india eating here
with just their hands and all sometimes
it really doesn't get better than udupi
their food is amazing
i recommend the lunch buffet as you get a great variety of food
dinner is great as well and the gobi_manchurian is a must
they recently went through a slight remodel and the place looks great
service is absolutely phenomenal
god the food is so good
the gobi_manchurian is my absolute fav
i will go back to this place over and over
trust_me
even if you're a meat_eater you will enjoy the food here
only thing i'm never too happy about is that the service of the manager is really not nice
he's confrontive
rude and doesn't like to admit his own mistakes
but since i hardly ever see him
who cares
seriously
go
eat
this is incredible food for the absolute pickiest eaters
sunday buffet gives you an excellent sampling of the best in vegan vegetarian food
as good as homemade
friendly_staff and great service
vegetarian heaven
love the uttapam and dosa
i love_this_place
i've tried several different things here but my favorites are the gobi_manchurian and the palak_paneer
it's all vegetarian which was awesome when i was a vegetarian but it's just as good now even when i'm not one
portions are pretty big so expect to have leftovers or split something
i still have yet to make it to the lunch buffet
but i'll make it one day
sometimes they run a groupon
which i've bought before but the prices_are_pretty cheap without it
i wish they delivered
great food
large portions
the gobi_manchurian recommended by our server judy was the best
dosas and n indian items that we ordered exceeded our expectations
friendly service nice ambience and spacious for business as well as large_group entertainment
with madras ananda bhavan to the north and udupi to the south of the city
folks in phoenix wanting authentic indian veg fare are well covered
a step above the usual indian buffet places
this vegetarian place has great options as well as a friendly_staff
we went for buffet on sunday
they had good options including vada
upma
gobi_manchurian
one of best food i ever had
simply amazing food
staff_is_very_friendly and they make food based_on your requirements
we tried paper masala_dosa
chana batura as well as saturday lunch everything was superb
this is another staple of the east valley that i've really missed since i moved to milwaukee years_ago
it's truly a vegetarians paradise
i've only ever indulged in the buffet but have never been disappointed
i especially love the many varieties of fresh chutneys and sauces they have for you to dip things in
i ate here for the first time the other night and this place was stellar
i'm years vegan and i couldn't believe the options they had for me
most indian has ghee and i can't do that but this place has many offerings i've never been able to try
very friendly waitstaff with great suggestions and prompt service
get the puffy bread and the mandarin cauliflower
iknow it sounds off but its insanely good
highly_recommended
went for the buffet
the selection and quality was what you would expect when spending on a buffet
flavors were good
service was good
and the fact that there was no meat on the buffet was a plus
i would recommend
and i plan to return
after the taco's from the taco festival wore off
we decided to try out this vegetarian friendly spot not so far from our house
the reviews seemed to be consistently high
it is pretty standard inside
the decor is nothing_to_write_home_about
the service is good
water glasses were kept full
we needed help deciphering the enormous menu of indian food terms but were able to decide on a couple options
i ordered
forgive me i can't remember
but it was sort of like a lentil pancake with tons of veggies cooked inside
it had nice crisp edges
with a very moist and flavorful inside
it came with dipping_sauces
a coconut
a tomatoey soup
a spice like aoli
and a cauliflower curry type sauce
i only describe them this way to allure new comers to try this place out
all were fantastic
my wife ordered the cauliflower curry but it got mixed up and they brought her basically my same dish but wrapped in a giant rice crepe
it too was delicious and ultra crispy but without breaking into crumbs all over the table
to make up for the mistake
they comp'd her that dish and still brought the cauliflower curry neatly wrapped in a to go box for later dining
we read their_lunch_buffet is really good as well
finally we tried this place and glad_we_did
i know we'll_be_back for more
i had bypassed this place before based_on inconsistent reviews
but things seemed to be looking more promising
the decor has some cool pictures of india
but otherwise boring and sparse
the menu is enormous
it's a little intimidating
so ask questions
we ordered the medhu vada lentil doughnut appetizer
it's a very dense doughnut with a crispy exterior served with a couple different sauces
very tasty sort of filling
my husband ordered an uthappam which is like a pancake
with onions an spinach
i ordered the cauliflower mushroom chettinad which is like a curry
they accidently brought us a dosai
thin rice crepe
instead
but since they would have thrown the error out
they asked if we'd like it
so they packaged up my curry and we ate the pancake and crepe dishes
they were delicious
and when we had the curry for lunch_the_next_day
it too was amazing
huge
whole mushrooms and large pieces of cauliflower with an amazing curry_sauce
mmmm
everything was so flavorful and the sauces were fun to sample all the different ones
the value for dinner was pretty reasonable
most dishes are about and you can easily get two meals out of them
service was good
like i mentioned they fixed the error and didn't charge us for the wrong order the brought out but let us eat anyways
we had our_water_glasses filled throughout the meal as well which is important when eating all this spicy goodness
i'm glad we gave this place a try
mixed bag of delicious flavors for udupi
i love south_indian food
so i was excited to stop in
if you've never had it
it's pretty different from north_indian food the spices are more potent and it's vegetarian
as if the name didn't give it away
it's located in a shopping strip with plenty of parking
there's a lot of seating inside and the staff is really nice
a good starting menu item is the masala_dosai a large
thin rice crepe stuffed with potatoes
personally
i thought the potatoes were a little bland
but it was still pretty good
another good starting item is the vegetable utthapam
i thought udupi's was really good
it looks like a large pancake covered with a variety of vegetables served with different chutneys on the side
really yummy
the channa batura is chick_peas served with a large piece of delicious fried bread
very nice
often times the chick_peas are mushy and overspiced
but these were really good
i had the kedhai bendhi
which is spicy okra with rice
the flavor of the actual okra was good
but it's obvious that the okra was a few days old and dried_out
especially compared to the fresh slices of onion and bell pepper cooked along side the okra
rice seemed reheated
too
overall
not the best south_indian food i've had
but some good solid dishes i would be happy to come back and eat
delicious vegetarian fare
friends brought us curry takeout from here and we loved it so much that we went over for lunch
they have a buffet full of so many wonderful choices tons of variety and flavor
not so heavy as to make you feel like you've over indulged and not so light as to feel inauthentic and americanized
this is a great deal for the price and the service is quite pleasant
too
looking_forward to our next visit
the food is really really bad
even the taste of food is no where close to even the worst street vendor in india
friends if you want to torture someone please take that person to this place
this place won't let you down in that sense
the dishes were limited
the price is high
it was a big mistake that i went there but i request you not to do the same and save your money and time
there are some good things here to eat
the gobi_manchurian is off the hook
the palak_paneer is really good
however
there are some serious health code issues going on with this place
things are old
were cold when i get them and were buffet items from earlier in the day
and there are cockroaches
i had one in my food
unfortunately it was in the last thing i ate
barf
the vegetables in my curry were obviously frozen from a bag
things taste microwaved
service here is kind of crap
i saw another table get their food before us when we had ordered before them
and when we got our food things came out with to minutes between
its really awkward when i have to wait to eat and let my food get cold because were waiting for everyones food
although the food is good
i won't be coming_back here
i am afraid of getting food poisoning
and the roach left me thinking about what other nasty thing i could have eaten during my meal
food is top
servers are amazing
even the music was ambient and perfect for the location
until one day the owner was there
he kept staring at us which was rude and when we asked to take out the rest if the food he gave_us an aluminum foil and attitude
lost regulars there
pretty good south_indian food although just a bit overpriced when compared_to_other similar restaurants
the malai_kofta is so delicious
been here quite a few times but this time it seemed like a lot changed the food taste especially
service was very good
but food didn't seemed to do justice to the name of the place
papdi chat had very less papdi and was okay
gobi_manchurian
speciality earlier
was tasting oily
the mysore masala_dosa lacked the red chutney inside n overall taste but the spinach dosa was the saving grace
great food
as close to south_indian as you will get here in az
the owner is fantastic and his staff is friendly and efficient
the buffet changes regularly and everything is always fresh and tasty
and all the dosas you can eat
i had the lunch buffet and i really thought it was just ok
it felt very limited and i was left wondering what i am missing
i thought because of the good reviews and my passion for indian food i would leave happy but i did not plus atmosphere and service were not great
one of the best vegan vegetarian restaurants accessible to people near tempe and scottsdale
if stopping by during lunch buffet
visit on the weekend because they generally have at least one extra dish available
the lunch buffet is really good
several different chutneys
two kinds of soup
and peas
i have no_idea_what the name of the dish is
that are fantastic
i come here a lot as it is taste
inexpensive and uncrowded at lunch time
great food
amazingly soft and soaked sambar vada and really good
the dosas were really good too
been here times in the last days and i think i will be a visiting again
service is delayed but you can see they are learning the ropes
but overall really good vegetarian food and is sure worth_the_trip
spectacular service and nice waiters
the food was great and i got the peas paratha and the gobi_manchurian
the restaurant was spick and span
great environment and nice pictures on the wall
have tried their buffet lunch a few times
just tried it today
soft n crunchy vadas
perfect masala_dosa and one of the best gulab jamuns i have had in a looong time
parathas needed a little more work but were ok otherwise
special mention mutter_paneer
just_the_right_amount_of spices with the paneer saut ed separately before being tossed in
are the other indian_restaurants listening
please remember the menu changes daily and speaking from past experience
the food taste might vary a lot
will update this review again when i visit again
also wanted to mention the fast service
this place has been talked about both good and bad for many years
mainly the bad due to poor health scores
at last check they still don't even want to participate for a letter grade and seems to have a consistent stream of mildly concerning health issues
being a veg place i figured
that even a few health issues can't kill me
at worst i would get some good quality time with a book so we gave it a try
we started with the gobi_manchurian
it is listed under dishes but it works best as an appetizer
this dish is great and their execution worked quite well
we had a massive dosa which was great with the many dipping_sauces
we also had a vegetable vindaloo that was forgettable
over all the food was good and no one got sick
prices are on part with any sit_down indian place
the ambiance is a bit odd
me and my girlfriend have been going to udupi for the past years with little or no complaints
the food is always high_quality and the price is lower than most other sit_down indian_restaurants on the tempe scottsdale area
now that found out i am gluten intolerant the gobi_manchurian is out
which is my_favorite_dish
the menu is very easy to navigate if you require gluten_free options
the waiters are also very nice and will help accommodate almost any dietary concern
i also recommend the spinach dosai
extrra hot if you can handle it
i ate at udupi on a friday_night when other vegan restaurants in the area were much too crowded
there was immediate seating here with room to spare in the meticulously clean dining_room
i've heard a lot about udupi's buffet
but i was here well after buffet hours
so i ordered an appetizer and an entree
vegetable_samosas with aloo_gobi
one plus is that vegan menu_items are clearly marked with an asterisk
making ordering quick and easy
however
even some vegan items are served with yogurt on the side
so be sure to avoid that
it was no problem for me
as the chutney and tamarind_sauce served with the samosas were tasty when paired with the curry as well
the samosas were served quickly after ordering and were pretty good
i wouldn't say they were amazing
but i would order them again
the aloo_gobi was fantastic
the cauliflower was perfectly tender and not over cooked as is easy to do
the ratio of vegetables to curry was great more than enough substance in this vegan entree for my stomach
my only regret is ordering it with a medium_spice
mild probably would have been perfect
service was quick
friendly
and attentive without being invasive
even the restrooms were surprisingly well maintained
i would recommend udupi to anyone looking for a clean dining_experience and a craving_for_indian_food
their vegan offerings are numerous and i can't_wait_to_try the lunch buffet
one of the best vegetarian food restaurants in the phoenix metro area
udupi has been a staple of me and my family for over years now
the lunch buffet is always well_stocked with a variety of rotating menu_items and the full menu fare is likewise excellent and reasonably_priced
i had lunch here just last week and i forgot to post my review
so
i was really surprised at how delicious everything was
i'm a vegetarian and find it difficult_to_find eating places that have more than one item for me to choose from
the waitstaff was very pleasant and helpful very courteous
the best dish was the okra
not sure the name of it
but it was awesome
pricing for the buffet is reasonable and i will_definitely_return
and bring more people with me
i have a south_indian food addiction
i travel a lot and had previously sworn the only decent places to eat it are in singapore and south_india
but i am really impressed with the quality and flavors here
everything was really fresh
the chutneys sambar flavorful
and of all things
the masala chai was off the hook
everything is pure veg
so you know the chefs are legit and it shows
i used to be
meh
on phoenix but now i can't_wait_to_come_back just to eat here again
ok this place is a solid stars but not quite
i want to come back and order_off_the_menu and try something made to order
i tried the lunch buffet and it was pretty good
the wait_staff was ber attentive and checked in with me throughout my meal
even after i paid
the wait_staff checked in on me
the highlights for me were the spicy mushrooms and the coconut_chutney
they have a chutney_bar
which i truly appreciate
the freshly_made dosa
for every diner
was a nice_touch
i look_forward to my next visit to hopefully give another star
so far in phoenix area this is the place for indian
south
never been to one place so many time specially indian
this place is worth every
vegetarian south_indian buffet
i've been a fan_of_indian_food since my first taste of aloo_gobi
and being a west sider
i am very rarely in this part_of_town
however this little gem is worth_the_trip
being in the east valley for a meeting with my vegetarian co_worker
we couldn't pass on trying out this place
after one trip to the buffet
we were not only hooked
we were already full
i have been to a lot of indian_buffets around town
and this one introduced me to a lot of new items
and tastes
i had never experienced before
being strictly vegetarian
and some vegan
you did not have all those
regular
dishes you find in the other buffets
tandori_chicken
lamb curries
etc
so they were replaced by new and exciting delicacies
the mushoom tikka masala was so go
i could have pulled my chair up to the buffet and stayed for the day
we were also introduced to dosai
or rice crepes
this variety filled with potato and onion
if you happen to find yourself in this part_of_town
a visit here is something you will not regret
oh
one last thing
you know how they say that you can tell an ethnic restaurant is good if
they
eat there
well during my visit
all the other guests were indian
'nough said
absolutely love_this_place for the vegetarian lunch buffet
the food is delicious and the dosas are the best i've had
staff is friendly_and_helpful
my partner and i were so thrilled to find this place on the happy cow app
it is so difficult_to_find good quality vegetarian_vegan restaurants_in_the_valley
this place was amazing
the food was incredible
the staff was very attentive and friendly
i just wish it was closer to home and i would be here all the time
six of us for dinner adults and teens fabulous food we'll_definitely_be_back
vegan vegetarian_dishes so tasty
and very reasonably_priced
every time we drive by udupi_cafe
we think about stopping in finally we got the chance to
we were really hoping for the buffet
but they only have that in the morning
am pm daily
after browsing the menu
we opted for the vegetable manchurian the south_indian thali
the vegetable manchurian was really tasty was a very large portion
it was definitely priced well considering the quantity
the manchurian was a not very spicy
which i appreciated as i'm not a huge_fan_of spicy food
silly
i know
considering south_indian food is always really spicy
the south_indian thali was very large as well contained really spicy items
it was also worth the money
the service was good it wasn't very busy on the week night that we went on they had a new waitress she asked us a couple_of_times if she could get anything out of the way when there was clearly still food remaining on all the plates we didn't mind as she did note it was her first day
we'd definitely recommend this restaurant will be back
after having tried a few more indian_restaurants around the valley i decided to update my review
previously stars to
while their_lunch_buffet is quite good i find dinner and ordering off the menu to be the key to making udupi shine bright among its competition
i was able to overlook the plastic soup spoon that accompanied my indian tea and the slightly rancid coconut_chutney
upon tasting their house made indian pickle
this is only one of places in the valley i know of that makes their own pickle
indian paradise on n hayden in scottsdale is the other
so many items to choose from on the menu and all spiced more authentically than more mild bland
relatively
buffet offerings
definitely get one of their dosa dosai
we shared one among of us
and if you are a vampire don't order the garlic paratha
garlic lovers and those looking to boost their immunity will appreciate the generous amount of garlic
don't let the fact that it is vegetarian scare you
believe me you won't be missing the meat with all the great flavors and textures
best indian i've had in the valley
lunch buffet is outstanding
i'll_definitely_be_back
i've always liked east indian food
moderately
that is
it's not a cuisine that i'd turn down
but it's never been one i'd seek out
either
that is until i discovered the tandoori village
now
mmmmm
i'm thinkin' indian
at the se corner of bell road and rd avenue
happily enough in my immediate neighbourhood
the restaurant is established in a freestanding building that has been
to my knowledge
occupied by half a dozen other restaurants over the past dozen years
let's hope the tv hangs in there
i have dined and lunched there half a dozen times over the past few months
and have yet to be disappointed with anything off of their menu
it's all been good
from the garlic_naan to the lamb tandoori
vegetarian fare is listed on the menu
though i've never tried it
chai
milky tea
is available from the counter
comp'd
interestingly
unlike any other east indian restaurant i have patronized
the management of the tv do not offer a lunch buffet
i heard one of the owners comment that to do so would 'dumb down' the quality of his food
given the results from his a la_carte menu
i'm not about to argue with the man
the ambience isn't much
about what you'd_expect of a denny's
really
the service can be bit amateurish and clumsy
the serving staff being composed
apparently
of work study teenagers from the nearby high school
still
they're friendly and do try hard
curiously
the waitstaff are about the only anglos you'll see in the place
the kitchen folks and virtually all of the patrons
from my observation
are east indian
which says something about an ethnic restaurant
good stuff
the place has been there for about a year
and one hopes they'll be there for many to come
it's lunchtime
hmmm
i'm thinkin' tandoori village
only been here once
and once was enough
the place is absolutely crap
not that i typically care about decor
but it was dingy as hell inside in fact
your bog standard denny's is like a taj_mahal by comparison
as others have commented
there was some ethnic fair skinned girl on duty when we went
i know she was ukrainian because the couple behind us picked_up on the accent
which was almost too thick to understand
and asked her
not exactly authentic
but then again that's something else i'm not typically concerned with
what i am concerned with
however
is food quality in particular places that skimp on stuff
i got a saag dish can't remember what it was
probably beef or aloo and it was completely drowned in the saag
pureed spinach
wife got the butter_chicken
same thing sauce
meat
and the taste was just a ight
nothing special at all which made it even more annoying
i could have cooked the same thing at home for a tenth the price
during the course of the meal
i noticed something which looked like a black beetle with its innards spilling out
i've seen plenty of cardamom seeds in my time
but the ones i'm used to are khaki ish greenish in colour and a lot smaller than this was
i called ms ukraine over and asked her what it was
she get this gave me a scared expression and said in her halting english
i
not know
don't eat it
then scurried off
don't eat it
i had a sniff of the seed and it was definitely a cardamom evidently a giant black north american cardamom
frankly
looking at the place i wouldn't have been surprised if it was a beetle
never going back
i wouldn't have even if the server hadn't have advised me not to eat the food
best indian on_the_west_side remains tandoori_times ii on ne cnr th and w bell
and even that's a far cry from what i've had in sydney and san fran
i second mr k
's observation avoid this place
one of the dirtiest places serving indian_cuisine i've ever visited
there were food crumbs everywhere on the floor
the decor is from the 's
very worn down
and just not the sort of place that you want to visit
to eat
bread was alright
but food was bland
server pointed_out the owner to me and this person was certainly not indian
servers were caucasion kids
teens maybe
and knew little about the food
insane prices considering everything else
not a great part_of_town either
since i can't study right now
i might as well write the review of the restaurant that is to blame for my current state
i took a dinner break and met a friend_of_mine at tandoori village
i was thrilled
since i haven't had indian food since_moving to arizona
i still can't smell quite right
but even so
i could tell that this place smelled good
now
the other reviewers are right with one thing
the place isn't much to look at
but it's not a theme restaurant or some fancy pants hipster fusion restaurant
so i'm not gonna knock it for that
they were playing bollywood movies on the tv
and that was enough for me
if you like nan
it's good enough here to make it worth_the_trip
we had some potato
some onion
and some garlic_nan
i've never had garlic_nan before
it was one of the most garlic y things i'd ever eaten
aside from the fact i'm gonna kill any vampires within a mile
it was fantastic
the main_dishes were all also good
the chicken_tikka_masala and chicken curry dishes were delicious and had enough kick that it helped clear my head
and the paneer was a wonderfully mild contrast between the two spicy dishes
all the food was presented well
as well as indian fod can
to be fair
and everything was clean
for what we paid
we got a lot of food
even so
the late evening food coma that's keeping me from studying may cause some grief later
ah well
at least it was for a good meal
this is a pakastani restaurant trying to serve indian food
so like all pakastani restaurants
they make great meat dishes and their vegetable dishes are poor imitations
the curries were great and so is the naan
the food here is good but it has several flaws
the place is dirty and deserves notice
yes
i don't need a fusion restaurant or copper utensils but a restaurant should be cleaned and not have table cloths that are stained with the previous diners food leftovers or have food on the floor or seats
the vegetarian_dishes are classically unspicy
lacking flavor and not cooked well
nonetheless
it is a good deal and the food is cheap
if you can deal with your water_glass never being refilled and slow service
it's not a bad place
if you are a vegetarian or an indian food snob
avoid
in all of phoenix
this is my favorite over all indian place
we try to go there once a month since we live in the east valley so its about a minute drive
but when we get there
we have amazing food
our favorite are the tandoori chops and the lamb boti masala w garlic_nan
the tandoori chops are to die for and i haven't had better ones yet
simply amazing
when i enter a south_asian indian or pakistani restaurant for lunch i a really want a buffet
i got the coconut chicken curry which was really good
i did however upgrade the plain_naan to a kheema naan
the naan itself was great but i found the kheema a bit salty and the next time i would recommend just to get the naan as it is
other than that it was a good experience
after living abroad for a few years
a favorite treat for my husband and i became indian food
once we moved back to phoenix
i was determined to find a decent indian restaurant
after trying several disappointing restaurants throughout the city
i am pleased to say i found an excellent choice a few minutes from my house
the restaurant is usually near empty when i've gone in for dinner
that worried me at first
but now i consider it an undiscovered gem
i was glad to see that a buffet was not offered because in my opinion
quality matters more than quantity
my husband and i order the same dishes every time we dine here
my husband is iraqi and a lot of indian_cuisine mirrors some of his favorites
although he has tried a couple of different items in the past
we always orders lamb_biryani and naan
there is definitely no shortage of food here
we are stuffed silly by the time we leave
my favotie dish to chicken_tikka_masala with a
massive
side of rice
it doesn't get any better in my opinion
the decor is plain and the staff isn't overly friendly
the service isn't impeccable but the food compensates for it
the good
good interior design
located in a really prominent place
quick service
the bad
some of the curries are really diluted and the quantities are served are less
the indian breads are not only overpriced but also taste worse off when compared to tandoori_times which is a nearby competitor
times also has my favorite bread
chilli naan
which i is not available here
amongst the appetizers
the samosa is good but the aloo tikka is really bland and poorly cooked
overall
i would suggest other local alternatives such as tiffin india for takeaway and tandoori_times for dine in
okay
the place does not have the best atmosphere or decor
but the food is pretty tasty and the prizes are reasonable
good place to go for a casual
quick bite to eat
my wife and i just moved to this area from the east valley where we were near the best indian restaurant in the valley in guru palace at baseline and gilbert rd
this was some of the worst indian_food_i've_ever_had
and this is in no way to demean the amazing meal i had there but i have had better indian food at taste_of_india in fargo north dakota
we got take out so i can't_speak to the atmosphere but when i walked in there was one other person there and the owners
the garlic_naan was more like pita_bread it didn't feel or taste like it was cooked in a tandoor and was thick
i would say they bought it somewhere and just reheated
my wife got the staple chicken_tikka_masala
i make better chicken_tikka_masala
the jew from ny makes better chicken_tikka_masala then tandoori village
there were count them chunks of chicken and a sauce that was filled with whole spices and the wrong kind of chunky
no onions
no peppers just bits of bay leaf and whole cardamom pods
it was pretty gross
i ordered the tandoori lamb_chops as i'm a lamb lover and thought this would be a good thing to try since i don't see it on too many menus
my dish was skinny chops and one massive
i don't what kind of portion that is but it's not a dish portion
this was our first and only time being a patron of tandoori village
i can't_wait_to_try tandoori_times as it's closer and has to be a vast improvement on this awful meal
this was hands_down the best indian food i have had to date
i had sort of given up on indian food with most of the restaurants in the seattle area going to a lunch buffet which is just luke warm gross food like every other buffet i have tried
i didn't want to spend a lot of money and most of their food is and above so i got the tandoori_chicken wrap
sweet mother of ganesha this was amazing
tandoori_chicken
vegetables and spices in a very hot very fresh naan wrap
the service was polite and prompt
the place seems to be mostly frequented by the local indian populations
we were the only non indian people in there
being a family restaurant
expect to have kids all around you
being kids
on a side note and i am not sure if this adds or subtracts from the over all authenticity of the experience but the smell coming out of my ass today is like a mumbai slum
so i hear
woooooo weeeeee
very disappointing taste
presentation of dishes is very bad
ambience is ok
service is average
this is in comparison to so many indian_restaurants we ate in us
dine date
feb
hope they improve it soon
full details below
of us went
vegetarians and non vegetarians
pakoda made of only potato not cut properly
generally we expect onion gobi
chicken_tikka tastes good
juicy and nicely marinated
lacks presentation
the onions provided are not seasoned and are white onions
specifically order for more spicy
hot
but we got it very less spicy dish
chicken_biryani specifically ordered for less spicy and its too spicy
hot
has lot of peas and less chicken
no coriander added
chicken is well cooked but the dish lacks many ingredients
doesn't feel like a biryani
mutton biryani specifically ordered for less spicy and i was sweating heavily by the time i left
again too many peas and less mutton
mutton is tender and cooked well
but the dish as such does not have that biryani taste
vegetable_biryani except for potato and peas
there are no more vegetables
c'mon
at the least we expect a couple of gobi and carrot pieces
the side of raita provided is horrible
there are no cut onions tomato coriander green chili in it
its plane yogurt mixed with lots of water
dal_makhani nice taste and proper quantity
basmati_rice not properly cooked
is cooking plane rice so hard
soft_drinks they do refill it
but the soda doesn't have proper soda in it
its like as if you leave a coke bottle open for hour and drink it
pricing reasonable and equivalent to other indian_restaurants
service good
the waitress is very presentable
doesn't bother to give us choices
also doesn't bother to tell our specific needs to the cook
seriously
i can have that in a buffet or in a fast_food_joint
finally my friend giving us the treat
decided he will take us to a better restaurant again
everyones disappointed
i see folks dissing this place because it's
in the shell of some old diner type place
no
shit
sherlock
this wasn't formerly the taj
mahal but who gives a rat's derriere anyway
i come here for the food
once after eating
here i tried all the other indian_restaurants
in the neighborhood
they were just ok in
comparison
a few have even gone out of business
since then
one of them that shares the first part
of the name had food so bland the only flavor
seemed to be salt
even the rice it came with
was just plain like it was minute rice or
something
and on top of that
they had a really
obnoxious belly_dancer
what the heck is up with
that
a belly_dancer
isn't that like walking
into lolo's and seeing freaking riverdance being
performed
but back to the village
parking here
is always easy lots of space
often times my
group is the only group_of_people not of south
asian origin
that usually speaks to authenticity
if you go for that sort of thing
love their mint
chutney dip for the papadams
the other dip that
comes with them is too sweet i usually leave it
alone
they have a guy that's got a tandoori oven
and knows how to use it
any of the naans are always
a sure thing
i'm a sucker for vindaloo though
i've
tried this same dish in multiple places in the general
vicinity several square miles or so and haven't
found one that has just the right flavor like the
way this place makes it
if you get bored while eating
you can catch up with the latest bollywood hits playing
on the tvs in the place
don't forget to take a spoonful
of after dinner mint fennel seeds combo to freshen your
breath before you leave
hands_down one of the best indian places i've been to
when it comes to restaurants
i'm more of a food over service kind of girl
the service
decor and ambiance don't really matter to me so much as a good meal does
this place is nothing to look at
i think it was a fried chicken shack before tandoori village took over it and it still looks like it
the waiters are teenagers du jour and are acceptable
but you might have to flag one down to get your chai or water refilled
but like i said
that hardly matters when my star_review is all about the food
to start
order hot chai
it will come unsweetened and very hot but stir and stir with sugar while you wait for your meal
you'll find yourself strangely addicted to a second cup
even if you don't like whole milk
i detest it and this is the only time i drink it
the naan basket is fantastic a variety of flavored naans
onion
garlic
potato
also fantastic is the papadum it's like a flat crispy cracker flavored with indian spices
try it with the two chutneys the green one is mint and hot
the other is sweeter and earthier
also try mixing them
i love the palak_paneer a spinach dish made with indian cheese and the basmati_rice
the vindaloo is also amazing
their curries and
sauce dishes
will share a little easier than their tandoori or grilled dishes get a variety of sauces and meats and trade around the table for a little sample of everything
i always leave a little high on spice and very satisfied
it's nothing special to look at
but it really depends on what you go in wanting
if you want a
slice of india
complete with belly_dancers and ornate carpets
you might want to try somewhere_else
but for fantastic food at reasonable_prices
this is your place
best indian food i've had
what the atmosphere lacks gets more than made up for in their quality of food
no complaints with this place
i'd come back in a heartbeat even if it's on the other side of town
i loved food
my first time here
great service
fresh veggies
fresh meat
loved it
i'm coming_back for sure
i really liked this place
sadly the other day i stopped by they are closed
closed
as of the end of
bummer
indian food is one of my all time favorites
my experience is based_on growing up eating at nyc's curry row
th st b'twn st and nd ave
then the few years in my late 's living in dirty jersey i was exposed to a ton of great indo paki restaurants
so
why the background information
simply put i'm cynical and spoiled and didn't expect the desert to have such bombay
ha ha
indian_restaurants
but we do
okay
if indian_cuisine was bad karaoke
metaphorically speaking
and there was a contest like
american idol
and i was on a panel with simon
paula
and randy i know we would unanimously vote mantra_masala healthy cuisine from india
to be the next american idol
there's never a wait and the prices are fair
dinner price appetizer
variety of nan
main_course and drink per plate
the service is prompt and extremely friendly
tonight we brought a newbie to indian_cuisine and the owner
i think she was the owner
she was nice enough to explain what's what to our friend
tonight i had the chicken_vindaloo and i'm still thinking about how awesome it was
the nan onion culcha is made on site
piping_hot and oh so good
the samosa mixed appetizer is one you can't_go_wrong with
i gauge my restaurant on the chicken_tikka masla and mantra_masala passes with flying colors
the tikka tandoori is spiced perfectly and always juicy
the mango_lassi and their taj beer are excellent
probably not together
this place is extremely vegetarian friendly
i'm psyched they are getting ready to start a lunch buffet next week
the place has doubled in size within the last couple of months
it's a clean place with a dark and cozy atmosphere
the decor is a lot more modern then any other place i've been
if you like indian food you will be addicted to mantra_masala
the food was awesome
do i really need to say more than that
ok
so since my family is all about take out lately
i can't review the restaurant's atmosphere
or wait service
but strictly reviewing the food it was a little plate of heaven
well
make that a big plate
i ordered the chicken sag and spinach nan
yeah
i'm a big spinach fan
the sag had the wonderfully creamy
soothing taste i was hoping for
that dish is my comfort_food
the nan was freshly baked and piping_hot
my husband had the lamb_vindaloo and aloo paratha
the aloo was slightly underseasoned for me
and my husband always orders things
hot
so the vindaloo was good
but too pungent for my taste
not for the faint of heart
the flavor was right on
though
all the food had the complex and earthy indian spice combination that i've never been able to recreate at home
but love so much
i'm so jazzed about this place
they're a little out of the way
i would have driven right by them if i hadn't known that they're set back off of the road behind another business
sorry can't recall which one
if you like indian_cuisine definitely go give mantra_masala a try
let's keep these_guys in business
after an emergency room visit
there's nothing like good indian food to life the spirits
this place is tucked_away in a strip_mall in the back corner even
i've had left_overs for days now and am totally lovin' it
the paleek paneer was awesome and they were very generous on the big cubes of cheese
i also had the lamb mantra which i'll happily order again
i only wish the prices were a little less and they were so far out west
one of my friends has been to india recently
and she recommended mantra_masala as a place to go for indian food
she said mantra_masala definitely served dishes reminiscent of those she had in india
and i decided_to_give it a try
i've been to another indian restaurant called tamba before
and i wanted to see how mantra_masala was like in comparision to my experience at tamba
i went to mantra_masala recently for dinner with some friends
this restaurant is small and hidden away
so we almost missed it
the restaurant was smaller than i expected
and the lighting was quite dim
with ethnic music_playing quietly in the background
my friend had the vegetable_samosa as an appetizer and the lamb_vindaloo
my other friend had the lamb mantra and the taj_mahal beer
my best friend and i shared the chicken_biryani
all four of us also had the garlic_nan and spinach nan
the chicken_biryani was a bit mushy and not that remarkable
my friend liked her vegetable_samosa
but she didn't like her lamb_vindaloo that much
i tasted the lamb_vindaloo
and i actually liked the potatoes in the dish
and the lamb was pretty tender
the lamb mantra was pretty good
nice and spicy
and we also liked the spinach nan dipped in the yogurt they gave_us
i gave mantra_masala stars because i felt that the dishes i tried here just wasn't as flavorful as the ones i tried at tamba
furthermore
in comparison to tamba
the portions were quite small but very pricey
despite all that
we had a decent time here overall
cant believe i've been living in the general area for months and never seen this place
i found it due to the taco bell on a day i was in a hurry to get to point b
one thing that really surprised me was the price of everything
sucks when you're a penny pinching college student who's hungry as hell
regardless i asked for a chicken tandoori
the cook was handling my order and recommended i get the day's special instead which was only
being hungry i didn't care and the faster i can pay results in the faster my food arrived
chicken
special
i'd never thought i'd be using this word to describe indian food but here it goes
this dish was a bit bland at first
not bland as in lacking flavor
it had plenty of that
a few heavy pinches of kosher salt fixed it right up
no clue what it was called but it was hardy with a rich flavorful sauce
large cuts of tomatoes
onions
and the deboned chicken
garlic_nan
very strong garlic presence
nice and coarse hunks of garlic on top of the nan
could have been crispier
it was a bit soggy but could have been from the to go bag
overall this place is pretty good and with it's close location it can easily become a regular for me
from am pm is their lunch_specials and dishes are advertised at or around dollars
this was a very enjoyable dining_experience
like others have pointed_out
this restaurant serves incredible indian_cuisine
being somewhat of a connoisseur of ethnic cuisines
i was pleasantly_surprised by how close to the
authentic
indian_cuisine this place was almost like you were in india itself
many vegetarian_options which were flavorful and yummy
chicken masala was out_of_this_world as well
naan was fresh and full of flavor as well
the owner was nice enough to point out that they don't use any unnatural oils and saturated fats in their cooking indeed their food tasted healthier than most indian places without the aftertaste of
not so fresh
ingredients and oils
decor was very nice and elegant
i was very impressed considering the shopping_center location
service was average
nothing too incredible here
but the people were friendly
prices
are incredible
we ate two lunch_specials with quite a few inclusive dishes and paid under
i was very happy with my bill and tipped accordingly
they offer a lunch_specials and dinner prices are also very competitive
i am pleasantly_surprised that this restaurant already has so many great reviews as the couple_of_times i've been here
our party was the only one at the restaurant
let's keep mantra_masala in business
as it is the best indian_restaurant_in_vegas
this place is great
gerald and i went there a week or so ago and really enjoyed the food
their chicken_tikka_masala was really good
the chicken was very flavorful
and the curry was just right
it wasn't the best i've ever had
but it was high up there
and the chicken was just perfect
we ordered some appetizers
the sampling platter with the somosas and a few other things
and they were all quite good as well
the only thing i didn't like about them was they seemed to all be covered in a thin layer of salt
it tasted great
but it was a bit salty
their home made tamarind_sauce was delicious and went well with the appetizers
we also ordered a special eggplant_dish that was also pretty good
gerald didn't care for it
but i thought it was tasty
the service was very good
the waiter was friendly_and_attentive
it was very quiet when we went
there were only one or two other tables the whole time
i hope that this place picks up because it's among the best indian food i've had in las_vegas
the food i've tried is so so but nice decor and the owner and staff are very friendly
the naan can be hit_or_miss here
one time it tasted like pita_bread
maybe they ran out
and another time it tasted like ok naan out of the tandoor
the chick tikka masala is decent
vindaloo is not great
in fact most of their curries
like the mantra_masala
taste alike just different heat levels
have tried the tandoor mixed_grill and it was satisfactory
the malai_kofta is decent but the gravy is more like a soup
also
one thing i noticed about this place is that the dishes are consistently underseasoned
i read somewhere that most americans consider indian food to be salty so maybe this is an overreaction to that
not sure
but i always have to add salt to the entrees
pricing is a kinda high and they charge you a lot for every little thing rice
raita
mango pickle
although i had my doubts about mantra_masala before actually eating there
the sign on the exterior says
healthy
indian food
leading me to imagine creamless plates of tikka masala ew
i was pleasantly_surprised once i actually had the opportunity to eat there
the service was friendly and fast and the food was great
we had the appetizer sampler
fried goodness
chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
garlic_naan bread and we split a mango_lassie
it was a little pricey compared_to_other indian_restaurants that i've been to
but it is close to my house and i will definitely go there again when i'm craving indian
one complaint i would have is that it took not one
not two
but three visits to the establishment before i could eat there due to their weird schedule
closed on mondays
closed during the afternoon during their off peak hours
i get that it saves them money to close during this time
but this is vegas and i would expect a restaurant to be open at p
m
the food is great and the portions are a great size for the price
my friends and i like to get a few dishes and share
very friendly owner and staff
it has a wonderful atmosphere
we were looking for some good food near our new apt and found this place on yelp
we had a bit of trouble finding it
it's behind a fast_food restaurant kind of tucked_away
it was really worth the effort though
it has a great atmosphere and the service is personal
maybe i'm wrong
but i beleive the guy attended to us was the owner or chef and he had great suggestions
forgive me as i can't remember names of dishes but they were all flavorful and as indian food should be vibrant and aromatic
we enjoyed our appetizer and dinner very much
i would suggest this place to anyone looking for indian food
the food of this small indian restaurant is very flavorful
i especially love the chicken masala and their garlic_naan
the service is slow paced
which was okay for us as we were looking for a relaxing evening without the feeling of being rushed through our meal
i give this restaurant a star only because they delivered a food item to our table that was not ours
it took us minutes to get the servers attention
once he noticed that the item was dropped at the wrong table he picked it up off of our table and brought it to the correct table
the truly disgusting part is that we had taken a bite of the item before realizing that it was not what we had ordered
loved
loved this place
this review is purely based_on the food as the service was not good
the food however was pure flavor and absolutely worth going back for
yum
yum
yum
excellent indian
get it on the southwest side of town
very good across the board
delicious naan
excellent curries
vindaloo
it's not cheap but the food is great
i have
on multiple occasions
had the owner come out and ask what i think about his restaurant
i should clarify
the prices are great
but the portions aren't enormous
but
i'll tell you what
this place knocks the socks off of gaylords
ghandi's and any other authentic indian place i have had in town
it probably speaks volumes about me that mantra masala's tagline as
healthy cuisine from india
really put me off this restaurant for a long time
i wasn't sure i wanted to go out for
healthy
food
but after two years of living a stone's throw from this restaurant finally a craving for indian without the strings attached of driving around town won out and we gave it a shot
overall i am pleased we did
there's no buffet on offer here
but the dinner menu
while small
features some tasty fare
i enjoyed my chicken_tikka_masala and the samosas were different
and rather heavy
from what i am used to
but really excellent
my wife enjoyed her shahi_paneer and we both loved the papadums and naan
the portion_sizes are fairly standard for an indian restaurant
so don't expect usa sized portions and the prices_are_pretty reasonable without being bargain priced
mantra_masala isn't my favourite indian place in town
but it's certainly convenient and a worthy contender for if you live nearby
tried this place after reading about it here
it did_not_disappoint
we tried aloo_tikki which has bold yet pleasant flavors
barah kabab was also tasty
but it was the chicken mantra that we most enjoyed
the ras malai was delicious
too
our server was helpful and friendly
awesome atmosphere
excellent food but a bit pricey
i think if the prices were lowered a bit and advertised
they would increase their sales revenue
if i could get a full meal in there
including a drink for i would go much more often than a couple_of_times a year
they offer a good selection of wine and recommend certain wines with each dish
also
they have a really nice bar
overall
i love it
just can't afford it as often as i'd like
we love_this_place
try the aloo tikka a great appetizer of potato cakes with sauce that my boyfriend tries to lick off the plate
the chicken_tikka_masala is excellent
as is the curry
ok this place is right across where i work so i'm here at lease monthly to take advantage of their lunch_specials
what makes mantra_masala stand out from other indian_restaurants is the fact that the food you are served is not coated in oil ghee
lunch_specials here are less than
from
i get the lunch for the hungry vegetarian
i think
it comes with a bowl of tomato_soup
a touch of cream and spice in a rich broth
very nice start to the meal
the entree itself is
naan very soft
fluffy
warm and tasty
no oily residue or butter on it so i don't feel too bad having all that carb
rice the rice is basmati but this is the part of the meal i dislike
it masquerades as pulau briyani but it tasted to bland
i usually leave most of the rice
eggplant_dish ok
this is the best ever
it's soooo good
slightly spicy
creamy and yet still keeping a texture
the right combination of flavors
i can eat this curry bu itself
spinach and potato dish this is a nice and simple dish that tastes good
i have ordered another vegetarian set lunch that was supposed to come with garbanzo beans
channa
curry
however
apparently they don't ever serve it
instead it comes with a vegetable dish that i remember as being pretty bad
i've ordered gulab_jamun here once and it tasted very good
i have never been here for dinner so i can't_speak to the prices and dishes in the evening but this is an ideal place to have a good
inexpensive indian lunch that doesn't feel like you just gorged on sticks of butter
this my favorite place for lunch
the lunch prices are great and the food comes quickly
i wish the tikka masala came with more chicken though
don't even ask to substitute anything
you will get a lesson on food costs and how to run a restaurant
i've never been here for dinner
this place is closed on monday
for me
this place is great because of the location
i really like indian food
but most of the good places are in the flamingo paradise area
and i don't have a reason to go out towards that unlv area anymore
i was here yesterday for lunch
there were or so different lunch_specials with about half of them being vegetarian ranging_from
to
only one of the specials was
with the rest being
or
i don't remember what the vegetarian_options were
but pretty much every plate included a tomato_soup
rice
a piece_of_naan
a spinach puree
you could choose either tandoori_chicken or chicken_tikki_masala for
or both for
me and the so had the chicken masala which was really good
the sauce was great to dip the naan in
and i was pretty much full most of the day from it
i can't_wait_to_go_back for dinner to try something new
i have been to mantra_masala times for lunch and had their chicken_tikka malasa and tandoori_chicken lunch_special every time
very yummy
love the tomato_soup they serve with the lunch_specials and their naan is really good
i am a huge pakistanian indian foodie
so after reading the reviews
i decided to try this place for dinner
i was from houston
tx
where there is an abudant of pakistanian indian food around
so my reviews below may be very critical
pros
very close
nice decor
cons
food
mantra mixed appetizer which includes the samosa
onion_bhaji
and chicken pakora
samosa
filled with lentils
i am used to the potatoes filling
so didn't like this one
onion_bhaji
just taste like fried batter to me
chicken pakora
dipped in the tamarind_chutney
what do you get
sweet and sour chicken
my piece of chicken fell out of the thick cold batter
mantra mixed_grill
they are tiny portion
like others have mentioned
but it's all good since it's the quality that i want to try out at this place
barah kabob
the part that was super grilled was ok
but the middle part tasted kinda mushed in a way
chicken tandori_chicken bazari
i don't know
i tried other pieces that are not chicken_tikka
and it tasted kinda grainey
so i stuck to the chicken_tikka
chicken_tikka
this taste the most familiar
but
i have not seen such a small piece
masala chai_tea
it kinda taste like the bigelow spiced chai_tea that i could easily steep at home
office
anywhere
conclusion
i will drive the further distance to go to my_favorite_indian_restaurant here in vegas
mint_indian_bistro
ambiance stars
food
stars
price stars
we came here in a large_group for dinner and the server was very helpful in helping us order our dishes
for an appetizer
we had the mussels mantra
the flavor was good
but it was overcooked
a lil tough and chewy
we also tried the padpi chat
i was definitely not a fan of this item
for the entrees
we decided on the sea bass
the chicken_tikka_masala
lamb mantra and the dewane handi
out of everything
the sea bass was my favorite
flavored just right
the lamb was dry and the dewane handi was bland to me
i think my favorite part of the meal was the nan
i wasn't too impressed with the meal and after we got the check it made me less impressed
like i said before
we had a large_group
people
and it came out to be dollars a person
or dollars a couple in our case
i'm definitely not stingy when it comes to good food
but for the price and what we got i'm not sure i will_be_returning unless its for the lunch_specials
i ate with brenda l on the same exact day
and we happened to be at the same table eating the same thing
haha
anyhoo
i think i totally had a different opinion of the food maybe because we had split all the dishes and they gave the birthday girl
me
the better cooked dishes
mussels mantra i thought that the mussels that i had were actually really juicy and tender
and the sauce
oh the sauce
i totally wanted to mop it all up with the naan
padpi chat i didn't love this dish but i appreciated the tangy flavors and the crunchy bread
sea bass i thought this was actually overcooked and dry
chicken_tikka_masala i had the specially prepared one with extra spiciness
loved it and it was not dry
lamb mantra i enjoyed this dish a lot because it was actually really tender and not gamey at all
dewane handi this spinach dish did not impress me much
and nor did i even remember eating it
haha
out of everything
the sea bass was my least favorite
and my favorites were between the tender lamb and the fluffy yet crusty nan_bread
so good
from what i've experience
indian food is always pricier than other foods
but i had such a good experience
i guess the price was fine to me
conclusion
i'm sorry that brenda l did not have as good of an experience as i did
but i was a happy camper
going back for more
a quiet nicely_decorated indian restaurant in the southwest area of town
we were the only diners on a sunday_night
which usually isn't a good thing
but they are hidden away
the husband and i shared
lamb_biryani
baked casserole of basmati_rice and lamb richly flavored with saffron
the husband has a special liking to biryani and immediately looked through the menu for this item
he ordered it spicy and definitely enjoyed it
more so with the leftovers the next day
malai_kofta
mixed_vegetable dumplings in savory creamy spiced sauce
i'm all about any kind of creamy sauce and there are very few i don't like in indian_cuisine
their version was super tasty and really good with the garlic_nan bread
yum
i chose medium for my spice
it also came with rice
the dumplings were just okay though
garlic_nan
leavened bread baked with fresh chopped garlic in the tandoor
when going nan
garlic is the only way to go
so good
i could only wish for more
overall
the food was pretty good
our waiter was definitely attentive
until he got stuck on the phone with a to go order
it is rather expensive for the two entrees and condiment we ordered
even with an entertainment book coupon
we'd consider going again
but definitely know why the indian_lunch_buffets do so well in the city
this is the best indian restaurant in las_vegas by far
we have tried most of their menu_items and everything is prepared well the lamb is tender as is the chicken
they are able to prepare dishes with great flavors that are not nearly as spicy as most indian food
the lamb mantra chicken sag are favorites as are the onion kulcha garlic_naan
prices_are_very_reasonable we always bring home enough for a nd meal
i've been here twice
once for dinner and once for lunch
the place is nice and secluded in a little plaza
the restaurant has a very nice mood to it
the colors are very warm and the decorations are artsy
which is expected of an indian restaurant
the food and the service is both mediocre
the staff just seems a little bored and lack enthusiasm
the lunch_specials are cheap
all under from what i can remember and include soup
the portions are decent and the food seems pretty healthy
i did feel like the food lacked some flavor though
my boyfriend got the tikka masala and i forgot what i ordered
but i tried his and it tasted kind of bland
over all
i don't think i'd come back unless i was in the area and wanted a cheap lunch_special
be careful when you order the tikki marsala
i had found feathers in the sauce
i'm not coming_back
i have a few weaknesses about indian food
and as such i am gauging this place on those weaknesses i have
they are
the naan
bread
the curry and chutney
i found myself ordering the chicken curry during this visit
the naan came automatically
but it was a tiny bit soggy and just warm
i like my naan fresh and hot
the curry came not too long after we had ordered and the serving size was ok
the curry was nothing_to_write_home_about
i remember in the past that this place had a good lunch buffet
but the last time i visited here it seem to have been long gone
the establishment was clean
the waiting service was excellent
the food is just ok
in my opinion
if teriyaki madness
which is adjacent to his restaurant
began serving naan at their store
this place would be in serious trouble
my first venture into attempting to find good indian food in vegas has ended in failure
it wasn't bad
but it wasn't good
i've had better
in fact
i've only had better than this
and it has always been much cheaper
this is like
the panda express of indian food with a really nice_atmosphere
this should have been my first warning
the total bill for two people came out to about
a_few_weeks_ago i was in a pretty shady looking indian restaurant
most of the best ones are shady looking
in san_francisco and we ordered a lot more
it tasted better
and the bill didn't even make it to
if you're totally clueless about indian food and your idea of travel is driving down to mesquite
then this place is probably perfect for you
unfortunately
i didn't come to have american food with an indian theme
i was looking for something that had the rich
deep
and complex flavors that i'm used to
the lowdown
naan ahhh
the king of breads
naan_bread usually whisks my senses away at the very first bite
i'm a bread lover
and naan is easily one of the best types of bread in the world
usually
this one was
good
not great
certainly not amazing like it should be
just good
garlic_naan i have to give them kudos on their garlic_naan
it had a better flavor than many of the others i've had
garlic_naan usually doesn't stack up against regular naan
but this one was actually better than their plain_naan
that's not the best compliment
but it's the only one they're going to get today
chicken_tikka_masala hmm
like naan
it is one of the dishes that i judge an indian restaurant on
usually
rich
creamy
and surprisingly complex
this one was decent
but a bit bland
with none of the richness and depth that i'm used to
it was more like chicken campbell's tomato_soup masala
chicken mantra it tasted
thin
like a watered_down version of what it was meant to be
the flavor was actually decent
but once again lacked richness and depth
the rice was a disappointment
and a previous yelper's comment about it being a
mouse sized portion
wasn't too far off the mark
a big mouse
to be certain
but still a mouse
it might be the best indian in vegas
but i hope i'll find better
close to our house and great food
must try the eggplant bharta and the chicken_tikka_masala
two of the best dishes on the menu
regrettably i'm going to have to knock some stars off mantra_masala as i feel like the quality and value_for_money is dropping off sharply
this place has never been our favourite indian option as far as flavour goes
but for a local place where we can get some takeout it more than fit the bill
unfortunately
on our last couple of visits the naan has been extremely rubbery and we've felt_like they have really skimped on the content of our dishes that we ordered
our shahi_paneer on the most recent occasion contained a mere five chunks of paneer in a sea of sauce
sorry guys
but when you're charging slightly higher prices than average for your entree portions already
i expect more than cubes of cheese for my money
on our previous visit we fared a little better
with seven bits
but it's still not very much is it
mantra masala's food is generally ok
perhaps not quite as tasty as some of our favourites
but in terms of value they are going downhill fast
to a point that not even their proximity to my home will call me back
in a word
yummy
indian food tends toward the expensive side
so i appreciate mantra masala's lunch_special menu
i went with
lunch two
featuring chicken_tikka_masala
it comes with a side of dewane handi
spinach puree with assorted vegetables
some seasoned basmati_rice
and a decently sized piece_of_naan
to be real
it's not a whole lot of food for
tax
but mantra preaches healthy food
with that in mind
it's a good portion and definitely satiated my appetite without making me overly full
and most_importantly
everything was delicious
i prefer the flavor of mantra's chicken_tikka_masala over mint indian bistro's
the naan was cooked_perfectly and the dewane handi was surprisingly good
i've never had it before
i haven't eaten dinner at mantra
looking at the dinner menu prices
i probably wouldn't want to
for lunch
however
it presents a nice option
it is a bit far from work
but it's a quick zip up the
i'll definitely get lunch there again some day
note
a sign outside advertizes lunch_specials under
this is misleading
one lunch dish is
the rest are
or higher
stars
we grabbed lunch with a friend who lives in the area
we all grabbed a lunch
chicken_tikka
dwane handi
seasoned rice
naan and tomato_soup
it was good
but not the best
chiken tikka was juicy
but the tikka sauce seemed less complex than others
dwane handi is good
tomato_soup was pretty standard
naan was okay
the portions aren't that big
but it did the trick
i just was more sad about the tiny dollop of rice
i mean isn't that the point of the rice and naan is to sop up the sauces and flavors of the dishes
by the end i was just taking spoonfuls of the dishes since i was out of rice and naan which to me is a travesty
this asian has to have rice
isn't bad for a lunch
but with a lot of indian places offering a buffet for it isn't necessarily value when compared
but good value for being the only indian in the sw and few places with lunch_specials there
service wasn't really personable
we didn't get any drink refills and when ordering drinks he took mine and the bfs drink order and turned around without asking our friend if they want a drink
no drink for you
it's okay if you want indian nearby
but i think a drive out is worth it
so now the rice has become bright orange and inundated with carrots and cauliflowers rendering the actual rice pieces of the already skimpy portion invisible
this mush was also quite inedible
the deewane handi
pureed spinach with potato chunks
was barely passable and terrifically under seasoned
the eggplant_dish was not as good as i remembered it being
the lentil soup was very lackluster and me and my companion struggled to try to finish it
we struggled in vain
the naan was the saving grace of their lunch_special
soft
chewy
in a good way
and the only thing we could scoop up our gravies with
since the rice was not fit to eat
to make us feel a little better we ordered gulab_jamun
how can you go wrong with fried fatty goodness in a sugared concoction
correct answer
you can't
one star for the naan and another for the gulab_jamun
the food was a total and utter blasphemy
i like the lamb tandoori dish they do a lot
it is pricey but feeds me and my husband
this lamb dish keeps me coming_back
one warning they seem to doubt americans ability to take spice so be emphatic
service is weird
i always leave feeling like i was taking to someone with a lobotomy
not mean or inattentive just not all the lights are on
insofar i have found service to be weird at all the indian places we have tried
namaste and the celine dion covers
origin and the credit_card at your table issue
i have eaten indian food all over the world and this place is hands_down the worst indian food i have ever eaten
the service was non existent
in our opinion they don't eve deserve one star
we could not even finish our meals
i only ate a few bites
it was so bad
if this place has won awards i question who the critics are
do yourself a favor and eat anywhere_else
i have eaten my share of indian food in my life and i must say this is the worst
the tandoori_chicken tasted like it was a left over from the day before
very dry like wood
the service is also horrible
we were the only table at
lunch time and they took for ever to give us the
not fresh food
been here a few times when i get a craving for chicken tandori with mango_chutney
the chicken is always tender and sauce flavorful
i always leave with my food craving satisfied
food is delicious
yet service can improve
overall it's a
slightly better than ok
neighborhood indian restaurant
i'm sure that'll make sense to some lol
worth a try
good food
never oily and has great flavors
curry has a little heat to it
which is nice
fresh nan
very intimate little restaurant
perfect for lunch discussions with colleagues or a nice dinner date
service is a little hit miss
but it doesn't take away from the quality of the experience overall
good food
very tasty
place is very nice and intimate inside
place looks closed and dark from the outside
but they are open
they just have curtains blocking the windows
portions could definitely be a little more for the price
but it was good
fresh food
owner a brilliant chef
enthralling to talk to about indian_cuisine and spices
will be back often
very good
went for some buffalo wild wings but instead i ended_up having some indian_cuisine
service was very good
the way to go is chicken curry
basmati_rice
and garlic bread right out of the oven
nice small place
went there today on a whim
the ambiance is zen
the waiter was not bad
like he did his job checked up on us refilled our beverages but didn't seem happy
i would ask a question and his reply and tone would come out dull and rude
like cheer up dude
what's your deal
food decent
small portions and a bit overpriced
i do like the mango_lassi
food is pretty bland
been here a couple times just to make sure i didn't just come on a bad day
there are way better places in las_vegas for indian food
can't_go_wrong with the chicken_tikka_masala
basmati_rice
and naan
ordered take out for people the staff was friendly
the owner helped me load my car
and was expecially helpful when i asked for plates utinsels napkins
overall
very friendly and good food
i'd certainly return
by_far_the_best_indian restaurant in our neiborhood
sw
i think this restaurant is ome of the better indian_restaurants in las_vegas
great neiborhood restaurant to satisfy ur appetite
my husband had lamb_korma and it was very good and my chicken_tikka_masala is very good
as well
i never have a craving_for_indian_food so we don't visit here often but whenever we do
it doesn't disappoint us
naan here are very good but paratha are just okay
one thing that did bother me this time is that the girl
the server
did not offer a lunch menu
which we didn't know it existed
same thing that i ordered could have been less
it made me feel that i was screwed over
so
i highly suggest you to ask for a lunch menu because they were not offering unless customers asked
went there for dinner on a weekday
the restaurant had seperate couples having dinner so it was pretty quiet
the food was pretty good
the spice_level ranges from not spicy
medium
very spicy
we ordered very spicy and personally i did not think it was very spicy
it still seemed a bit bland
the chicken_biryani is what we had and it was decent
in terms of the prices and the amount of food you are served it does not compare
we also had the badam lassi
mango smoothie w almond
the mango was very sour
i will may go back only because it is very close and the food was decent
very friendly_staff
amazing vegetable_samosas
really cute and cozy decor inside
we chose this restaurant because we wanted indian food and this was the closest to summerlin
i am happy that we did
everything was delicious
garlic_nan
samosa's with tamarind and mint sauces
made there
chicken curry
tender lamb in a garlic cream_sauce
loved everything
my_only_complaint is that it took a long time to get the food out but it was worth it
good indian_cuisine
the service is great
the food is also good especially since it isn't the typical greasy style that some indian food can be
be sure to have the samosas and the potato chaat on the appetizer menu
the garlic_nan was delicious to start off with and the chicken curry and lamb mantra were excellent
i'll be ordering to go next time and enjoy the food at home bc the service awful
the food service here are as_good_as_it_gets
delicious
authentic
warm kind waitstaff
i say go for it
i went for dinner with other friends a few nights ago
the food was great
the service
well it wasn't intentionally bad i think but it was definitely lackluster
immediately upon sitting we ask for glasses of water
he brings glasses
with no ice
minutes_later
we ask for ice
mango_lassis and a coke
minutes_later out come mango_lassi and coke
still no ice and still missing mago lassi and waters
this is minutes into sitting down
it definitely was not because they were swamped
there was only other table seated in the restaurant
he eventually brought us the remaining beverages and took our order
we all ordered chicken_tikka_marsala with varying levels of spice but what we got was chicken_tikka_marsala all at medium level
it was plain to see that they just made one batch and tried to pass it off
at a plate just for the marsala
this is unacceptable
actually
as i'm writing this review i'm deducting another star
star for you mantra marsala
what poor service
welcoming and nice service
food is too expensive for the taste
i would not rate this as the best indian_restaurant_in_vegas
its just one among many
so if you live close by there is nothing wrong to try this one
i am some one who give more value to the taste of the food than decoration so i am giving only stars as i have experienced better places than this one
we stopped in for a little snack and ordered the mantra_masala appetizer sampler
and a basket of garlic_naan
don't remember the names of the items on the sampler
but it was samosas
a crispy onion thing
and a batter fried chicken item
the first two were good
but the chicken was tough
the two chutneys that came with the sampler were delicious too
not the best indian food we've had
but seems like the only one in the area
aloha
a very quaint and intimate place to experience authentic_indian_food
it had been years since i last tried indian food and thanks to a special friend who is a regular at mantra massala
i was able to order with confidence and enjoy a great meal
i was pleased with the level of spices in the dishes
the service was at a slower pace than most other establishments
but it set the tone for the evening
no need to rush your meal
just sit back and relax
i loved the authentic dishes and silverware our meals were served on as well as the decor
i was a bit apprehensive about ordering too spicy of a meal
but i am happy to report that the next morning my tummy is feeling fine
i encourage you to try mantra for yourself i think you will be pleased
forget the location
it is non descript
but the food
wow
amazing food
you can detect the different spices used and there is little to no oil
the selection on the menu is not extensive
but ask the chef if you want something that is not listed
they do not rush you and service is is okay
i owuld recoemmend this palce for good indian_cuisine
try the mango_lassi
to die for
flavorful
tasty and refreshing
good food
good prices and good atmosphere all adds up to more than just good
try the
unnumbered
lunch_special
bucks gets you a whole heap of tastes
the place had horrible lighting and the place just seemed dingy
the waitress was nice
but we were the only ones in the restaurant which makes me a little weary
the food was overpriced for the quality that you received
i love indian food and this place was way under expectation and my standard
i would never recommend_this_place_to_anyone
very taste
fantastic service
they pride themselves on no oil healthy cooking
everything was delicious and you don't feel loaded down after your meal
make sure to get a mango_lassi to wash all that yummy food down
this review is more about the experience than the food
i ordered the veggie basil curry
now when i order something with that title i assume it will consist of mostly vegetables and a few other things maybe
well imagine my surprise when i get home with my takeout
open the container and find a couple tomatoes piece of potato and the rest is all beans
meaning everything in it was a legume
due to the fact that i can not eat legumes at all right now
i could not partake in what smelled fantastic
i just wish i had known that it was not actually vegetables
and i would have simply ordered a different menu item
shame on the chef and this restaurant
way overpriced for the size of dishes
ordered worth of food including the mantra mixed_grill over the phone
but when i opened the boxes at home
was shocked to see meats that looked like they have been chewed already
along with poor pieces of chicken was one tiny piece of what they call kebab
i went back to the restaurant thinking a mistake was done with my dish and got nasty condescending insulting attitude from the so called
chef
himself
worst dining both human experience i ever had
don't make the same mistake
eat somewhere ellse
this place has the most amazing food
start off with popi chat for an app
then grab the chicken_tikka_marsala with two orders of naan_bread with and extra side of rice
then finish it off with the most amazing desert
not sure what it is called but the owner made it for me
it has two scoops of his he made pasatico ice_cream and this amazing little warm ball of something
omg
it belongs in a spa
not sure why but every time you take a bite
combine the two
it has this amazing taste that brings you back to a relaxing spa
enjoy
i normally go once a week
this place was very disappointing for takeout
i ordered a garlic_naan and chicken tandoori
it came in a small
under portion white box
but that was just the start
the chicken was yellow and pink on the inside no tandoor char marks
no complex flavors
the onions were raw and uncooked
generally disappointing considering how good the photos look for dine in
came here because it was close to where we live
the food was horrible
my wife and i are avid indian food lovers
the prices are too high and the quality of food is not up to par
ordered chicken_tikka_masala and veggie khurma
the masala tasted watered_down
the khurma had no taste and had strange veggies in it for the dish like green beans
couldn't call this place authentic
would not recommend to others
my cents
the search for a good indian food restaurant continues for my wife and i
this was the first place in vegas we tried
i'm only giving one star because i have to to be able to rate the business
ayayay where do i start
veggie
khorma had legumes in it and tasted nothing like a khorma
no cauliflower
no potatoes
no green peas
chicken_tikka_masala was heavy in cream
lacking spices
cream is cheaper_than spices
rice portion was a oz dish
from a nearby mandalay bay hotel casino
yes we flipped it over
my husband is ' lb
we've never had this prob anywhere_else
raita
yogurt
portion was more than the rice
but it had water mixed in and the seasoning was way off
no cumin
too much anise seeds
no cucumbers or carrots or spices
food was yucky
expensive
and miniature
no buffet
wtf
that's like an indian rest
staple
oh and
we complained to the waiter
he said owner will be in later
and there was nothing he could do
as we were leaving
the owner came and our waiter told_him our problem
he said give me a min
my husband said we're obviously not important enough so we left and i'm now venting on here
shoulda' caught me at the door buddy boy
a bit of background
i've probably ate at more indian_restaurants around the world than anything else
i had an indian restaurant cater my party indian themed bridal shower
restaurant sales went up in the following weeks because my guests loved their food
i was craving_indian_food and this place was close by the office so i thought to give it a try though a co_worker had a less than positive experience on her visit
i had the lunch_special
chicken_tikka and spinach puree with legumes
and ordered to go
the online menu states that soup is included in the lunch_special but when i asked about it they said
not for to go orders
that stipulation was not stated on their_website
the person who took my order seemed a tad bit confused and did not really understand what i was saying
when i went to pick_up
my food was waiting in a
locker type
container and wasn't that hot
i opened the styrofoam box to find half a piece_of_naan
as a fan of indian_cuisine i was most looking_forward to this part of the meal
the naan was thin and simply o
k
the portion was a bit small for
only pieces of chicken and about a table spoon of veggies
the basmati_rice lacked in flavor and disappointed as one of my favorite parts to indian_cuisine
all in all it satisfied my instant craving_for_indian_food but would not go again due to the portion_size and lack of flavor
it was the epitome of the
star
rating
meh
i've experienced better
good food
nice ambience and friendly wait_staff
but manager needs some anger management skills
we were having a wonderful dinner and asked the waiter to leave the drink menu
shortly afterward
the manager came by in a hurry and snatched it up off our table
he then screamed at our waiter for not removing it earlier
as the waiter stumbled with words
we interrupted and explained to the manager that we had asked that the drink menu stay
he apologized to us and then continued to berate the waiter for not letting him know our request
the manager also had a nasty habit of berating the wait_staff on the dining_room floor
in front of customers
we were sitting on the opposite side of the dining_room and could easily hear him
we would have had a wonderful time
if the manager didn't make us feel so uncomfortable for being there
what an awful way to treat your help
really loved this place
everything was delicious
would definitely recommend the lamb_korma curry and the tandori_chicken
the rice_pudding was excellent
i know rice_pudding is normally just pudding
but this had something extra
food tastes
clean
not overly greasy
heavy
or huge portions
the perfect chicken_tikka_masala i have had in a long time
slight tinge of sweetness to the spiciness
was heavenly with the garlic_naan
good food
however
the portions are small
i go there a few times a months due to the fact its the only indian food in the sw area which is where i live
i really like the chicken_tika_masala and the malai_kofta
i had some of the appetizers as well and they are all fried and doesn't go very well with my healthy diet
i would recommend mantra masla if you are in the area and craving some indian food but i think there are much better restaurants_in_town such as mount
everest
hope this review helps
they need to add dark chicken curry to their menu
my_favorite_indian_restaurant
great food and awesome service
it's a small place and tends to be really quiet
it's definitely a hidden_gem
ate here for the first time tonight
and i was completely blown_away
the food was excellent
i had the saag_paneer
and loved it
the cheese and yogurt is made there at the restaurant
and the portions were the perfect size
not too big
and not too small
the ambience would be great for either a date
or just for a nice night out
and prices were reasonable
i highly_recommend it
and plan to be back soon myself
very authentic indian restaurant
really enjoyed the food but nothing out_of_this_world to die for
the interior decor along with the choice of music could have matched the restaurant theme very well
very pleasing experience all around
i was craving_for_indian_food that's why i'm here
had chicken curry and cauliflower with potato
they both taste the same
not much favor
not the best indian food i ever had
amazing food
have been here twice
very intimate setting
good service great food
garlic spinach nan was so yummy
so is the chicken_tiki_masala
good honest food
my wife and i are both vegetarians and really enjoy the vegetarian menu
every time we go we have good service and great food
i have never had anything to complain_about
went here for mother's day since it was close_to_home and we were craving indian
i've had indian food all over vegas and this was one of the worst experiences
i really wanted to like the place as i love to support local mom_and_pop establishments but this was quite disappointing
we ordered the chicken_korma
lamb_vindaloo
veggie_samosa and some garlic_naan
the chicken_korma tasted off and was really oily
the lamb_vindaloo also did not taste like other vindaloos we've had
this tasted a little too tangy
the garlic_naan tasted like it was reheated in a microwave so it got hard and chewy once it cooled down
the only saving grace was the vegetable_samosa
which was filled with potatoes and peas and had good flavor
i wish i could say that i'd try this place again
but i think i'll just drive further and go to the mint or india_palace for better indian food
we have lived in the area for awhile now and always drive by
i read some reviews and was a little worried but we decided to try anyways
i'm_so_glad that we did
we got there right after they opened for dinner so we were the only table there for a little while
the decor was pretty cool and calming
the music was pretty calming as well
our server was attentive and our food was absolutely_delicious
it wasn't busy but it should be
we will definitely_be_going_back
this is a great place for indian food
it's one_of_my_favorites in the valley
it's a little on the pricey side
but well worth it
every dish i've ordered has exceeded my expectations
will always come back and dine again
great experience and meals
soooo my husband and i just relocated here to vegas from atlanta and we love it here
just so happens that i had a taste for some indian food
so i found this on yelp
this is literally minutes from my house
the food was delicious
i got the tandoori_chicken
vegetable_samosas
naan_bread
then i desired something a little sweet so for dessert i had the galub jamun
which were great
just simply two small round balls drenched in rose syrup
this place has a very nice small intimate setting and everyone is nice
can't_wait_to_go_back
i will try the chicken_tikka_masala
finally
a decent indian restaurant in phoenix
and i have tried a lot of them
we went to tandoori_times from a recommendation of a guy i work with who is pakistani and is married to an indian woman
yeah
i know
their parents were probably ecstatic when they brought each other home
so we figured
if he is recommending it
why not
we were pleasantly_surprised
we had some samosas
chicken_tikka
palak peneer and vegetable_biryani
all came out piping_hot and quite tasty
the chicken_tikka was tender and not at all dried_out
the palak peneer was excellent a little sweeter than i am accustomed to
but still very nice
my son
who is three
couldn't get enough of the biryani he kept shovelling it in
and the samosas choolay
sp
were very good
the sauce they brought them out in was just spicy enough to enjoy without overrwhelming the food
so stars for the food
and star for the service
our server
omar
is an asu student and he was great
he said he is studying elementary education so he was really good with our son
we will definitely be eating here again
btw
while the restaurant is good for kids
unless your child is able to eat spicy food i don't recommend it
in our case
my son seems to be able to eat all the spicy foods his mom so loves
disappointed the first time
but with our faith in mr k's taste
we tried it again and was pleasantly_surprised
first time we went for lunch and had mainly chaats
indian snacks
which are only served sat sun pm pm
our obsession with chaats started at the famous vik's chaat corner in berkeley
when we used to live in the area
unfortunately
the chaats here were lacking in flavor
which is a big problem given indian food
especially chaats
is all about the spices
for the phoenix area
we prefer little india chaat in tempe it lacks decor and service but is made up by cheap prices and tasty food
given our obsession with good naan and our faith in mr k's taste
we decided_to_give it another shot
we went for dinner on a sunday and ordered
saag ghosht
lamb cubes with spinach in a light cream_sauce
highly_recommended by howard seftel as
helpfully
quoted on the side of the menu
we
on_the_other_hand
found the lamb cubes themselves to be dry and bland despite being in a tasty sauce
fish goa curry
fish filets in coconut curry_sauce
sunday's daily special so came with rice
one naan and salad
this fish was the bomb
perfectly balanced subtle spices that complimented the tender flaky fish instead of overwhelming it
the naan is as good as mr k claims
great modern decor and good service
we are definitely going back on a sunday_night for the fish goa
thanks for another good recommendation mr k
well
it took us trips until we finally found this place open
they're closed on mondays
and between pm
but fourth time's the charm
i guess
i had to dock a star for their lack of samosas and the usual sweet brown sauce i've had at every indian restaurant i've been to
i ordered the aloo_tikki
chickpeas
onions
and potato patties
asking them to leave off the tamarind_chutney and replace it with raita
yogurt with mint and cucumber
it was very flavorful and moist
though a bit spicy
my fault for failing to ask for mild
i also had the vegetable_korma incredible
it was a thick stew of squash
potatoes
peas
corn
and carrots
and it almost tasted pumpkin y
so savory
the best part was the corn kernels they were slightly crunchy and added an amazing dimension of texture
jamie's meal was the lamb masala
we'd been meaning to try lamb again
as the first time we had it
elsewhere
it was chewy and just
not very appetizing
well our minds were changed
this lamb was tender and succulent
and the masala sauce
incredible
full of complex flavors and spices
it was amazing
we also got breads the onion naan
so soft
almost moist in a good way
and full of onions
and the chicken naan
full of tandoori cooked chicken
and infused with a smoky
almost barbecue
flavor wow
so
some of the most well spiced
tastiest indian food i've had
as well as very friendly_and_helpful service stars
so
i am sorta new to indian food
i was introduced to it last year by my indian coworkers and i am hooked
this place is by far my favorite
i liked it from my first visit
the waiter was helpful
knowledgeable and put up with my indecisiveness
i have liked everything that i've tried here and i've tried a lot
i usually go with my indian friends and therefore get to try_new_things that i might not have ordered for myself
my personal favorites are the chicken_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
and some sort of shrimp dish that i don't remember_the_name of at the moment
they usually have a belly_dancer on the weekend which is always fun to watch
the bad
no samosas during the week
why
the lamb_chops
which our server recommended
were crap
the tiny quarter sized piece of meat was oh so good but they were full of fat and bones
so it was about for bites of lamb and a plate of bones
the good
nicely styled restaurant
bright colors and modern open layout
the appetizer we ordered was a veggie patty on a bed of spicy chickpeas
the lamb vindaloos was one of the best i've had
the garlic_naan was perfect
complementary chai is available
i thought is was a bit week but good none the less
ps
no belly_dancers here on a wed evening
maybe they have them here on the weekends like they do in scottsdale
not a bad place at all
it's also reasonably new
up until a couple of months_ago my office was a quarter mile from this place
i'd passed the sign a couple_of_times and gave it a shot one evening
prior to trying tt
i'd been a regular at maharaja's palace
pretty much on the diagonally opposite
sw
corner of th ave
and if you like you can read my review of the latter to see why i won't eat there anymore
i was pleasantly_surprised by the quality of the food at tt
it's a little more expensive but the food appears to be of higher quality
basically the naan is the freshest tastiest i've had in the us
unfortunately they're light on beef dishes
probably because the moo cow is held in higher regard than people are back in india
and i missed things like beef saag and vindaloo
but everything else is real good
they have
chaat
on the weekends kinda like the indian equivalent of spanish tapas
but there are several items on this particular menu that aren't available during the week and that's a bit strange
lunch_specials are pretty good
there's a different main_dish each day and they serve quite an acceptable portion of rice
that dish
salad and raita
unfortunately most of the guys in my office are phoenix born and for some reason they consider indian food to be anathema
i've literally gotten laughed at when i proposed this place once as a lunch destination
and thus i typically don't have too many lunch partners when i've eaten here
then again these are the same guys who'll eat the most wretched mexican slop i've ever gagged on in my life
day after day
over and over and over
but i digress
one black mark against this place
they aren't open on mondays
it's monday today and i'd kill for some indian for dinner so that totally sucks
anywhere that isn't open days a week really needs to reevaluate
fortunately i can cook the stuff at home that's when i have three hours to spare
summary
it's far from the best indian restaurant that i've eaten at
but it's the best in phoenix that i've found
admittedly
i haven't tried anything on the east_side yet
when we are in the mood for some north_indian style meat we head to tandoori_times
i've eaten at both tandoori_times locations and both are delicious
my only complaints are that some of the dishes are a little heavy on the oil but that can be typical for some indian places especially those that are more pakistani in nature and they do not offer much of a vegetarian selection
we taken family and friends to this restaurant
some of which have never had indian food
with great success
the food is generic enough for the american palette but still delicious for those of us that huff spices in our spare time
i've yet to try their chaat on the weekends but i'm dying to do so
time for an update
and i'm taking away a star for one reason
the food has remained delicious and the lunch_specials are priced right
the lamb_vindaloo i had there on th july was awesome
but there's something that pissed me right off when i ordered takeout recently
portion_size
it's dollars for an oz container of food
depending_on what you get
get three different containers along with rice and a naan and you're almost at
that's way too expensive
no matter how tasty the food is
i know how to make this stuff
technically
although i have problems achieving the flavour
and i know what the ingredients cost
they're making money hand over dot at this place and the final issue i have is that my oz container of chicken_makhani was less than half chicken and the rest sauce
see my tandoori village review for more information on this
they need to knock their prices way down
i want a take out meal for two and i want it to be under thirty bucks
when i can get three pounds of chinese_food for under
see my review of chen wok in surprise
paying double that for less food doesn't strike me as a particularly good deal
don't anyone make the mistake that this place is haute cuisine either
it ain't gaylords
not by a long shot
and gaylords is pretty far from haute cuisine itself
my vote for favorite indian food goes to tandori times
the food is great
the restaurant has a very cool atmosphere
the wait_staff is extremely friendly
and they offer great daily specials
this locations is definitely less crowded during dinner time but i'd eat at tandori times any time
i am sad to say i have to change my original rating for tandori times
not once but twice while dining with friends my debit card was swiped for not only my bill but my friends bill as well
the first time the problem was taken_care_of quickly
the second time i got the run around before they took care of the problem
i have been hesitant to go back to tandori times since this happened and will_never_go_back without cash
i was greatly impressed
my mom and i went here a little after they opened for dinner and it was absolutely wonderful
we both are
kind of
experienced with indian food
but not really
so it was really great to have a server who was intelligent
patient
and genuinely nice
the restaurant was very open
colorful
and comfortable
the food was delicious
my mom had plenty of meat eating options and i had plenty of vegetarian_options
hint
skip the salads and appetizers to have room for dessert
the rice_pudding is cool and refreshing and not like any other rice_pudding i've ever had
expect_to_pay about bucks for whatever main_dish you order and everything else is awesomely inexpensive
like bucks or so for sides and desserts
i absolutely loved this place
it is good food for the die hards and good service for the new
shy foodies who are just getting into indian_cuisine
we have never tried indian food before
when we went we had a waiter that explained everything to us
the food was great
i forgot alot of the names of the dishes we had
but i do love the garlic_naan they serve
also i have been back for lunch takeout and order the tandoori_chicken wrap
it was delicious
i also love their chai_tea
wandered in here for lunch with my wife
i had the lamb_vindaloo and she had the vegetable_korma
it was the best vindaloo i've had in years and teh service was pretty damn good too
oh my god
was this a win or what
i enjoy spice and indian food a lot
but i'm always nervous about cleanliness and getting an explosive asshole later in the evening
however
my experience at tandoori_times left me with no worries
a belly full of lamb boti masala and flying horse beer
as soon as we walked in i was addicted to the smell
curry permeated my clothes as i began to salivate
the waitress was knowledgeable about the dishes and helped in my selection process
the side of rice for
was huge
it disappointed me that they didn't serve the rice with the dish
but it was worth the
we had a free cup of chai_tea to top of our meal
i will definitely be coming_back
i'm addicted
i work very close to this restaurant
i have eaten here many
many times
the service is not always the best but the food has always been excellent
in my opinion the food is much better than the maharaja palace
i can honestly say that i have never had a bad meal here
i also work with many people from india and they all love the place
to me that is a good sign
the only down side i have ever seen here is the service
like one of the reviewers said before
i have had issues with being charged wrong
etc
i would recommend it for anyone that loves indian food like i do
good atmosphere
average food
but a lot to worry_about as far as menu other policies is concerned
food is consistent
bread is above_average
and prices are within normal range for phoenix
why are the traditional appetizers available only on saturday and sunday
and only between
and
vegetable pakorka
samosa
chole poori
and more
only available on days a week
why
this is crazy
closed mondays
common to be closed entirely for private parties
or they switch to take out only because of private parties
aloo mattar is a lunch_special
another dish
eggplant
is a lunch_special
neither one is on the regular menu
and it is hit and miss with whether or not the evening chef can make them
there is little difference between medium
medium hot
and hot
if you order extra hot
chef's hot
there's a huge jump
they just can't get it right
minutes
nobody acknowledges i'm here
it's
and the restaurant isn't that busy
servers
both of which pass me several times
and no greeting
no menu
no water
just flat out ignored
other patrons started to notice i was being ignored
even after hand gestures to get attention
when the server's casual conversation started with the adjacent table i had to get up and just leave
unbelievable
this was my second visit
and to be honest
i'm not someone that eats indian food very much
this time i went with a party of many of them are from india
this time around i opted for the seekh kabob lamb
which was mostly meat on a plate of onions and peppers
i really wished that bread or ngo would have come with it
but i resolved that pretty quick with another order
my co diners were very good
they helped explain other items on the menu to me and help me pick out future dishes
overall the food is very good and very ethnic
the service struggled not only with our larger party but the lunch rush
if you like indian food or want to try it
i would suggest andoori times
the tastiest indian_cuisine i've had in a very long time
and the waitstaff was friendly_and_attentive
the chef knows how to temper the spices to your liking
the lamb_tikka_masala is a must have
i wish the rice and the naan_bread came with the entrees
though
they have to be ordered separately
this place is pretty damn good
even though it was busy
we never had to ask for more to drink or pretty much anything
they got an extra star for the service
as for the food
it was pretty traditional
i didn't see anything on the menu that jumped out as a restaurant specialty
that's a shame because i'm always looking for new things to try
i ended_up getting the chicken_vindaloo
i would have preferred mine to be a bit more spicy but the waiter said that i can request extra_spicy the next time
i am a regular at this spot
past two visits the food quality was poor
yesterday their relish was stale
the quality and service has dropped significantly in past months or so
for the price
this is a great great indian place for lunch
for
you can get a great lunch_special
naan
rice
salad
entree
the curries are very well made and the naan is hot out the oven
i love it here
yummy indian food
much better than nearby taj_mahal
a little pricey but offers indian food in a location where it is often hard_to_find
love carrry out
really quick
the food was good
don't_get_me_wrong
but the after affect is what turn me down
tandoori_times used oils with trans fat to cook their foods
i would like to support the local business
but trans fat should be banned in arizona
this place has the best tandoori_chicken that i have ever tasted
it is so flavorful
they also have tandoori spicy chicken_wings that i recommend
i have never had problems with their service like some of the other reviewers
some might think it is a bit pricey but my motto is that you can't put a price on good food
i love their garlic_naan
their chicken saag is also very good
everything i have ordered here has either met or exceeded my expectation
the menu is ala cart so if you want rice then you need to order it on the side but they give you a lot
whether you have never tried indian food or quite the connesuir this place will definitely be a delight for you
each time i have been here the food has been great and service has been on top of their game as well
prices_are_reasonable and can cater to large parties or even children
it's located in a newer looking strip_mall on bell rd near arrowhead
the
chains
are all around but this place stands_out from some of those other meager places
the inside is clean and nicely_decorated in indian decor as expected
i will be back and think others should check the place out as well
note
i have only been here once as my fiance isn't a big_fan of indian food
but i have been day dreaming about it ever since
my friend i grabbed lunch here on a friday afternoon
considering we went during what would normally be considered the
lunch rush
i was surprised that it wasn't more crowded
but
she had raved_about their lunch_specials so i was excited_to_try tt out
we were quickly greeted with ice water and offered fresh brewed chai
our waiter was great
while he was new
he had just started a week before
but was friendly
knowledgeable and seemed super enthusiastic about the food
we decided to split an order of samosas to start
wow
best samosas that i have had ever
the outside was cooked_perfectly
soft but crispy and warm
the filling of potatoes and peas was creamy and spiced perfectly
they were served with a garbanzo masala chutney that was out_of_this_world
seriously i could have eaten the chutney with a spoon
my friend had the lamb_vindaloo which is the special on friday
so she was served her main_course
a salad
rice and naan
this is the dish she had raved to me about
and she seemed to be equally pleased with it the day we went
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala and it didn't disappoint
the chicken was tender and the sauce was wonderfully creamy with just enough heat
i also ordered a side of chili naan
it was huge way too much for one person
but was so delicious i wanted to eat the whole order
i will be back
and
while i would like to say that i will try other dishes
it will be hard to pull myself away from the samosas
and the chicken_tikka_masala
seriously
check_this_place_out
food is awesome
so i have never eaten alot of indian food
but friends of ours suggested dinner there so we went
i am so glad i did
talk about delish
the chicken saag was one of the best things i have ever eaten
prices_are_reasonable
service is so so and the food yummo
we had chicken saag
chicken_tikki_masala
fish masala
garlic_naan and rice
the four of us left stuffed and happy
it was so good
i went back the following week for lunch only to discover some terrific lunch_specials
bucks for more lunch then you can eat
all i can say is
go
only been here once but thought it was very good
will return next time in the area and looking for indian
we had a party of on a friday_night
happy birthday
g
some of us has had indian food and the other half was in for an adventure
got there in time for happy_hour
i ordered the spicy chicken_wings mild
my mouth was on fire
too spicy for me
but they were good
the garilc nan was so goooood
i got the chicken tandoori wrap
yum
they made it with less spicy for me
yes
i am a whimp
in the middle of dinner
the music got louder
we were not sure what is going on but then out of no where there was a belly_dancer
she is shaking and moving all over the resturant
the kids loved it
they went out to dance with the belly_dancer
so of our adults too
it was a fun filled events and the food was good
my husband loves indian food
so we stopped by for lunch since we were on bell road already
i had to order the chicken tandoori wrap again
it was good and the naan was just fluffy enough
my husband ordered the daily special
beef stew
garlic_naan extra
and comes with rice
the daily special was awesome
we had great service and the waiter was good to look at too
great food
good scenery
i am one happy woman
better than we expected
we stopped in fairly late on tuesday night and it was still quite busy
there were three of us and we ordered the lamb_vindaloo
a lamb special
sag paneer and naan
we requested them
chef spicy
which our charming waitress informed us was as hot as it gets
we were delighted to discover that this was actually quite spicy
both lamb dishes were excellent
the naan was fresh and hot from the oven
my only quibble was with the saag_paneer which was heavy on the saag and light on the paneer
but still pretty good
it's a bit pricey for a neighborhood indian_joint about for the three of us with one beer
but it's also a bit nicer than the typical indian restaurant
service was friendly and efficient
we'll_be_back
what a great unexpected surprise of delicious indian food in my hood
we didn't get to do too much research on indian_restaurants that night and since there are not many great indian_restaurants in central and north phoenix
i didn't feel compelled to put in the effort
learned helplessness you can say
after driving around before our movie
we found this wonderful restaurant and will_be_coming_back for more
tandoori_times has great ambiance with fun indian art on the wall
our servers were very pleasant and you can tell they were happy working there
we tried the lamb briyani
saag_paneer
and chili naan
although they had some innovative and creative indian dishes we decided to stick with more traditional dishes
the saag had a slightly more watery consistency than what i am used to but the taste was incredible
the lamb briyani was light and not so oily like other briyani dishes
my favorite was the chili naan
which was light
fluffy
and tasted awesome baked with chilies and cilantro
their side
condiments
was unique
which included a mixture of pickled chopped ginger
lemon
garlic and other spices
we were so glad to have tried this restaurant and hope to be back to try their other dishes
this is the best indian food that i have ever had in arizona
maybe even in the entire united states
the chicken_tikka_masala is to die for
i'm used to indian food in london
and anyone who's eaten indian in london knows that indian out here doesn't even compare
but this place is absolutely_amazing
my mother
who is indian and a snob when it comes to indian food
surprisingly loved this place
whenever i tell her i'm going to tandori times she is very very jealous
the staff is nice
service is good
havent been there when the bellydancer is there
which would kind of irritate me
only thing i didn't like was that one of the waitresses didn't speak english
which was odd seeing as she was a server
i was just asking for a take away box and it seemed too much for her to handle
decent prices
a bit pricey compared to thai or pizza or something
but its well worth it
apart from the chicken_tikka_masala
that i order everytime i go
the eggplant_dish is also very good
as well as the lentils and the garlic_naan
this place is a must
i have been in this neighborhood for a week from calif
could'nt find a good independent place to eat untill i drove past this indian_bistro
it is similar to chaat cafe in fremont ca
very pleasant interior
food was great
crew seemed very disorganized and inexperienced
need basic customer_service training
customers were waiting for a long time before some one seated them
one almost spilled water on me
one hand did not know what the other was doing
i still will recommend_this_place
just bear the inexperienced crew in the dining_area
i will visit this place again
due to the terrible service we experienced
i should give this place star but the food was delicious so i'm giving it stars
four of us went here on our lunch break
note to self and others
do not go to this place if you are pressed for time
our waitress had no_idea_what she was doing and messed up of the orders at our table
we were never offered anything to drink besides water and had to ask several time for plates once our food arrived
and trying to separate our payment was simply too much for her to handle
i will say my chicken_tikka_masala was absolutely_delicious and is one of the best i have had in arizona
they do charge extra for rice
which i find odd
the best part of ordering indian food is pouring the sauce over rice
the naan was excellent too
the terrible service and extremely long wait time for our food as well as our check was unacceptable
so i don't see us going back
i love_this_place
best indian food around here
and the most awesome free_chai ever
my favorites here are the mango_lassi
the garlic_naan and the chicken_makhani
and i pretty much order the same thing every_single time
but at times when i'm feeling adventurous
i go for the goan fish_curry
probably the only time i'll touch fish in non sushi form
or the chicken_biryani
they have a big menu to choose from and the food is as authentic as it gets
they do tone the spice_levels down quite a bit though which might be a good or bad thing depending_on how spicy you like your food to be
i love_this_place and take all my non indian friends here whenever they crave indian food
i'd vouch for it's awesomeness any day
it ok but not great and service is so so
my fav is the chicken_tikka_masala and their seasoned rice
their samosas choley is good w the red sauce
i will work for this stuff
frequneter
the gal that serves us water is super fast and efficient
my fav server is suaznne
sp
she's fast
outgoing
friendly
gets stuff done
chicken_tikka_masala
seasoned rice
samosas choley
i blow my paycheque here cuz the stuff i order above is yumminess
i like the open atmosphere of this place
they got belly_dancing performances
dancer walks around shaking it while you eat
fridays
pm ish
just remember they are closed mondays
and have specific operating times for lunch
i think noon to
the staff are very friendly here
but the chicken_tikka_masala has gone downhill since i last posted my review
it got a lot more runny watery and lacks the flavor it used to have
kind of disappointed bc it was my weekly fav dish
this has to be one of the best indian_restaurants i've been to internationally
they've nailed a lot of dishes down perfectly to that
restaurant style indian food for america
type of cuisine
i've been here times now and the food has consistently been good
which is a good sign
and i'm referring to the location near th something street and bell
there is another one i've heard is not as good as this place with the same name
i've tried the tandoor chicken
lamb_tikka_masala
karahi chicken and chicken_makhani
the naan is really good too
the free_chai is the icing on the cake
their meat is really always juicy and tender
barely ever dry like it is at so many other indian_restaurants
i'm very apprehensive about eating at of indian_restaurants anyway
as most re use other people's food
over undercook things
or grossly underflavor things
we've had the same waitress all times
i'll agree
the service from her end could really use some major improvement
but
indian_restaurants in general are far from perfect
and some leeway is required
would definitely eat here again
even if i were disappointed at least once
agree the tikka masala has gone a little thin in the past few months
will only go here on a lunch hour so i can order the special and get a good value
last trip people had lunch and a had a glass_of_wine and it was since everyone ordered ala_carte too steep for the amount of food you get
i dined here for the very first time last_night
so i can not comment on the consistency of the food or service
just my one time experience
we were immediately greeted and seated when we arrived
and when the gentlemen found out that we had not been there before he told us all about the weekend experience with the belly_dancing
and hookah
he also told us to make reservations for the weekends
cause they do get very busy
our waiter was very nice
and offered up some great suggestions for noobs like us
this was only my nd time eating indian food
we ended_up ordering the chicken_tikki_masala
and the coconut chicken w rice
the food arrived reasonably quickly
and neither dish was runny at all like other reviews point out
everything was hot
and delicious
and there was enough left over for probably meal
it did take awhile for our server to get our check to us
but he was very aware cause when he brought our check he also brought some complimentary ice_cream as an apology and a thank you for our patience
over all i had a great experience at this restaurant and wish it hadn't taken us so long to try
we will be back
this is the first time i have eaten indian food
so i would not be able to say if it is the best around
here is what i do know
i had the lamb tikka_marsala
it was very good and they brought the chutneys on the side so i could adjust the heat according to my own white boy whimpy palate
the service was good and i will be back to try other things to expand my culinary boundaries
we are north indians and know our north_indian restaurant food well
we've been going here from a long time now
we love the food here
earlier was a mix of dine in and take out as the belly_dancer is annoying
it is for bachelor's to come drink
look enjoy but most families cannot tolerate it
seriously she knows a squat about the songs she is dancing on
and they all are kinda old bollywood songs they dont update themselves music wise
but i really appreciate her trying to make a good time for evreyone
we went once in an afternoon
and decided to order some snack items like chhole bhature
it was horrible as the oil was swimming on it and i could not eat it
i know it is a fried item but the cook should at least try to pat it dry
but no
he wanted us to have the oil
anyways that is why we stick to our main_course
since we had our baby we only take out but not very often
but yes no doubt the food is good
we love paneer
malai_kofta
chili paneer
paneer tandoori
which is actually called paneer_tikka in india
the dal_makhani is sort of a make or break for an indian restaurant in india and every restaurant has a chef who only makes dal_makhani for them
yes its that important
they cannot get it right
they put chana dal in dal_makhani
really
when i make it at home i make it better than them
yes i do
tasty food
decent prices and quick service
i especially like the chilli naan and malai_kofta here
summary
without claiming to be the arizona's foremost expert on indian_cuisine or
in fact
even knowing what the hell i'm talking_about
this is my favorite indian food restaurant
the rice is never sticky
the naan is always perfectly toasted and sacrilegiously tossing chicken_tikka_masala atop the two of 'em completes an excellent naan taco
this review is pretty much giving that combination of items along with the chicken_tikka wrap stars
i certainly can't vouch for the whole menu
pricing
the
chicken_tikka wrap on the lunch menu is delicious
lunch service is prompt
dinner prices and portions are average
indian food seems to always be in the range minimum
concerns
if you're thinking about coming here on a friday or saturday
you may want to consider calling ahead to find out if you're going to be subjected to shiva's meal tarnishing minions
the belly_dancers
along with the accompanying db indian techno soundtrack
it only happened to me once and
thank vishnu
i was signing the bill at the time
loved the food or maybe it was the hours of non stop driving that precipitated this
in any case
service was attentive
although we went at nearly closing time
food was hot and tasty
not much to complain_about
i would definitely recommend_this_place_to_anyone looking for good indian food
awesome service
very nice waitress
and really comfortable and clean interior
but the food leaves a little something to be desired
it seemed like everyone at the restaurant enjoyed it
but i found the food to be quite plain and probably watered_down for the locals
very high prices for indian food as well
maybe it's just not my taste
but if you go home without any stomach pains
it probably wasn't real indian food
not much i can say other than this place is good and tandoori village is awful
i had the lamb_curry
and my wife had the chicken_tikka_masala
it was all wonderful
i wouldn't order the paneer_pakora again but that's ok
it'll save us some money
like i said
really really good
the food is totally terrible
me being from india
i expected a bit more from this restaurant
but looks like the chef just forgot how to put out a good dish
i ordered a paneer saag which was bland
watery and lacked any flavor what so ever
the paneer was old and fragmented
distasteful and above all
it was stale
i would never pay for a dish and get stale food
the soda had no fizz and wasnt cold enough
the music was so loud that i had to shout if i had to talk to my wife sitting across the table from me
the ambience is poor and the lighting is so dull that it resembles more like a whore house rather than a restaurant
i am never going back to this restaurant or any of its other locations
the food is utter boring and would suit a palette which has no taste of spices
disappointing
everytime i come here i remind myself to put it higher on my list
ya the decor is kinda kitchy
the food is quite good
that is why you go to restaurant isn't it
there is naan is spot on and the lamb dishes simply rock
puts the greek places to shame
i have my favorites but have never anything here that i would put in the bad column
authentic works here
this is one of the better places to go for indian food
i have only had the lunch items at this place
i usually go with either the chicken or lamb lunch_special
it's pretty clean and service was good for a busy lunch time
i hear they have a belly_dancer on friday evenings
work in the area
so i've stopped by with coworkers countless times
the service has been bad out of times
but the food is some of the best_indian_food_in_town
lunch_specials are really good and the happy_hour is great
so until now i just put up with it
until today
when i tried to call in an order and they hung up on me
three times
literally just clicked the button to end the call without even picking_up
and left me in a confused silence i had full bars
i hope it was just a phone problem
but honestly
it didn't seem that way
also
splitting a check here is an absolute nightmare
they write all the checks by hand and refuse to get some form of electronic system
i understand that splitting a check ways is crazy
but there's only typically of us
depending_on who waits on you
they will throw a fit when you ask to split the bill
the saving grace though
is there's one waiter who's always really good and will do it for us no problem
everytime we go
we pray that we get placed in his section
haha
honestly i can't say i won't come back
because there isn't much else in the area and the food itself is really good
but don't expect any form of hospitality
and don't bother during full price hours
the dinner prices aren't work this
i'm not a fancy restaurant type of person
i don't require top_notch service
but i'd at least like to not wait minutes for food during my lunch hour
then another for the waitress to bring the bill
and have her get angry at us for trying to pay the damn bill
i absolutely love the food here
everything is cooked and seasoned to perfection
the service is sometimes a little slow
but i go for dinner and don't mind since the food is so delicious
the naan is so good
and the tandoori wraps are amazing
in short
very very tasty indian non_veg food
service is ok
pricing is a little to the higher side
tandoori_chicken is well cooked
lamb_biryani is my favorite
chicken_biryani is excellent
i'm a fan of biryani
s
yes
the naan is good and chicken masala is the perfect side
do not try out veggie curries here
mostly they are not well cooked or seasoned
staff is ok
service is a little delayed
but understandable
i've been there only for dinners and the ambience looks intimate
somedays they have a belly_dancer
well she's good with bollywood songs too
they seem to have some happy hours and lunch time discounts
but i've tried out only dinners and the pricing is a little to the higher side
bottom_line
tasty food
need to carry a heavy valet
suitable if you are planning to impress someone
i rate this place a
my wife and i eat here often because we love the food
particularly their lamb dishes
the lamb kebabs are terrific and the lamb_tikka_masala is one of the tastiest dishes i've had anywhere
they make great naan
the chile and potato varieties are the real standouts
the onion_bhaji is also a must
a word of caution
stay_away friday and saturday nights if you don't like belly_dancing
having some proto stripper clang loud zills
finger symbols
in my ear while i try to eat does nothing for me
nothing good at least
also
belly_dancing is of mid eastern origin so i have no idea why it would be featured at an indian restaurant
if i wanted to watch a stripper
i'd prefer to do so the old fashioned way
at a club of ill repute
in the dark
where the staff and i can both veil our combined sense humiliation and degradation
also be on the lookout for the owner
be prepared for endless conversation if he's there and drinking
i'll will_be_returning to tandoori_times often
but i'll be hiding out
averting my eyes and leaving my handful of singles at home
so delicious
the amazing spices are going to haunt my dreams
unlimited chai
mango_lassi
matter_paneer and garlic_naan
i almost died
stole some of my boyfriend's raita that came with his lamb_biryani
which was enough to feed two hungry people very happily
since my matter_paneer was so deliciously spicy
we were one of two guests on a thursday night and waited for nothing
service was amazing
our server had great suggestions for both of us
good food
spicy
i was sweating like a wh
on quarter night
they just need to stay stocked better though
out of two of items we ordered including rice puddin
they serve one of the best tandoori_chicken in the valley
unlimited chai
service is good
if_you_are_looking for a quiet dinner avoid fri
sat and sun
they have belly_dancing and the worst part is they put the music so loud
the even its difficult for the server to hear you
this place is fantastic
i loved the chicken_tiki_masala
the tandoori_chicken is amazing
the service was great even when we came in close to closing time
they gave_us great food and it tasted great
i'm so disappointed in the decline of this restaurant
i once loved the food here
but my last experience was so bad that i haven't been back
we came for lunch and the place was nearly empty
that should have alerted me
normally it was at least half full a few minutes after opening
we ordered
i'd brought a friend who loved indian food and hadn't discovered_this_place
she was very excited about coming and the free_chai
after ordering we walked over to the chai station and drew two cups
ugh
it was watery
milky and bitter
it tasted old and not at all up to their normal standard
i mentioned the poor quality to the server
who was really trying to be helpful
i even went over and got her a cup and she couldn't drink it
she went to the back and come out and said
the cook's don't want to make a fresh batch
whaaa
so we dumped the chai and waited for our food
i ordered the chicken tandoori with garlic_naan and my friend had the chicken_tikka salad and we waited
and waited
and waited
you could hear arguing for the kitchen
not a good sign
the server avoided us
after minutes i called her over
she said the food for coming
i drank a lot of water while waiting so off to the bathroom and on my way i pass a staff member leaning over a counter eating his lunch
they just opened
they had customers
when the food finally arrived it is
meh
not the quality i was accustomed to and not the place i'd bring anyone else for sure
this visit was on march
i haven't been back since to a place that was once a regular once a month stop
oh_yeah
and my friend hasn't been back either
i honestly think it has a big management problem
this place is fantastic
it is a bit of a hidden_gem
not easily seen from the road
we got the chicken_tikka_masala
wonderful
and the curried chicken which i have dubbed the best i've ever had
we also got the naan basket which is several different flavors of naan
we will definitely_be_going_back
food was amazing
service was fantastic
if you know indian food then you can tell upon entering that this is the real deal
these people know how to cook and are proud of it
i saw somebody using what looked to be the size of a boat oar in a pot almost big enough to get in and it smelled like heaven
i sometimes just order the naan_bread on my way home to accompany a salad
it is like bucks and the best in town
you can close your eyes and pick anything off the menu and you_will_not_be_disappointed
me and the wife were in the mood for something different
indian food was something different for us so we yelped something indian and this spot popped up
so we entered and were greeted_by the waitress
nice little place
i look around and the atmosphere is nice
theres a few families in there
some people at the bar
your usual nice_atmosphere
we really wanted some authentic_indian_food
and as far as i can tell
i think we found it
because we had no experience with authentic_indian_food
i had to give it the
authenticity test
here's the test
when you want to find out how authentic and ethnic restaurant is
you look at how ethnic its population is
this restaurant passed the test
it was very nice and refreshing to see the diversity in this place
we proceeded to look very lost and confused about their huge menu so i asked the waitress for help because we were clueless to the lingo on the menu and she was really cool about it
she explained what everything was
and how you pair it
we began with the samosas
a pastry filled with potato and green peas
with garbanzo beans on the side
served with three different chutnies
a green one
a red one
and then some pickled stuff there was ginger in there for sure
the samosa was really good
but i gotta say the garbanzos were freakin delicious
it was freakin' good
all of it
then we ordered the chicken_tikki_masala
with some rice and naan
the whole thing was gone
i guess the best thing i can say is that this place from the sounds of it seems very authentic
the food is good
and the server was cool
the only thing that i felt awkward about was around
a belly_dancer came out and i honestly didn't know what to do
i had my pregnant wife sitting next to me while this girl is doing her thing
didn't really know the etiquette
i reached for a dollar
then realized i was in the wrong place
then everybody else started to take out dollars
so then i got confused
it was a weird dynamic
didn't know where to look
like
if i looked did i look like a pervert
i mean there's families around
but at the same time i think i was supposed to
so from the looks of it
you give her a dollar
but then she'll stand you up and make you dance with her
take what you will from this
go there it was a cool experience
i went about a year_ago because of a groupon
we had just moved to the valley and were jonesing for some indian food
this place had some pretty good reviews so we took our groupon and checked it out
the atmosphere is really nice
it is upscale and has a nice decor
it is different than a lot of the more run down indian places i have been to
anyways
thank god we had a groupon
this place was so expensive
i have had indian food in different parts of the world
germany
california
kentucky
and georgia
and was shocked at the prices
plus here
and other valley indian places
you have to pay for rice
why do i have to pay for rice
how am i supposed to eat this liquid delishness without a semi solid medium to bring to my mouth
i know its only dollars
but its the principle
just give me rice
and keep it coming
don't nickle dime your customers
i was already paying dollars for an entree
the food was really good
i enjoyed it
i had my usual of paneer tike masala and it was perfect
husband had chicken_vindaloo and liked it
he is a hot and spicey lover
and like most restaurants it did not quite bring the heat
he wants to enjoy his meal with tears streaming down his face and his sinuses cleared for the next year
this place while flavorful
did not bring the heat he so desperately is searching for
we also shared some naan
and i don't really remember if it was good or bad
so i guess it was just ok
so i liked this place
but will i be back
no probably not
its just too rich for my blood
i am still on the hunt for spicy
delicious indian food that is cheap in the valley
anybody know where i can get some
we are regulars here
any place that my year_old daughter will go to that doesn't have an indoor playground must be good
love the chicken_tika_masala
spiced to order
last few times we went
they did not have the 'flying horse royal lager'
which is a bummer
would give stars if they didn't 'nickle and dime' you over the rice and naan should be included with an entre
i had dinner weeks_ago with my friend this restaurant
food is all tasty but price was kind of expensive for us
we ordered
marsala chicken half size
or small chicken
and kinds of curry
very small
n kinds of naan_bread
was looks really small
we paid bucks tips
surprisingly good indian food in the middle of the desert
we went with a group and while the service was a tad slow for an empty restaurant
the portions and flavors did_not_disappoint
the location is a bit hidden in a strip_mall
but don't let that deter you
i personally enjoyed the variety of the naan they offered and will be back
may i say i have been here a few times before and i don't think i would have given a
maybe a
or at times
they do get points for the delicious free_chai
though
this time
the company made all the difference
i went with a group of coworkers friends from india
i arrived late and they had already ordered
we usually eat family_style
which i love
what a great surprise their choices were
we first got different dishes
all dry
one chicken
one fish and one i believe was lamb
that last one looks to me like sausage hamburger meat consistency
i need to learn my names
then we got rice
white and saffron
and biryani
plus dishes with reddish sauce
fish
chicken and shrimp
plus baskets of naan
i think only the naan in the top was garlic and the ones at the bottom were plain
but they were still very good
also
i asked for some butter to eat with a piece_of_naan an they brought me what seemed to be real
rich
flavorful butter
yum
plus
let me say it again
the free_chai
delicious chai
well
if you don't take sugar you may want to take your own sweetener because they only have sugar and sweet'n low
of course
the service was very good
and may i add that in the past we have asked for split checks and they don't seem to frown about it
most authentic_indian_food outside of india
i know
because i've been
don't let the idea of exotic food scare you away
there's something for everyone here
even vegetarians and children
try the paneer
pressed cheese
dishes or samosas choley if you don't like meat
try the chicken or paneer makhani if you don't like the heat
for medium spicy dishes
the chicken_tikka_masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan_bread
if you want a bite of something that'll bite you back with a really great flavor
try the tandoor fish wrap
the key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of or more
get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table
you don't have to drink alcohol
but there's a full service bar at all of the tandoori_times locations and the beer_selection is above_average
this is the nd of the locations and features a nice inside area with a squishy
but comfortable patio where you can enjoy hookah while you eat
bellydancers join the fun on friday and saturday nights
decent value if you crave very good quality food
an exotic atmosphere and an authentic indian experience
ok
the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic
but it's definitely exciting
one of my favorite weekend hangouts
solid out of
i'm giving them an extra star for their lunch_specials which is an incredible value for the amount of food that you get
this is my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in the area
it's right next to school
favorites include achari lamb
mmm so flavorful with no hint of gaminess
and the lunch portion will feed you for several meals
i've also had the chicken_tikka_masala which was good and chicken_biryani which came with a huge side of raita
yay
biryani is the food of my people
bengalis
so i am very picky when it comes to it
i'd say tt s biryani satisfies my cravings
i also love to end my meal with their complimentary chai
watered_down some days
good other days
didn't care for the chicken_tikka wrap lunch_special
thought it was too dry
their naan is too doughy for my liking
i prefer mine light and a little crispy
other than that i have no complaints thus far
their decor is nice
and their dinner prices_are_pretty standard for a nice indian restaurant
their red meat is halal too
definitely will be frequenting this place
i have visited this restaurant multiple_times
mostly as a part of a large_party
greater than
and i'm impressed at the quality of service
the ambiance is nice and the belly_dancing on friday nights are pretty good
people really get into it
although it does get loud due to the music
the staff is pretty friendly and generally let you know right away if something is not available and suggests alternatives
i have found that some of the tables do not have the necessary spoon fork knife at times and the staff does not bother to check that
the food is generally good
but i have been disappointed once by the okra curry
bhindi_masala
it was not what i expected
the quantity of food is good and for
we usually end up eating a lot and even taking some food home
the free_chai
tea
is an added bonus
tandoori_times is a restaurant that has reached a new low among indian_restaurants servicing the phoenix area
i was there on friday_night last month to pick_up lamb_biryani that i'd ordered through phone
having eaten some really good
and bad
biryanis across many states
ca
tx
il
nc
fl etc
i didn't expect great things here
especially after seeing the reviews_on_yelp
but i still decided_to_give this place a benefit of doubt
and boy was i in for a rude surprise
the lamb_biryani
as this place calls it
consisted of a few boiled lamb pieces thrown into rice that was already mixed with some gravy
it absolutely had no taste
flavor or at least the looks to pass of as biryani
it was simply distasteful
i was so repulsed with what i got that i felt_like going back and asking the cook which fool taught him to make biryani like this
this place rightly deserves all the negative feedback its been getting lately
i've advised all my colleagues and friends never to eat here
lovely food
terrible service
just entered for lunch as the second table of the day
got water immediately from water guy
waiter saw me and started cleaning trays behind counter
mins later i made eye contact with him again and back to cleaning trays he went
mins later i left with water guy giving me a 'sorry' look as i exited
tasty lamb dishes and the garlic_naan is addicting
will be back
i love their food but i'm only giving stars because of the poor service we received today
our table was ignored for much of the meal
it took forever to get our order taken
and then when the food finally came out one of the meals was missing and the server was completely unapologetic
we waited for the last meal to come out and we saw it sitting under the heat lamps while the server was at the cash_register doing something else
finally one of us got up
walked over to her
and asked if that was his food
it was his food
and again
she was completely unapologetic
if i could have tipped less
i would have
but unfortunately gratuity was already added because we had people
well i have to admit that i am not a fan_of_indian_food with my bad experiences i've had in the past
but those past memories started to go deeper and deeper away when i at here
hence my star_review
it reality should be
stars but this is my first time here and i don't want to waste 'stars on only one try if possible
we came on a sunday_night about pm so a little late
there were still tables when we sat and i really liked the decor in the restaurant
we ordered and were greeted with great service and ordered thi chili prawns and curry chicken
both came out fast and hot
very tasty
i'm not a big_fan of indian food
but tandoori was very good
that's a lot seeing indian food is not my first choice when we go out to dinner
we will be back here
i really like this place
we had very good service
the waitress was friendly_and_helpful so we're the other employees
i ordered the special beef dish can't think of the name now but it was a bit on the spicy side which i really don't mind
this dish came with naan_bread and a delicious side salad oh and rice
they do not skimp on rice
and fyi if you order it as a side you will get the same amount as you would if it came with the special
i decided to upgrade the bread to spicy and that was pretty good too
if you are not into the spicy thing don't do it or even order the beef special i will edit the review later when i get the name of it
own the beef was so tender it just melted in my mouth
i was very pleased that i didn't have to chew meat for five hours or choke to death
please try the tandoori shrimp appetizer it is the bomb
the shrimp is very tasty and it seems grilled it has some char like it was
it lies on a bed of some grilled peppers and onions
you will receive a few sauces with your appetizers and they are very good
one is red one is green and the other is a pickled ginger kinda sauce
each one has their own unique flavors
so it is totally up to your own taste_buds
oh my friend ordered the tiki_masala dish and that was so good
the chicken was cooked_to_perfection in the beautiful curry_sauce
i think it's curry but if you eat indian food you know what i am talking_about
they say most of this food has been cooked in clay ovens
that is why it has an original old school flavor
i will tell you that i will be back
i want to try the wraps
we seen this lady across from us tearing up a wrap
and i am sold
more reviews to come
excellent lamb_biryani
not sure who wrote the opinion about it being bad
i come here especially for the lamb_biryani and onion naan
food is stars
i give overall stars because the food and booze prices are a little high for my budget
but certainly not unreasonable
hands_down the best chicken_tikka in phoenix
as good as a middle of the road restaurant in england in other words way better than anywhere_else i have found in the valley
highly_recommend you try it
service was ok
tables etc are a bit downmarket
but not offensive
food was fantastic had the paneer_tikka_masala
service was great
never needed to ask for drink refills
nice place not too loud
the food here is beyond bad
i've tried several things on the menu and found all of them to be ridiculously terrible
i'm really confused where these positive_reviews come from
i would have to assume its people who've never had english indian food before
which is definitely possible in glendale arizona
but this place should be ashamed
it's certainly not saved by at service either
no specifics but let's just say their ability to handle a disgruntled customer leaves something to be desired
just don't go here
i was very disappointed with this place
my boyfriend and i went on a thursday night and the place was almost empty
there were only other tables besides us
when we walked in there was a sign saying to wait to be seated
so we waited
and waited
finally after about minutes
one of the staff looked up from something behind the bar and noticed us
he instructed us to
sit wherever
we chose a table by a window on the north side of the restaurant
apparently a bad choice
after another minutes we were given menus
another minutes_later we were brought some water
we placed our order
we had samosas for an appetizer
they tasted ok but were very dry
they were served with
tamarind_chutney
rather than a tamarind_sauce
the chutney was mostly garbanzo beans with some fresh onion and cilantro and a tiny drizzle of tamarind_sauce
we ordered lamb_biryani and chicken_korma plus rice and naan
the naan was very good and the korma was ok
the biryani was not good
the lamb was very dry and the dish really just tasted like bell peppers
the raita was very watery and didn't add any flavor
during the meal we were ignored by the waitstaff
there were people working and they checked on the tables on_the_west_side of the restaurant times each while we were trying to flag them down for more water
both of them hung out behind the bar
one was reading the other seemed to be on the internet
we finally got more water after about minutes
then we were ignored again while the waitstaff continued to cater to the other tables
we had to flag them down again for our bill
and again to get them to take the money
never again
we've been here a few times now and every time has been great
last_night we had the chicken_tikki_masala and chicken_makhani with rice and naan
we finished that off and ordered the dessert sampler which was a great way to experience their desserts
service was great and if i could eat only one dish the rest of my life
it might just be their makhani
having lived in new delhi as a child for years
i have always been on the lookout for a good indian restaurant in the states
wherever i have lived
i even found a good one in fort wayne
indiana
for most indian_restaurants
the trend is to put out large tubs of curries and tandoori_chicken made with ready made pastes
with pre made pastes
it is impossible to get a fantastic indian meal
it must be made with fresh_ingredients
from scratch
even down to making your own cheese
it got to the point that i could not scratch that itch for the authentic tasting stuff so i started making it on my own at home
just like mexican food
the best stuff is made at home
not in the restaurants
however
the tandoori_times bistro came along in scottsdale and i had finally found my culinary nirvana
then as if prayers were being answered
tandoori_times came to glendale
their tandoori_chicken is exactly as i remembered it at modhi mahal's in delhi
as is the dal
nan
mattar_paneer
i've read a lot of mixed reviews of tt here on yelp ranging_from
beyond bad
to exquisite
i don't understand this
maybe because most americans don't know what to expect with indian food because they either think it's native american food or they've never had it in their life before
most americans already know mexican food
whether they like it or not
one thing about food from india
is that it is an ancient cuisine going back thousands of years
mexican food as we know it
tacos
enchiladas
tostadas etc
is relatively new
why is this important to know
well
even the rice is different
basmati_rice has been developed for thousands of years to get the size of grain and taste
they care about what grain of rice they use
it has to be basmati
uncle joe's brown_rice just isn't the same
sorry
this is the feeling i get from tt
they know what authentic_indian_food is and what it takes to make it and it is no trivial
slap a burger on the grill and fry it type of food
it takes days of preparation to put out the correct recipe and it doesn't come from canned pastes
this really shows up in the end result at tandoori_times and makes their somewhat high priced menu worth it if you know what really goes into making good cuisine of india
finally someone is putting in the time and effort to making really good indian food
i was pleasantly_surprised
i'm indian and so i'm always skeptical of places like this
i thought it was really good
seriously
just don't expect an indian experience it's adapted for a wider audience
tough call on this one
been there a few times and the food was great but the service every time is lacking
no attention no sense of urgency they just seem kinda bla
i don't know
if you go with lower expectations of service you will be fine
i have always enjoyed the food and never been disappointed with that
decided to try this place out with a couple of friends and we were all pleasantly_surprised
the waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and let us know if things were spicy or if they might be out of something
since our waiter told us that all of the curries are generally mild
i asked to have them make my lamb tikki_masala a little more spicy
like or on a ten point scale
and it came out perfect
to go along with the curry
we got rice and garlic_naan
which is like a flatbread super good
be warned though
the rice and naan a plate is
each
refills on the water were constant which is good because i drink a lot
oh
and they have free chai_tea there which was delicious
if i had known earlier
i would have drank that the whole time during my meal
to top the good experience off
we got the assorted desserts which was graciously given to us for free from our waiter whom i'd like to mention was easy on the eyes
overall
it was a really great experience and i would come back again
the food was average
i've had better naan and fish masala somewhere_else
one of my friend got his order wrongly token
so he waited sadly more minutes for his correct order
the belly_dancer was cool
i was a little apprehensive about eating indian food in glendale i lived in los angeles for years and had access to some pretty amazing indian food
tandoori_times is located in a strip_mall in glendale and is honestly pretty unassuming
service was pretty good our waitress was on top of things and kept our_water_glasses full and offered her suggestions when prompted
for dinner we ordered the
samosa choley
two crusty pastries stuffed with green peas potatoes served with garbanzo masala assorted chutney the pastry was cooked_to_perfection and the garbanzo bean masala was super flavorful and quite honestly the stand out of the appetizer
we also had a an order of the plain_naan and the pesto naan the stand out winner was the classic plain_naan
the chicken_tikka_masala was great the portion was a little on the small size
we ordered a lamb dish as well which was pretty good
my favorite was the goat_curry which is the special offered on fridays
if your in the area and looking for something other than your typical tgi fridays than this is a great place to explore
i always stuff myself at tt
the food is that wonderful
i live close by and have been eating here once a month for a few years now
it never fails me
even their desserts are well crafted
and the free_chai is a delight
a solid
classic neighborhood curry_house that brings a smile to my tummy whenever i visit
and i visit often
you should as well
very good indian food at a fair price
i have eaten here many times
mostly with coworkers for lunch
the food is usually above_average and the free_chai is very good
the naan is also good
i've been going here for indian food since tandoori village closed
i have not noticed any slow or bad service like some other reviewers have
their food is so amazing
you can definitely do family_style
i don't know exactly what we had
i know the bread was good
and i believe we had shrimp and coconut curry
those were fantastic
love the modern spin on the indian food
high_quality food and always good service
really good naan and dishes that will satisfy everyone
lunch is the best value because dinner is ala_carte style so dishes don't come with naan
rice
etc
this is actually our favorite indian food spot in phoenix
go here
great food
but the service is extremely
extremely
yes
double word is deserved
slow
i ordered a drink
and the service was so slow at the drink actually showed_up after the check
the drink was ordered with dinner
great food and a service
i am definitely coming_back again
we ordered the tandoori shrimp
naan garlic bread and chicken kormi
so here's how our friday_night went down at tandoori_times
arrive and walk in the door
sign says
please wait to be seated
so we wait
and wait
and wait
a few waitresses made eye contact with us
but no on really bothered coming over to welcome us
there were a couple open tables and i could have sat myself
but you know
in a new place you want to play by the rules as much as possible so we kept waiting
after about minutes a young lady came over and asked if we'd like to sit in the open table less than feet away
yes please
i responded
after sitting at an empty table for about more minutes
we still had yet to be given our menus
silverware
or even a cup of water
at this point i wanted to leave
because frankly i wasn't having the best time
fortunately our waters and menus arrived
after being in their doors for about minutes
guess what happened next
if you guessed more waiting
you're right
we say at our table with empty bellies and waters in hand
for about more minutes before our waitress returned
she asked if we were ready to order i wasn't sure if she meant drinks or food
fortunately my girlfriend was quick enough to position that we were ready with our whole order
we ordered a couple soft_drinks and all of our food
at this point i think our waitress recognized that we were a bit annoyed by our wait
and promptly returned with our soft_drinks
props to her for some mediocre situational awareness skills
our food came out maybe minutes after we ordered it
things are looking up
or so i thought
about minutes into eating
really loud hookah bar music started pumping through the speaker
then she appeared
the belly_dancer
now i've_never_seen a real live authentic belly_dancer before
so i had pretty unestablished expectations
i was a clean slate
to be as un rude as possible about her appearance it wasn't the most appetizing thing to watch while eating
frankly i wanted to tip her so that she wasn't dancing in the faces of my date and i but i think tipping would be giving her false signals
such as i enjoyed her presence
i feel like tipping a dancer
strip club style and having her stuff it in her garments somehow
is not what should be happening while eating dinner
unless i'm having the steak special at hiliter
after not finishing all the food
because i had lost my appetite
we got the check
paid and left
now i know what tandoori_times is like
i really think they could benefit from nixing the belly_dancer from the payroll and investing in a hostess instead
i'm giving it two stars
as my girlfriend was amused by my attitude about the place throughout the evening
and the food wasn't even bad
it just came with a really bad experience
well
at least she had a good time
tandoori_times has a number of locations here in the valley and i've had the good fortune of eating at this one and the one located off of i cactus
i've eaten at this location at least times as it's one of my wife's favorite restaurants
we went on a thursday night and walked in with a groupon which they readily accepted
one of the positives is that they have a full bar and a very nice wine_list which my wife appreciates
i like the full bar in case i want an old fashioned as i'm not much of a wine drinker
i ordered the lamb_vindaloo and the princess ordered the chicken_vindaloo
the dinner portions are really family_style with enough food for a couple of people so needless_to_say
we went home with leftovers
it sure didn't hurt my feelings to have to scarf that down for lunch_the_next_day
the basmati_rice is terrific
a little saffron and other spices and it's perfect with the vindaloo over the top of it
the meal comes with naan and i love naan
we buy it at costco just to have around the house
the naan here is a whole different level than what i pull out of that bag
let_me_tell_you
soft
light
and perfectly toasted
we upgraded to the chili naan which has green chilies sprinkled all over it
it's awesome
definitely worth the next or whatever it is
finished the meal with dessert
surprise
surprise
went with the rice_pudding which is of a much lighter consistency that what i would say most americans are used to
it was very good
perfect way to end the meal and cleanse my palate
which is my argument for always having dessert
it has the same flavor components as typical rice_pudding
cinnamon
raisins
a little nutmeg
just not with the custard like consistence
they seem to be gradually upgrading the restaurant with new paint and decorations
it's a very comfortable restaurant with consistently good service
i think you'll like it
if the service were as good as the food
they would have gotten four stars
first
the chef cannot make anything spicy
i don't know if he doesn't know how or he just doesn't care to
but he just cannot make a
chefs hot
dish to match a real indian chef
he sends out chili powder to the table if you want a dish hotter
really lazy and doesn't care is how it seems to me
we have tried three different times to get a spicy dish
a baby could eat this food
no heat at all
the servers are extremely slow
they have no sense of urgency
they mostly stand with their elbows on the counter staring out at the dining_room
also
check your check total
they almost always get it wrong in their favor by a few bucks
if you come in off peak
they are not happy to see you
they will let you know that you have a limited time to eat and they are closing the doors
that is a terrible business practice
for the taste of the food
you think this place would be packed
the groupon will pull you in but the service will send you running
it is a real shame what the servers do to the reputation of what could be a fine restaurant
but it is management's fault for not keeping an eye on the servers
the food was bland
the service was kind
but very slow
the naan tasted like wonder bread
i have been to many indian_restaurants
some good
and many just okay
in almost all of them
the food was better than in this place
also
there were more indian people in all of those restaurants than in this place
that should have been an early hint
i tried this place after i bought a groupon for it
i was pleasantly_surprised
the lamb_tikka_masala was awesome
the best i've had in a while
the service was good
it was very clean i liked how you can see the chefs cooking in the kitchen
i will definitely be returning
i wouldn't visit this place
i am from south_india and was disappointed with the chicken biriyani served at this place
it was just chicken pieces added to vegetable rice
the food is so good
geez the service ruins it for me everytime
slow
slow
slow
shouldnt ever have to ask for a refill on water when thats all your drinking
at the end of my meal
before asking for the check i asked for more of the yogurt stuff that comes with the biryani
took forever to get the check and when he brought it i had asked again for the sauce
upon bringing it back
he mentioned he didnt put the side on the bill
not my fault
but he said it like he was doing me a favor hahah this is not the only time ive had slow service
it just seems like they dont care at all
i am rating based_on my experience
i had been gifted a groupon from a friend and upon entry i presented it to the waiter
we were happily greeted and seated quickly
the service was nice and they were very attentive
the food was fine
it wasn't spectacular
but good
wouldn't mind coming again
but perhaps not when its busy
great food
tastes fresh and they have something for everyone
the menu has vegetarian
seafood
and meat options
the naan was fantastic and the ambiance is modern
open
and yet cozy as well
would eat again
indian food in arizona
i think tandoori_times is a solid indian restaurant for great saucy masala
soft and tender fish
hot crispy naan
and super flavorful chicken
but minus points for justin y
to receive an unpleasant bathroom experience after t
t
and the food took literally forever to come out
i really did appreciate the all you can drink self serve chai_tea
i liked it
jy didn't
pathetic service
i am an indian and i know how indian food is supposed to taste like
the food i got served was a joke
the server had the balls to argue with me and tell me that i had no idea how indian food is supposed to taste
really moron i was born and brought up in india
wish ok could give a minus rating
want to save money
never eat here
we ordered chicken_tikka
chicken_tikka_masala
chef hot
rice and naan_bread
with potatoes
and everything tasted amazing
portions were perfect for the price
our server was really nice
very satisfied with our first visit and definitely plan to return
good food
good ambiance
great location
i went to this place a long time back when they first opened
the buffet spread then was not as extensive as some of the other indian_restaurants
e
g
maharaja
however
what they lacked in food variety
they made up in taste and ambiance
and with its location on monroe street
it's hard to go wrong with this choice
my wife and i ate here as it was only a few blocks from our bed breakfast
and easy to get a table
the food was good
but not outstanding
the service was solid and yes
the ambiance was okay
for being in a miniature strip_mall plaza
the restaurant has a cozy feel to it
we had
two samosa
matar paneer and aloo chana
along with a roti
nothing stood_out as excellent
though the peas cheese definitely had a leg up on the potatoes chick_peas
the samosa were a bit chewy
but not bad
we ordered our food
medium
spice
and it was pretty hot
i feel like it's always a crap shoot in places like this are they compensating for me already
or are they talking hot is the real deal
indian hot
we typically choose
medium
and hope in this case
it was borderline too spicy
we enjoyed the food
but it was close if we return
we'll probably go with mild
the portions were plenty large enough
as is the case with most indian_restaurants
overall
the food was fine
the service was great
and we had a nice time
when we return to madison for our next visit
though
we'll probably try some different places
this is clearly the best indian restaurant in town
having moved to madison form chicago several years_ago
i bemoaned the lack of high_quality indian_restaurants
i found the local favorites to be highly over rated
that is
until taste_of_india opened
my and year_old daughters have come to love indian food as a result of regularly eating here
the lunch buffet is small
but what is offered is excellent
my preferred meal is dinner
my_favorite_dish is chili_chicken
nice and spicy
other excellent dishes include mango chicken
malai_kofta and aloo gobhi
incidentally
swagat
also relatively new
is also excellent
but taste_of_india has the edge with its location on charming monroe street
difficult to beat the buffet
the price is good and so is the food
filling
good flavor
replenished frequently
and good variety
the sauce can be a bit heavy and thick but that is necessary at a buffet to keep the food from drying out in the heated hotel pans
really
nothing bad to say
wish i could visit more often
i had the lunch buffet here
it was very good
and reasonably_priced
for all_you_can_eat
the bread was outstanding
some of the hot food was a little on the heavy side
too buttery for me
the spices were good
the dishes were strongly seasoned but with some subtlety and complexity
none of the food here was even remotely spicy
in a hot pepper sense
though
why five_stars
more hot spicy good
and less heavy on the dishes
i also was less than impressed by an eggplant_dish and a few other dishes that were a little on the bland side
but overall
the food here was great
and the bread was really good
desserts were also very good very flavorful and spiced just right
amazing food
great service
great prices
great buffet for lunch and quick take out
i love_this_place
i wanted put zero but yelp does not allow
worst place ever
the owner is rude an thinks that he owns the world
we went in once there
the waiter made us sit and wait only to be told that they don't serve what we wanted
and the to top it all the owner says he didnt have time
seriously i don't know how the food was but in no case can the owner be rude
would never advise anyone to go here
worst place
i came one day for the lunch buffet as it was my first time eating indian food
lunch is buffet only
the food was very good and fresh
i highly enjoyed the multiple dishes i had
would def
go back again
went for dinner last_night
it had been awhile since i'd ventured over to taste_of_india
and i believe the last couple_of_times i had the lunch buffet
dinner was thoroughly great
their chutneys are fresh
seem to be housemade
and flavorful
i had the lamb madras chunks of lamb in a rich sauce redolent of ginger
curry and coconut
it was really tasty
the lamb was a bit tougher than i expected
but still good
i appreciated the server's suggestion that i order it a notch spicier than usual
as otherwise the sweetness of tamarind overwhelms the other flavors
we split the spinach naan very plentiful basket for
my boyfriend has a standard order nearly every time we eat indian food
he loves the tandoori mixed_grill
although taste_of_india serves theirs with raita
and not masala curry_sauce as other establishments in madison do
he proclaimed theirs the best he's had in madison
a steaming mound of tandoori_chicken
fish
shrimp
and seekh kabob atop surprisingly flavorful red green bell peppers and onions even with a little help from me
we took over half of it home
at
that's a steal
the fish was something one doesn't see nearly enough of on the tandoori mixed_grill
and it was a standout
well worth the trek from east_side to west
right down to clean and festive decor and little touches like silver chutney spoons and antique tureens containing my curry
mmmm
my wife and i were long overdue for a date_night
we had some coupons to choose from and kathy decided on taste_of_india
we arrived just before the dinner rush kicked in
we went with the non vegetarian dinner for
rice pullao and fresh onion chutney
mint_chutney
tamarind_sauce
chicken pakora
chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_curry
tandoori_chicken and nan and gulab_jamun dessert
the food came out in courses
chicken pakora app
the entre items
then dessert
too much for the of us to finish so we brought the leftovers home to enjoy
the service was attentive
but not bothersome
and the food was very good
we will_be_going_back
my family and i come here so much for the lunch buffet that they know us
i love their lamb masala and chicken_tika_masala
great nan and samosas
i don't know if it's all that authentic
but it sure is tasty
our go to indian place for dine in or take out
lots of tasty food attentive staff
food is delicious
i've never had to wait in line or for service
the wait_staff is very polite and make great recommendations
it is great little gem and one of madison's best kept secret restaurants there aren't many of those
this place is cozy and i enjoy it over and over again
taste_of_india is the real deal
they are careful to maintain their buffet and replenish frequently
the quality of every dish is treated as important
and it shows
they have a lot of the standards
but after several visits
we find it one of the two best in madison
best gulab jammon anywhere
service is also well done
never a wait
even the buffet service is carefully maintained
this is a simple place
but very well done
my go to india place in madison
flavors are all there and the service is spot on
take out is fast and dinning in is a pleasure
good nice staff as well
went here friday_night
it's a fairly small place
with seating for maybe about ish people
and i'd say they were about half full
so
no wait_for_a_table
and we had quick and attentive service
we ordered the samosas
goat_curry
spinach paneer
both at
medium
spiciness
regular naan
and garlic_naan
along with a couple of kingfisher beers
the spinach paneer was really excellent
creamy
thick
and with just_the_right_amount_of heat and seasoning
the samosas were pretty standard
though especially good because of how right out of the fryer crispy they were
the naan was just fine
the goat_curry was the only disappointment
with not nearly as much meat as i would have liked expected
especially at around
next time i might stick to veggie_options
my favorite indian place
although we eat there often
my husband and i always get the same thing
we share the vegetarian platter
mixed appetizers
mmmm
and i get the paneer_tikka
ahh
the yogurt_sauce
while he has lamb pasanda
it's so good we don't want to get anything else
recently
we ordered take out with friends
and we also tried their chicken_makhani
it was much pinker than other chicken_makhani i've had
and made
and tasted a little different
it kind of looked like chicken_vindaloo or tandoori_chicken
but anyway it was really good
creamy and flavorful but not too spicy
the service at the restaurant is always fantastic
they constantly refill your water glasses and the food comes quickly
no surprise that even though it is off the beaten path
it is almost always crowded
someday i hope to try their buffet so we can branch out a little
great food
pleasant service and very fresh weekend buffet with a wide_selection_of choices
the carrot dessert is insane
and they're very nice to kids here
for some odd reason we haven't stopped into this restaurant which coincidentally is down the street from our home
that won't happen again
although i've made curry and
indian
dishes in the past
this gives me something to shoot for the next time my wife and i cook
service
food
presentation
all that
we had the vegetarian dinner for two that fit everything we were looking for on a cool spring evening in madison
wi
although off the main drag on monroe street
this place is worth your time and money
the service is okay
not great
the selection is not that many though they have coconut ice_cream in addition to their mango one
the taste is not spectacular either
i was a bit disappointed that the waiter didn't come to fill up our glasses until i asked them to do so
not sure if we want to be back
other place offers a much better choice
solid indian food in madison which is tough to come by
portions are a little small for the price in regards to the dinner menu
yum
great indian food on monroe st
my pick_up experience was quick and easy
i called in my order outside and my food was ready in about ten_minutes
being somewhat of a rice freak
i asked for an extra portion after i realized they only provided a small togo package of rice
they were nice and gracious enough to provide extra rice at no additional charge
my roasted eggplant_dish was delicious with the right amount of heat
the naan was very soft and tasty
i had enough for dinner and saved leftovers for lunch_the_next_day
i suspect that i might be picking_up dinner here more than once
while i am in madison
most definitely a fan
this is my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in madison
i love lunch buffet
there are a lot of delicious vegetarian choices
lentil soup
samosas
vegetable_korma
saag_paneer
they provide great service too
one time they did not have saag_paneer and my year_old was very disappointed
they responded by making it special for her
monroe street was busy today and all of the restaurants were packed for lunch
bluphie's is pretty mediocre
so we decided to try taste_of_india
we had the lunch buffet
which offered typical indian dishes
it had everything i wanted and expected
and it all tasted good
the service was very good too
waters were refilled quickly and my coffee cup was refilled multiple_times without even asking for refills
staff members weren't too chatty
but when paying our bill they were very kind
the restaurant was clean and nicely_decorated
it's a solid bet if you are in the mood for indian food
this is my family's favorite indian place in madison
the food is always delicious
and the staff remember us and out usual orders and we are treated like family
you can also order carry_out and the food is just as good
the decor is a little outdated
the carpet could use an update
maybe i don't like indian food
but i just don't like this place
my boyfriend has forced me a few times to go to the lunch buffet
the service usually sucks
we never get soda refills
one of the desserts tasted like pinesol
it was really weird and we made our friends try it because of how dead on it was
the second location of bombay_spice is now open
it's conveniently located on the north west corner of tatum and shea in the whole foods soma cafe shopping_center
i went with a group of on tuesday night for dinner and out of of us loved it
sorry again
marc i felt awful that we all enjoyed and you did not
let me explain
since i'd been to the th street location before
i suggested bombay_spice to mix things up a bit
the group i was with are pretty healthy health conscious so i thought they may enjoy indian food done healthy
we shared the chickpea_ceviche as an appetizer and then most of us ordered the different rice bowls as entrees
we had fun with the variety of sauces too
favorite choices included the cauliflower
eggplant
chicken_tikka_masala
and veggie tofu tikka as well as the mint
hot
and curry sauces
unfortunately
marc is allergic to onions and everything he attempted to order had onions in it
by the time he placed an order for plain chicken and rice
we were all almost done and the kitchen was slammed and didn't prioritize his order
as they should have
so
marc didn't eat
i will return for sure for the food it's prepared for the health conscious eater and it is not as heavy as traditional_indian food i happen to like that
note
if you are allergic or really hate onions
be careful about ordering so you don't starve like my friend marc did
stars for the food with an additional star for originality
service and decor
we were a bit hesitant to try bombay_spice after reading mr k's review on their first location
it seems that the owners have taken mr k's advice to heart and upped the level of spice
bombay_spice offers a healthy interpretation of indian food by not deepfrying
not using butter
ghee
clarified butter
or cream
unfortunately this means that the samosa loses all crunch with the filling steaming up the outer pastry
the potato filling was nicely spiced but that still didn't make up for the soft exterior
the chickpea_ceviche a grander name for the indian street snack bhel_puri on_the_other_hand would have benefited from more spices
the pappadums that are offered with it is a nice crispy contrast to the cool and tangy combination of chickpeas
cucumbers
tamarind
mint and coriander
not sure why i ordered the seared scallops in landlocked phoenix
i still remember spike on top chef this season madly drying his frozen scallops and still did not manage get the crispy outer sear on his scallops
similarly these had a nice dark sear but the exterior was not in the least bit crispy
the veggie skewer accompanying it had nice smokiness from being chargrilled
the lamb_chops or more appropriately lamb lollipops on_the_other_hand was overly spiced
we wish it was served with some starch or even a few slices of cucumber for contrast
a great alternative to the usually heavy indian food
i will definitely give them another try in hopes that they get their spicing under control
i love the decor and the way the chef came out to describe food reminded us of ourselves at our ice_cream shop
hooray for independents with innovative original concepts
first
i love that bombay is walking distance from our house
great wine_list of bottles and all at a glass or a bottle
i can't wait to work my way through the list
martinis
cosmos also available
fresh lime juice for the margaritas were outstanding
i could drink them everyday with a great tequila
wink to mike
i'll keep my fingers crossed
we had the chickpea_ceviche
beef tikka
lamp chops
rice_pudding
yum
we enjoyed all of the sauces
i love the chai_tea
i used to drive thru coffee bean now i stop by bombay_spice and get one to go for half the price
and it taste better
the quality is outstanding and healthy
the price is right and the staff is warm and friendly
thanks for being our new neighbor bombay_spice
i've driven by their other location about a million times and i've always said
we've got to try that place someday
well
last weeked
after arguing a bit about where to eat
a typical conversation at my house
we pulled in here on the way home from the shop
i am so glad that it is on the way home from work
this was one of the best meals we had in a long time
the restaurant is pretty new
and you can still tell at a new place
the staff is abundant
there appeared_to_be two hostesses for this small seater
and everything is hyper clean
i loved the decor simple
yet bright and cheerful
although the homemade school project art was a letdown
the menu
once explained
was interesting
we both had combination plates so we could sample different flavors and sauces and we had a blast eating off of each other's plates
the beef tikka was probably our favorite
the curry isn't too strong
but the curry_sauce added a bit of punch and heat that seemed to be missing from the dish itself
this probably helps those diners who are spice a phobic
but we could have taken a little extra oomph
overall though
it was a great meal and very affordable considering all the food we enjoyed
the wine menu was great too we'll_definitely_be_back
congrats to the owners and staff for hitting a home run
mmm
delicious indian food and a great selection of vegetarian_dishes
i love the fact that each dish is mildly spiced
and left up to the individual to customize the flavor depending_on which sauces they choose
i'm a spicy lightweight so it was great that i didn't have to worry_about getting something too hot to enjoy
i had a bowl of brown_rice
cumin potatoes and tofu masala with a cool yogurt cucumber mint sauce on the side
it was fantastic
i can't_wait_to_go_back
also
i thought it was adorable that we were given a golden dollar coin with our check for
making the drive to their location and to compensate for high gas prices
a memorable gesture
i have to say i used to be really scared of indian food
no longer
my first time with indian food was definitely a pleasant one
i thought the food was very good and not too spicy
and right now they are doing this golden dollar campaign where they give you a dollar for coming to the restaurant because they think that is the amount of gas money you spent getting there
how nice and conscientious of you bombay_spice
i met a friend here for lunch today because i needed to get out of the house
thank you kylee if you are reading this
i also had a craving for indian
now
i'm also trying to watch what i eat so bombay_spice seemed to be a good option
let's get one thing out of the way
if indian food was a bike
this would be a tricycle
or something with training wheels
meaning
this isn't authentic_indian_food
that said
it's very good
and very healthy
it's a little light on spice but the food still has good flavor
they have shakers of garam masala and another spice mix that has red chiles in it but the name escapes me
additionally
the entrees come with raita and a choice of another spice so if you'd like more heat
order the hot_sauce which i did
it provided the extra heat i was looking for
i got the shrimp tikka masala and the eggplant with a side of brown_rice
a papadum
and a whole_wheat chappti
huge freaking portions of the rice and eggplant
the shrimp was disappointing
just three shrimp swimming in a sea of sauce
now
the sauce was good but three
come on
give me a little more
my dining companion had the chicken_tikka_masala and cumin potatoes
her portions were equally as big
she also ordered the tamarind_sauce which was nice
almost a bit like teriyaki sauce
all of the food came out within minutes of us ordering
i also enjoyed the wine_list
glass are
flights are
and a bottle is
our server also said that we could order a bottle and if we didn't finish it they'd cork it and let us take it
one thing i particularly like about bombay_spice is the ability to order online
i hate ordering on the phone because it always seems like a recipe for disaster
you never get what you ordered
the ability to order online is also a life saver when you're like me
frequently stuck on a teleconference but desperately hungry
i left happy and full
and i can't wait to return here with my family and friends
i highly_recommend bombay_spice for people who have never experienced indian food but are curious about it
this is not an indian food place
this is a faux indian food
bland food with no gravy
just be aware that this is not indian food
i'm not trying to be rude or offend anyone but a lot of non indians are making comments about this place as if they are getting genuine indian food
that would be the equivalent of someone eating at taco bell and then saying they had great mexican food
yes
the food is not heavy because
it's not indian food
the owner is a multi millionaire engineer who opened this place with the intent of appealing to the mainstream
in short
this is the pf changs of indian food
it's designed to appeal to non indians
the food is deliberately less seasoned to appeal to palates that can't withstand spicy food
the food has also has several contemporary american twists on it to also appeal to the mainstream
there is nothing wrong with that but bombay_spice should not be approached as an indian restaurant but rather a swank a little indian american fusion eatery
if you want to try something different that is still tasty
check it out
if you just moved here and are craving good ole fashioned indian food
check out royal taj
guru palace
and dehli palace
i think the best thing about this place is the bread
everything else is average and if you want authentic cuisine
this is not it
but its not heavy
the service was not great
although i think the workers tried hard
they just seemed understaffed
i was surprised on how good the hummus was at bombay_spice
having never seen hummus on the menu of an indian food restaurant
i was curious to try it out
the hummus had a good consistency and it was yummy on the naan_bread
bombay_spice offers many dishes for vegetarians
the potatoes
lentils
and rice are all good
the prices are a little high for everyday dining
but the happy_hour specials are great
gr little place
live so close by
wanted to try for ages
glad i finally did
happy hr is fabby
wines tappas
luved the chickpea_ceviche y u m
chicken skewers go well with above
twin humus plate was a nice change
kids menu w drink w o w
will definately be back
first
i don't give four stars easily
but this place deserves it
indian food is tough in any city
most of it greasy
and undistinguished
this place was really good
why
first
it was very fresh
not greasy
but authentic
the chicken
beef and lamb tikkas
skewers
were terrific
all the sauces were excellent
the chapati bread was whole_wheat
warm and very nice
paratha
stuffed bread w chix and potatoes were also excellent
hot chai_tea very good as well
not too sweet
there were only two of us so we could only sample a few dishes
but we will return with friends
all the dishes being served to other diners looked excellent
in very hip cities
ny vancouver there is a trend toward modern indian_cuisine
much like bombay_spice
give it a try
definitely
this food is amazing
they have a great happy_hour
i haven't had a bad experience yet
do not come here if you want indian_cuisine
i should have read other reviews more closely
do i really want hummus or ceviche at an indian restaurant
this place is more for wine and tapas
the decor is very hip and trendy but i dine out for the food and i thought the food was bland and tasteless
entrees were high at each plate and comes dishes served with rice and chapati bread
wheat tortilla
food arrived not hot
my friend had vegetarian curry
veggies had that frozen food rubbery texture
cumin potatoes were sour
my chicken keema and chicken_tikka_masala was bland and niether dish had flavor
my basmati_rice was clumpy and sticky
i did not like the ginger green tea
it tasted like licorice
i dunno
maybe i'm too harsh and narrow minded
i did feel underwhelmed and disappointed
the food is not amazing
i came in expecting allot but it just didn't live up to what i thought the flavors would be with a name like bombay_spice
the prices on the wine are great but the menu is a bit confusing and the food has potential but it needs allot of work
i'm a big_fan of indian culture and food but it's not terrible but there is other places that have great indian food that i would rather go
overall i give it about a
save your time and money this place is not worth_the_trip
have you ever had one of those experiences where you saunter out of a restaurant after your first visit there and you think
gee
not bad
i'll be back
and then the next day you mention the restaurant to friends and they shoot you down
not such a great place after all
they convince you
well
in hindsight i see that my friend was right about the food here being on the bland side
yes
it does seem to be prepared with your arteries in mind
but what is indian food without creamy richness and sweat inducing spice
i give bombay_spice kudos for the innovative plating and for allowing you to order two entrees for the price of one
the happy_hour is a terrific idea
and i might be back just for the appetizers and wine
tough call
indian food with the gloves on
might be an appropriate description
first and foremost i'm going to give it to them for their cleanliness
indian_restaurants are traditionally holes in the wall that serve food so tasty that you ignore some of the blatantly unhygenic details
bombay_spice is very clean which is nice for a change
the food
not bad
think
bistro indian
sort of the place i'd take my relatives that would be worried about eating something
international
everything was flavorful but somehow seemed watered_down
staff was nice and the menu offered a broad array of great sounding dishes
i would probably go back if people i knew wanted to go but if i were by myself i'd go try and find an indian place that packs a more flavorful punch
my advice is to give it a shot and go during happy_hour so you can try a few of their half price starters before making the full commitment because the prices aren't exactly cheap
stopped by here yesterday at happy_hour
had a late lunch so a friend i shared the carrot souflee
it was good but not quite what we were picturing
guess we should've asked
and a couple glass_of_wine
at happy_hour
regularly
all the wines are glass or bottle
even on wines that cost quite a bit more at other restaurants
the service was a little on the slow side
but very friendly
also really like the atmosphere
lime green white and black looks clean and modern but warm
the outside seating_area also looked really nice
will definitely try it again for dinner soon
ate once
will_never_go_back
the food has no flavor
it is fine to make an attempt at healthy food
but you cannot substitute real butter ghee with vinegar to kick flavor up
all the curries had a muddy consistency and vinegary after taste
how can you screw up rice
it tasted stale
the grains were broken up like it was from a bag century old this was not basmati
this was the worst of both worlds
but the public relations about
healthy
will fool the
naturally
endowed botox silicone crowd of scottsdale
good food
good service
good prices
that's all i want out of a restaurant
there are reviews here that say bombay_spice isn't necessarily authentic_indian_food
maybe it's not
so what
i honestly wouldn't know authentic_indian_food if it bit me
it still tasted good
taco bell isn't authentic mexican food either but sometimes it still tastes good
all i can say is that i liked the food at bombay_spice and there was a decent vegetarian section
i'll definitely go back
if you like indian flavors and aren't a snob about perfect indian cooking
give this place a shot
edit a few months later i'm moving them up to stars
i've been to bombay_spice a few more times for lunch and the food is great every time
menu overhaul did the trick for this place much better than when they first opened
new veg curry
naan
and more are good additions
and when you request it spicy hot they actually cook it that way
rather than sending it to you mild with a side of red pepper flakes like they did last year
nice contemporary feel
menu is still awkward for indian_cuisine
people unfamiliar with indian food probably won't care
but devout consumers of indian food like me are annoyed when they make the menu so non traditional
want your chana in a bowl
plate
or wrap
modest wine selection is a nice improvement over what you'll find at traditional indian_restaurants
portions are somewhat small
as a health nut bombay_spice doesn't really satisfy all of my requirements
i would like to see organic produce meats and wild fish shrimp utilized in the cuisine
but alas this is still a tasty healthy ish place to eat
the shrimp_curry lettuce wraps are really tasty as is the naan
which again i wish was organic
they do use olive oil
as opposed to trans fat or something rancid like canola oil
so that is an awesome start
i would say stars for taste and for being one of the healthiest indian places i have come across
of course if health is not at all a concern of yours the food here tastes phenomenal
i went for the lunch_special i wanted to try it out
first of all the lunch plate was
i had the beef tikka masala and veggie curry
the dishes were okay
i am glad i asked them to make it hotter because the hot seemed to be more of a medium so i can't imagine how mild the masala is normally
as for the flavors
they were okay
the menu states that it is fresh
healthy
incredible indian cusine
i guess one out of is not bad
maybe
i need to give it another shot
two words
chickpea_ceviche
it's tasty and sweet
i love indian food
i'm constantly driving through this intersection and have always wanted to try it
i finally got the chance and on top of that it was lunchtime and their sign said
lunch_specials
i arrived around am and the place is empty
i ordered the
dinner
portion as i was sharing with my child
for chicken curry chicken_tikka_masala
i also ordered a side of plain_naan
the entree came with a
row
of rice that separated the two choices i made
the rice tasted like something that came from uncle bens no flavor and every time i scooped up rice there was a lot of water soaked rice underneath
the chicken curry and chicken masala tasted the same
one was red the other wasn't
again
very little flavor
how can indian food lack so much flavor
the naan was just a flat_bread
nothing important about it
but it vaguely reminded_me_of the frozen naan they sell at trader joe's
and when i started thinking about it
so did the curry masala
i ended_up spending over dollars for my meal that i shared with my young child
i felt_like i could have gotten the same thing at trader joe's sans the watery rice for about
i gave this place two stars
just based_on the great service the waitress gave and another for it trying to be a healthy indian restaurant
trust
go to the indian buffet in the airpark
although it's the real deal
it's worth the money and calories
bland
and
watery
are not words you want to spring to mind when you are eating indian food
unfortunately
these are the two words that best described my meal from bombay_spice
being vegetarian
i was excited_to_see the number of different vegetarian_options on the menu
and i was pleased to see that you got two choices for the lunch_special priced at
this came with rice
brown or white
and either roti or lettuce
confused as to why they offered this i would rather a small side salad rather than a plain chunk of iceberg lettuce
i also ordered garlic_naan for an extra
i ordered the spinach and tofu
normally this dish is served with paneer an indian cheese that has a texture like tofu but has a richer flavor
and the vege curry
eggplant was not on the lunch_special menu otherwise i would have tried that
the food came quickly
but unfortunately
it was really just watery and bland
they also kind of scrimped on the rice portion
the naan was
ok
but i've had waaaay better elsewhere
the food had none of the spices or flavors you would expect from indian food
i understand toning down the heat to cater to american palates
but this just didn't taste of anything
i had a more flavorful curry at my chinese restaurant the other night
and i've had better curry frozen from trader joes
i was also not asked if i wanted the food mild
medium
or hot never a good sign at an indian
or thai
restaurant
to me it implies they are too lazy to cook the food to order
actually if it was sitting in a vat for several hours
that should improve the flavor but clearly they are not using the right spices because i couldn't taste any
despite the name of the restaurant
i will_not_be_returning to bombay_spice
don't waste your money here
well
at least the owner is consistent
as with roka akor
this place had great style in the decor
but the food just was not very good
we ordered chicken_tikka_masala and a curry
both of the sauces were flavorful and balanced
but none of the flavors penetrated the meats in the curries
it almost tasted like the curry was cooked in one pot
the meat was boiled in water and the meat was dropped into the curry at the last minute
maybe its the old school in me
but its such a waste to order a meat dish and leave the meat behind
the search continues for good indian food in my hood
what a great alternative to indian food with all those really heavy cream based sauces
btw
i love them
but they can get kind of fatty
bombay_spice reminds you that you can do indian
go light
and still have a really good meal
i always get the lamb_chops as an appetizer
they are freaking delicious
entrees you can mix and match different types
what style
bowl
roti tacos
plate
etc
i ususaly get chicken keema and lentils
all the entrees have good flavor
some spice
i like to ask for more
and are nice and filling
but not in a heavy way
service has been mixed from super_nice waitresses who would fit in at any star place to surly and unattentive ones who need to be flagged down for even the basics
like drinks
ordering
asking for check
refills
update
i went there the other night with my wife and two kids
and mo
there were at least tables open and the manager
owner
came over and told us that there were no tables available
none of them could be combined into a table for four
it was pm
i call bs
there weren't any kids there and she gave_us a good look up and down then shook her head no
we've been there at least a dozen times with the kids
we order lots of food
tip well and our kids don't disturb anyone
we eat out every night of the week
they are both model citizens
i know the look that i got
we weren't welcome there
don't worry
we wont be coming_back
ever
there's no shortage of good food in this town
we can find plenty of places that aren't afraid to see a young family walk in
good lamb_chops aren't worth being disrespected
we love_this_place
we found it by chance when we came last year to look for a house
indian food can be very buttery and fat laden
aka delicious
bombay_spice adds a
healthier
flair to indian food that we love
you can get things with lettuce wraps instead of rice
my wife likes that their dishes are less greasy than other restaurants
not to harp on them too much
but some can get that way just because the method you have to make the meat or sauce
check it out sometime
the worst you can say is you didn't like it
but if you like indian
i think you'll love bombay_spice
the food is fantastic
it's a healthy alternative to most indian food
my husband and i have always enjoyed the food
the service
however
consistently awful
my husband and i don't complain a lot and we know the service industry is tough
plan to be there for an_hour and a half to hours if go for dinner
drinks never refilled
waited minutes after we already finished our appetizers for the server to take our order for dinner
we essentially bussed our own tables
plan to not see your server during and after you eat
plan to wait to get your check
we likely will not go back because of the terrible service
ate here on a trip
it was pretty much the only indian place around
so we gave it a shot
decor ambiance c
it's clean
but pretty small and boring
sterile
for lack of a better term
service c
pretty average server and timeliness
food c
in total we ordered the chickpea_ceviche
sauce taster
garlic_naan
samosas
and most of the vegetarian entrees
everything was ok
nothing bad
but also nothing great
i've had indian food that was light
but still tasty
this was light
but bland
so
it's not bad at all
but it's also pretty ho hum
surprisingly good
as i am not a fan_of_indian_food
the service was good
and attentive
i asked for and received a sample tasting of the featured masala sauce
we both enjoyed our meals
but they do need to get rid of the
guys
thing
this place touts healthy indian food i've never heard of such a thing
was pleasantly_surprised with my dinner
ordered the plate with lamb_curry and chicken_tikka_masala
the lamb pieces were nice and tender and the flavor was great
the chicken_tikka_masala was not as rich as i'm used to but it too had good flavor
both were quite spicy and made me appreciate the dollop of raita which was served with the meal
i liked that they gave you the choice of brown_rice or basmati
the healthy spin was definitely an upside but it took away from the full potential of flavor
service was ok
they weren't that busy while i was there but the servers chatted amongst themselves until they were waived down
food was good but if_you're_looking for a traditional_indian meal this isn't the place for you
this is definitely not traditional
true indian food
we ordered naan and received
pita_bread warmed up and sliced in quarters
the nerve
to label something on the menu as naan and then serve pita_bread that looked like it just came out of a bag from whole foods
and today they were out of chicken_tikka
gasp
sigh
the chicken masala was bland
but the chicken curry was tasty but not noteworthy
the chickpea_ceviche was good
the service was attentive and responsive
i would suggest to try it at lunchtime to save and try a few things to see if you might like it
food was great
the service could_have_been_better but wasn't horrible
quiet location
i was told a while back to try bombay_spice
my husband and i are changing our lifestyle by eating healthy
this is a great option for anyone looking for a healthy alternative
i liked the option to have brown_rice or lettuce wraps
they also have tofu
which is difficult_to_find at most places
we tried the sauce sampler
seared salmon
chicken_tikka_masala
veggie curry
and chicken curry
everything was very good
was a great change from the usual chain restaurants
absolutely_delicious indian_fare
can even get completely vegan
it's small inside
but they turn tables quick so you shouldn't have to wait long
for our own food
we waited only a few minutes before we had piping_hot
tasty curry on our table
we had the chickpea_ceviche
recommended by our server
for an app and it was so fresh and cool and crisp tasting
then onto the bombay plate
picks of entrees with lettuce wraps and each thing we had was sooooo good
spinach and tofu
vegetable_curry
eggplant curry
vegetable makki
and lentils
came with a little roti bread and we tore into it
for desert
we could only the sorbet since the other options had allergy inducing pistachios
but it was a nice cool
rich tasting treat
our server was severely genuine and sincere
and made_us_feel like valued customers
of course
she was from alabama so we would've expected nothing less
a pleasure to have her taking care of us
a great place and i know we'll_be_back here
bucks for two with large apps
a large entree
and desert
so being the foodie that i am i am always down to try new places
this place had a table at the last yelp event i went to with my fiance and we really enjoyed it so we thought we would go in and give it a try
i thoroughly_enjoyed everything that we tried and it all lived up to what i know about indian_cuisine
spicy and good
the only thing i disliked about this place is that the service_was_a_bit_slow
they only had one waitress working the whole place in the middle of lunch rush
which i thought was a bit ridiculous considering that there were tables with people at them
seemed like a bit much for one girl even though this place is a bit small and you had to wait quite a while for your refills
besides that the waitress was very friendly and informative
i would not go out of my way to go eat here again but definitely enjoyed the food and atmosphere
more like half stars
so after my negative review
i was offered a chance by the restaurant to come and re try their food
i responded via email to the manager
never heard back
way to add salt to the wound
tried bombay_spice last_night
after reading the website and reviews
it seemed like it would fit perfectly our combined need to finally find good indian_fare in phoenix and not blow our calorie budget
husband and i are trying and succeeding
in losing weight
success on both counts
it was saturday at about
and we_were_seated_immediately
the place was almost full
we sat on the patio
which was lovely
but might get too hot during the summer
i didn't see any misters you're welcome
mother earth
service was attentive
and our waitress gave_us several recommendations
we ordered
somosas
baked
i think
not fried
which made them a little messier to eat but still very very tasty
naan
chewy
moist
naan y
yum
grilled shrimp skewers
a little on the skimpy side
but very tasty
and served with grilled peppers and onions and a delightful mint sauce
we each ordered individual entrees with basmati
they encourage you to order the two entree choice
but we were trying to avoid over ordering
and it turned_out_to_be exactly the right amount of food
i ordered the cauliflower and potatoes
which was moist
savory
a little spicy
and very tasty
albeit lacking a little in the sauce department
i would have liked a little something to spoon over my rice
husband ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
which was exceptional
they claim that they don't use cream in their food
so i don't know how they made the masala sauce so creamy and good
but they did and i'm not going to question it any more
i would have licked the bowl if we had been at home
next time i think we'll get some apps again but try the bombay plate to share
which is entree choices and rice
that way we can try a whole bunch of things
before tip for naan
two appetizers
and two single choice entrees
not bad for a saturday out
we'll_definitely_be_back
even though it was kind of a drive for us
definitely not authentic_indian_food
felt_like fast_food indian food at best
service and atmosphere were just ok
i don't consider bombay_spice an authentic indian restaurant
more of a modern and healthier version of the indian_cuisine
i appreciate their healthy take and their vast vegan and gluten_free options
i have been to bombay about five or six times over the course of the last year
and have eaten some of their items at yelp events
i have never disliked any of the items i have tried
but there have certainly been a few items i found less than flavorful
vegetable lentil soup
cauliflower
spicy veggie curry
last week i tried the seared tofu
and it was absolutely_amazing
it is an appetizer
but comes with five or six good sized slices of tofu
and i would eat it as a meal
i also fell in love with the delicious tofu masala
i couldn't be happier with either of those selections and highly_recommend them
i also like that you get to choose two menu_items and have it served in a variety of ways
plated with rice
lettuce wraps
roti taco
etc
it gives a little extra variety depending_on your mood
one complaint i have is that they do not know which wines are vegan
to have a separate menu focusing on vegan entrees and to not know what complimentary drinks are also vegan leaves me a little dissatisfied
overall
bombay has good service
a good location next to whole foods
progressive menu_items
is moderately priced
and has a good variety of items available for vegans and carnivores alike
yes
the previous reviewers are right
not an authentic indian
however it is a very good place
we really enjoyed the paratha naan and the lentil tower
i had the salmon and it was nicely seasoned
chris was very nice to let us try the other sauces
i am a sauce person so i loved the tamarid sauce that comes with the paratha naan and the somosas
we would be here every other day if it wasn't because it is a little bit too far for us
went here with a party of last_night
tuesday
at about pm
the place was mostly empty with just a few diners eating
the decor is modern
neat and clean if that makes sense to anybody
it wasn't over the top and you probably couldn't tell this was an indian food place by looking at the decor at all
i am beginning to like indian_cuisine and its good that there is a place like bombay_spice that makes it healthier
this is good because i had no idea that
regular
indian food was unhealthy
oops
i've been meaning to try this place for a while and by chance i found it on local dines so i snatched up a cert for
http
bit
ly dfr eq
definitely a solid find for a solid place and worth it because their food isn't very expensive to begin with
anyway
the service was excellent and the food came out quickly
here is what i sampled
caesar salad this was weird and i'm glad i tried it but i wouldn't get it again
it was just romain lettuce tossed with some weird caesar like dressing
our waitress said it was a weird salad but i wanted it anyway
sauce sampler w naan_bread this was just ok
it was worth it though to try their sauces
nothing to special about it
lentil soup i didn't like this
it was really thick and weird
tikka skewers peppers
onions and chicken stir fried
this was pretty good
beef tikka masala
chicken curry
spinach and tofu
and chicken keema all of this was very good
i got of the above and sampled the rest off of the other plates of my party
my only real issue is that the food lacked a certain kick or pizazzz
i guess that's what all the unhealthy stuff that other places use adds to the dish
i don't know
it just wasn't as flavorful as i would have liked
i would order the stuff again though
perhaps next time i will kick it up a noch with some of that stuff on the table that looks like cinnamon but later learned it was some hot spice stuff
i will be back soon to try more of their stuff
i can't believe the average rating isn't higher for this place
my only real complaint about it is that it's so far away
especially now that they closed their other location
i got hooked on contemporary indian food not too long ago
and bombay_spice does it well
shame on me for thinking the other reviewers were just picky about their indian food
everything you'll read here is consistent with what has been said before
the food is
healthy
indian style
it's okay
but definitely lacks the authentic flavor that traditionally bursts off your plate when you eat indian_cuisine
the naan was more like pita_bread and the curry seriously tasted like stew
the tikki_masala sauce although not as good as the traditional was good enough to eat as an alternative
if you're going to go to bombay_spice
go for lunch
it's just not that exiting of a venue to waste on dinner
even though the food was just okay
the service was great
so i can't possibly rate them at less than a star
after all they did deliver
healthy
indian food as promised
it's okay
like the vegan aspect
using tofu in place of paneer is not a good substitute
i'd rather go without than have the tofu in there
it's just not the right texture
spice_level was ok
could have had more flavor
heat_level was fine
the
veggie based
rather than cream sauces they tout are a great idea
but sit walk by the kitchen and look around
you'll see big jars of veggie stock base
you know what that stuff is
salt
more salt
msg
yeast extract
and some veg flavor
c'mon
if you're trying to do healthy then why base all your sauces on fake flavored salt paste and pass it off as a healither option
honestly
i'd rather have the full fat
cream laden version that tastes so much better
at least it was natural
reviews of this place were pretty decent on yelp
but i thought this place was pretty good
granted
i gather it's not as authentic as some other indian_restaurants
this place still holds it's own
maybe it's the spice_level
well needless_to_say your food should only be so spicy
my masala ck's spice was perfect for me
i can handle a few peppers
but i must say too much is ridiculous milk please
the ambience is neat
the fresh green wall on the bar really brightens the joint and the wine lined up to the top of the ceiling is a great design call
our service was okay and that's all i'll say enjoy
i went with my young son last_night to check out the new menu
and i loved it
i ordered the chickpea_curry over brown_rice
spicy
it was absolutely_delicious
and is alone a good reason to return
we also ordered the lentil patty appetizer
which was good
although not my favorite
they serve a
masala
black iced_tea which was unusual and delicious
my son ordered from the kids meal
a backup
just in case
and he chose baked chicken fingers which came with a side of fruit cocktail and a full sized drink
overall
the food was a modern
healthy version of my favorites
with courteous and attentive customer_service in a beautifully decorated space
four stars because i want to try more of their menu
make sure service and quality stay consistent
and because they were inexplicably playing a steve miller band greatest hits album during our visit
i want to fly like an eagle
to the sea
i am definitely a fan of bombay_spice
their food is delicious
healthy priced right
my boyfriend i went there the other night got an appetizer two entrees the bill was only twenty bucks
granted we did not get any drinks
but if you are going here with the intention of being healthy
you should stick with water anyway
we started with hummus
not my absolute favorite hummus but still a very yummy starter
i ordered a cauliflower curry wrap
i'm obsessed with the naan_bread
the curry made it taste like i was eating much more than just vegetables rice
getting your dish
hot
isn't really that spicy
for us anyway
we love spicy
but ask for their spiciest dipping sauce if you like more bite
i want to buy bottles of it
i saved half of the wrap for lunch_the_next_day it was still delicious
boyfriend got the chicken curry entree
basic
but he loved it
again
it was gone before i could try any of it
i worry_about places like these hidden away in strip malls
it is a really nice place
but always seems to be pretty empty when i go in
the decor is neat modern
not a kitschy indian place by_any_means
they have a pretty nice wine_list
so it would be a nice place for a quiet date
hopefully the word starts to get out that this is a delicious
healthy place that is affordable tasty enough to eat at all the time
this restaurant would be a very nice introductory experience for those who have not previously enjoyed indian food
for those who have are more experienced with indian
pakistani or afghan cuisine this restaurant will not be a par experience with your favorite family ran establishment
we used to love coming here
but last_night was the last time we will ever go
we are not a fan of the new concept noodles with indian food really
the chicken was rubbery and the naan was just slightly better than cardboard
from what i can tell
while waiting almost minutes for our food
is that they have one good waitress
but unfortunately she was not our server
we had enjoyed a meal here about a year_ago
we went here again to enjoy a vegan meal
it was a total disappointment
after ordering a meatless meal
the waitress brought us a free appetizer with bits of chicken on it
i thanked her but refused because we did not eat meat
she made big noise of disgust and returned it to the kitchen
i ordered naan and got some roti wrap
the waitress insisted it was naan it was not
the kitchen staff were cutting up and having a good time in spanish and the waitress was having a great time with them not conducive to dinner
the supposedly spicy sauce was incredibly bland and i could have had a wrap at chipotle that was better
two days after we ate there
my spouse's credit_card was used in egypt and some other country so he had to cancel his card
so if you go there use cash
mouth wateringly goooood food
nothing on the menu is over calories and the owner is a doctor nutritonist who spent a lot of effort on craft the menu
it really shows in the quality of what's to offer
everything looked good and smelled awesome
but in the end one always has to make a choice
so
my wife and i ended_up going for the chickpea_ceviche starter
then lamb kebobs and chicken curry with extra pappadoms instead of naan to keep it gluten_free
all dishes were a smash hit and washed down with a perfect mango_lassi drink
delish
wait a sec the picture that jessica f uploaded of the dishes and a drink was my lunch
i'm so looking_forward to coming_back here for another taste_buds extravaganza
the only thing i'd change is that the page menu to download from their_website is a whopping mb file it's time to fix that people
maybe it's just me
but i don't understand why this place is still in business
okay
admittedly i'm not a big_fan of indian_cuisine
but i've been here twice now
once to try it for myself and another time because a girlfriend dragged me here
i just don't get it
with so many restaurants going out of business
how is this one still making a go
i will say the servers are very friendly_and_attentive
but
for me
that doesn't make up for the lack of ambiance and the food
the place is located in a strip_mall and the inside is just okay
most of the tables are placed close together
so you could easily hear one another's conversation
however
since we were the only people in the restaurant
this turned out to not be a problem
the food is okay
i guess
i'm not a big_fan of lamb or curry
so i can't be a good judge
i ordered the vegetarian flat_bread and it was okay
i also had an ice tea
but it had a weird and slightly unpleasant flavor
if they don't start drawing in more customers
i'm thinking
they might not be around that much longer
love the food here
and so many vegetarian_options
one thing i dont like is the masala iced_tea
tastes like the spices in the tea should be on food
omg what a nice place
but the food no comment
please save your money for another authentic place
everything was made sweet to accomodate the unknown taster's palate
dosa was as soft as a crepe
korma had fruit like mango raisins and half grapes in it sweet
tandoori wings in a sweet and sower sauce
nothing was the way we expected an authentic indian pakistani restaurant to be booohooo
if you like indian_cuisine
this is the place to go
lamb_chops appetizer amazing
entree equally delish
great service too
bombay has done an absolutely fabulous job in menu revisions lately
being a vegetarian
it is a fabulous place
there is a tofu or potato option available for all entree choices
there food is also extremely low calorie and healthy
it's so darn good
though that this seems to be untrue
but it's not
i never feel overly full or stuffed
they have awesome wine specials
bucks a bottle for a large variety of
tastes some high end
and some couple's nights deals comparable to most restaurants
buckish
happy_hour specials look awesome
though end before i'm off work and head out
i minus one small star for service
seems mildly slackish at times and not customer centered
it's a small establishment
so i unfortunately cannot blame a busy server bartender
at times the service does seem aloof
however
if you love modern music
fabulous indian food
and a wide_variety of wine
come hither
it's a great place i feel is trying to improve and i applaud the option of vegetarian_dishes and all low calorie
body happy foods
kudos bombay
we used our discount coupon that we bought at homerun
com to try bombay_spice grill
it was wonderful
food was delicious
reasonably_priced and healthy
the service was great
very friendly
it was a great experience and we will_definitely_go_back there
stopped in for lunch
not fancy
if you want a great chicken curry
come here
service was great
i'd come for dinner any time
good wine selection
i went here last week and i am definitely a fan
i love indian food
so hearing this is a healthier version of indian_cuisine i had to try it
i got the lentil cakes as an appetizer which were really good
the main_course i got was veggie tikka masala
the sauce isn't what you would get at a traditional_indian restaurant
but it is flavorful and delicious
i would have to say you can't compare this restaurant to an indian restaurant
because they are very different
i would say this is modern indian food
kind of like pf changs is to chinese_food
i gave them stars
because the service is alright
they weren't attentive and we did wait awhile to put in our order and to get our food
the good news is that they have bottles of wine
so it gave_us time to finish the bottle without chugging
awesome food service reasonably_priced
while i am not a huge indian fan
i am now this place exceed all expectations
our starter was the eggplant it was perfect texture and the brown soy sweet sauce was out_of_this_world seriously i'm actually craving it right now
next up chick_pea ceavecha with crispy wavers was also dead on reminded_me_of a pumped up salsa and the chick_peas again perfectly_cooked amazing flavor
so at this point i'm sold and then bam tandoori chicken_wings holly smoke amazing sweet smoky sauce and best part no grease really quality pieces of wings and drumsticks
we also had the little rack of lamb app again cooked_perfectly
wonderful lamb flavor not too strong just perfect and presentation was beautiful green rosemary lightly sprinkled on top
flatbreads veggie and chicken again
flavors were out_of_this_world cheese was mild
veggies tasted perfect
our large group's favorite was the curry i thought my colleague was going to lick the bowl it came in it was a bit embarrassing
oh and our youngest member of the group got chicken fingers which were made in house and came with no grease and lightly breaded
it made me realize the importance this place puts on the quality of the food
shout out to a great server jewels who really is a precious jewel in his own right and as the girls at the table said with some serious good looks too
they loved his smile and his dark hair and eyes
he was very attentive
earnest and always asking if we needed anything at perfectly timed spots in the meal
he made sure we we had what we wanted and we had a good time
his recommendations were dead on too especially with the wine which they have quite a selection
the decor is really cool i loved the green wine bottle wall
seems like something i'd see in nyc or la
it's very hip love the color it really sets the mood
that's the other thing it has a bar and that definitely gives it a bit of an edge
the bar was packed and they had a henna artist who was giving katy perry like henna on hands and arms
someone in our group said this was
modern indian
everyone in our group said they'd never been to a place like this before and were really impressed
so if this place is modern indian sign me up
i am in love with the food
flavors
service
decor
best part is when our waiter told us nothing was over calories
it was like the music stopped and everyone turned to look at him how could that be
typically more flavor more calories
but i actually believe them because i'm writing this the morning after our meal and i feel terrific none of that morning hangover from eating too much
bottom_line best damn indian i've ever had and actually converted me to be able to say yeah i like indian modern indian food
lunch time and one waiter is always a gamble
lunch took over an_hour and all we had was apps
the chick_pea ceviche
lentil cakes and grilled eggplant all had the same over use of one sauce
plus lentil cakes came out look warm and the
vindaloo
sauce tasted just like
rooster
sauce
too many choices in the area
i will_not_be_returning
i'm happy to be able to update my review
i do love_this_place the flavor is unparalleled
they have changed their menu yet again
but now you can add a vegetable to your dish for only dollar
this is fantastic
i love the chicken keema
curry
rice
and potatoes combination
its a delicious explosion of flavor
the service can be spotty sometimes
but come here for he food and flavor
chicken_tikki_masala was amazing
great deal on wednesday's for date_night
entrees
app
desert
bottle_of_wine for
highly_recommend
does trendy healthy
well here it seems to
while this is one of the few trendy americanaized indian restaurant in town
the big star here for me is the menu
vegiteran dishes and vegan ones are all marked on the menu
in addition many menu_items can have the protein of choice including tofu and or veggies
and a choice of starch
rice
brown_rice or egg noodles
we had two build you own combos
curry with mixed veggies and tofu over noodles
for tofu
the curry was a bit bland and the noodles to me were not the best match
but if it were truly healthy i would be ok with the flavor
the other dish was a spinach dish
with mixed veggies and brown_rice
i really enjoyed this dis
as with thai food you get to pick you heat_level so anyone can eat here
for flavors it was stars the veggie_options made it
however i did miss the bollywood music i usually hear with my indian food
a girlfriend and i have been meaning to check bombay_spice out for a while but have never gotten around to it until last_night
i found a great deal on localdines
com use ref if you sign up
also
checking in with foursquare got a us a deal
we ended_up going a little later
ish
so there wasnt a wait or a crowd at all which was nice because the venue is a little smaller
the bartender was very friendly
our serve was a little distracted and took a little longer to respond to our needs but she was very nice
we both had wine
the
single glass
serving is actually glasses in case you are torn between splitting a bottle for or just buying a glass for
i recommend the falling star cab
it was full bodied and very yummy
the other wine we tried was the hob nob pinot noir
it was great
it had a delicious combination of earthy and sweet tones to it
i am not very good with wine lingo
but those are my unofficial terms that make sense to me
neither of us were very hungry but we wanted to sample the fare so we could at least see if we wanted to come back
we got to choose either a free humus or a dessert because of my deal for checking in on foursquare
power nerd
i know
i really wanted to try the mango sorbet but we opted for the chickpea hummus and roti bread
for those of you
like me
who aren't sure what roti bread is its much lighter than pita_bread and a little thinner than a tortilla
its very tasty
the hummus was very good
and they garnished it with diced tomatoes
onions and cilantro which i loved
we also ordered the seared eggplant
it was awesome
it was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby
thats a technical term in case you were wondering
they also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good
in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce
our waitress told me the name and i couldnt remember it for the life of me
which was spicy
i really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant
i will_be_going_back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce
there are a lot of vegetarian_vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu
their menu also boasts that everything
except for or items
is completely gluten_free
good experience
definitely looking_forward to trying it again for a full meal
ehhh it's edible
my friend tina t
invited me to join her for a wine and henna event that they host thursday nights during the summer
for you get your st glass_of_wine and a henna design
while here we also sampled from their happy_hour menu
i have to say i was absolutely impressed with the tofu app and the garlic_naan
we also tried a chickpea_ceviche
the chicken_tika and the tandoori wings
again of all those the tofu was my favorite
the lady doing the henna designs was amazingly detailed
very traditional henna designs with a paste that turned a very beautiful dark burgundy brown
while it is not your
traditional
indian_cuisine
all the wonderful flavors are present
the last thing i want to eat when it is deg out is heavy saags or cream laden indian dishes
the dishes here are light and flavorful
i look_forward to going back to another wine and henna event and would not hesitate stopping in for a bite to eat if in the area
i've been to bombay_spice before and i've always loved their food
it's delicious
tasty and the service has always been wonderful
i went their recently with friends during yelp eats and was able to have a full menu with wonderful prices
i got a groupon and was excited_to_try a new indian restaurant
we were seated_right_away and received our drinks not far behind
there was one server and one guy just walking around not too sure what his roll was
my husband and i both ordered the
naan_bread tikka masala chicken
sandwich
the
naan_bread
was a tortilla and the tikka masala was out of a can
not very flavorful
the only reason why i knew that there were veggies in the sandwich was because i saw them they also didn't have any flavor
i asked for more tikka masala sauce due to the dryness of the sandwich and it arrived just two bites before i was done
yes
i finished my sandwich but that was because i was extremely hungary
we went to try the restaurant due to the reviews but i was very disappointed
maybe the dinner menu is better
chris
the manager
is great
their
happy_hour items are unique and delicious
wednesday nights
they have a special for an appetizer
ewine bottle
entrees and dessert for
check out their off deals on www
groupon
com
www
localdines
com
etc
it's a great deal with these coupons
in short
horrible tasting food
far from authentic ofcourse
their selling spiel is all about how there is not butter or oil used
i would have been happy by that as long as they make sure the food is well cooked without too much oil
their concept is to not use butter oil as cooking medium and then serve tasteless
undone food
samosas were bland and too soft
ofcourse not fried
not even pan tossed well
bhel_puri was a sham like the worst ever
veggie main_dish was tasteless
very low on salt and spices
if that is a health diet need
one could enjoy a meal there
but for tasting good indian food this is just not the place
i did the
create your own entree
white rice
tikka masala
lamb
had papadam crisps to scoop up the lamb
it was really good
i asked for extra spice
otherwise they serve it not so spicy
it was a bit spicy
but still could of had a bit more heat
on a scale of to
i would say the spice was a
it was still delicious
i ordered a ginger green tea and it had no flavor
it was mostly water
rave alert
this place has an awesome happy_hour
i mean super awesome
the line on their menu describing the food as
authentic flavors refined
is too accurate to improve upon
all the things that usually make me want to sprint in the opposite direction of an indian restaurant
buffet style setup
clashing colors
poor presentation
poor service and funky smells were not present at bombay_spice
in other words
the experience was much less of a culture shock for me
elegant and modern style decor
dine ware and silverware did the trick
the staff was very friendly_and_helpful
i can't_wait_to_go_back
i had the indian chai latte
chicken_tikka
samosa and carrot_halwa
total bill before tip
how can i not give this place stars
i mean
seriously
what i'd recommend
going for their amazing happy_hour
as well as their indian chai latte
chicken_tikka
samosa and carrot_halwa
i like this place
its not my favorite
but i will happily go there
cons
you really need to ask questions about the menu_items
otherwise you will literally have a thin layer of peas and potatoes between a tortilla
pros
the food is pretty good
and its easy for a vegan to find something they will enjoy
they have relatively decent wines by the bottle at low prices and the wait_staff is friendly
bombay also has special events certain days of the week
which is fun
date_night i believe is on wednesdays
with good specials for couples
and they also have henna tattooing on another night
clean
good food
reasonable_prices
very good service and tasty food
the only reason i didn't give it a five is because of consistency
there does not seem to be consistency in level of spice
we go there often and sometimes spicy means mild to the cook and sometimes it actually comes out nice and spicy
at our table we had the chickpea_ceviche which was fantastic
the korma
tikka masala and curry
all were very good
first time having indian food ever
if it's all like this and better
i'm on board with indian food for life
almost everything on the menu has calories or less
there's a vegetarian option to everything on the menu
the food has no added fats or oil
which is a new concept for me because i love oils and butter
the flavors come from cardamom
cumin
turmeric
tamarind
and etc
constructed in a way to bring out or enhance the lamb
chicken
lentil
etc
i enjoyed in the food even more in the nice modern decor
they have all the alcoholic selection display in a grid like cubical on the wall with a green back light
highly_recommend bombay_spice as you intro to indian food
i'm sure it only gets crazier
first off
i should have listened to the reviews
this is definitely an indian restaurant that is catered to first time indian food triers
of course the flavor will be bland when using no butter cream in indian food
but it still tasted good
very light
if i lived closed i would_definitely_come_back for the happy_hour
which is really good
a few bucks for small portions of different indian_cuisine a
we ordered from the happy_hour to start tofu really good but only pieces
samosas yummy for not being fried and my bf got the chicken_wings
he said they were spicy
we both ordered from the create your entree section for our meal
i was wondering about the noodles which is really odd to see on an indian menu
luckily the waitress said under her breath that they are not good and then said after
wow i should really not have said that
i appreciaited it though
i got the brown_rice
mixed_vegetables and tikka masala
my bf got brown_rice
lamb and tikka masala
the good thing is that you can eat the whole dish and not feel really bloated and full like regular indian food
but it was a little bland and did not taste like authentic_indian_food
it almost reminded_me_of the trader joe's indian food packs you can buy there
overall i would visit this restaurant if you live close by and order from the happy_hour menu
i've gone to bombay_spice or times
i keep trying it because the first couple times were awesome
but the service absolutely sucks
their new manager is awful
last time we were there our server put only our appetizer order in and not the rest
our appetizers went accidentally to a table next to us who came minutes after us and ordered the same thing
we then had to tell them we did not get our apps
after waiting another and getting our apps
we sat there waiting for our dinner only to find out they forgot to put it in
their suave manager
who thinks he's the hottest thing around
was not nice about it or apologetic
a couple nights ago we tried again
i really do like the food and we wanted to give it another go
we brought our week old who is super well behaved and were excited for a bottle_of_wine and dinner
it took minutes for someone to come take our drink order
we then waited over minutes for our entrees and there was nobody in the restaurant except for a large_party on the patio of women
who the manager was super attentive to because he obviously likes a table of good looking ladies since he spent the whole night checking on them and never said a word to us
i approached our waitress to see when our dinner may be coming and let her know my quiet baby wouldn't be quiet for much longer
minutes_later the food came and i asked if she could bring our check so that we could get that taken_care_of
she disappeared
couldn't find her after we finished our meal
so again
we waited
unreal
i will_never_go_back to this place
giving it stars because i've always really enjoyed the food
this was definitely a hidden jewel
i am so glad that i found it on yelp
the food was great
the service was great and the atmosphere was fun and inviting
they seem to have some great prices for happy_hour also
i will_definitely_be_back here
its worth_the_drive
i love indian food
i'll admit that it's the hardest to judge
in my opinion
due to the lack of what i know about it the complexity of all the spices
i also feel i've been slightly ruined after eating at some incredible restaurants in london
all that said
i love_this_place
i've never had a bad meal here
and i was actually motivated to write a review because of the service we had this weekend
let's start with the food
i imagine that some hardcore foodies probably think their food is not
totally authentic
and they might be right
however
the food is as good as i have had in other places
i find their use of spices fresh_ingredients are well balanced
they have a lot of great vegetarian_options as well
the service there is always top_notch
as mentioned earlier
our server this weekend really knocked the experience out of the park
i asked her about this hot spice sauce that is served
and she could see i was disappointed to find out they make it in house
so
not available by some generic name i could get at a specialty shop
she didn't hesitate to go to the back
and brought be a small bottle of it as a gift
i was blown_away
finally
i'll say that their bottomless lunch on the weekends is a steal
and a great way to try a little bit of everything
they also have an insanely killer food selection for happy_hour
i miss living over by pv mall
because i could eat here everyday
been here many times for lunch and dinner
always tasty
nice selection
like the naan
esp
like the lamb chop appetizer
like the naanwich
miss the th and glendale location i used to frequent
after seeing some bad reviews i was reluctant to try bombay_spice
but i am so glad i did
the food is not authentic_indian_food
the server even told us when we were sat that it is americanized indian food
it is definitely an interpretation
there was cilantro in my dish
but as long as you have that understanding before you go
you should be fine
they had an interesting selection of beer_and_wine
unfortunately my husband did not care for his ipa and i didn't love my glass of pinot grigio
luckily
the drinks were the only thing we disliked
i ordered the mixed veggies entree with spinach sauce
since the server told me it was americanized indian food
i was worried it wouldn't be spicy and i love a little heat
you are able to customize the spice_level
thank god
so i ordered it medium
i thought the plating was attractive and enticing
and the food was yummy
not swimming in ghee so it goes down smoothly
there was a delicious smoky grilled taste to the food that i loved
i wish it came with more naan
the naan was delicious too
nice and crispy and garlicky
you can definitely taste the olive oil in the food which i wasn't expected to like
my husband had the chicken_biryani
he loved it
the portions are enormous
so i had plenty of food leftover for a yummy lunch_the_next_day
the service was great
our server was eager
informative
and just a sweetheart
their brunch and happy_hour sound amazing
unfortunately their happy_hour ends at
so i wouldn't be able to make after work
i might just have to sneak out early
i already want to go back
the menu had so many tasty options
i love indian food
and i realize this is americanized indian food
but it was rather delicious
the menu offers gluten_free
vegetarian
and vegan_options
i ordered the chef's special to try the four sauces with rice
naan
and the two ingredients in which one can choose
the tikka masala sauce was definitely the best
but the others had great flavors too
i got the vegan chicken and mixed_vegetables
it was so delicious
and i am already trying to think of when i can return
the service was ok
it took a while when we were done
and they weren't that busy
however
it's not a big_deal
very americanized indian food with bad bad service
nice vegan and vegetarian_options though
i tried the chef's special and the four sauces seem to be all a bit off
only the spinach curry was any good
any don't go for the noodles
i know
its a weird option and as you know it
weird combo
went out of my way driving but a huge disappointment
i was told it was the best indian restaurant ever by a woman who has spent much time in that country
not sure what she must have had
liked what i had
chicken_biryani i have had better
but the presentation was a bit off
sticking papadoms in the biryani rice made them soggy
why do that
i prefer a less trendy place
went to bombay_spice for lunch
quick
attentive service
ordered the chicken curry with potatoes and rice
it comes with naan
food was good
not exceptional
not bad
spice wise
it falls short of the explosion of flavors indian_cuisine is known for
i would described it as watered_down indian food
still may do in a pinch if i'm craving indian
i finally got to try bombay_spice grill last_night and i loved it
wonderful service
great unique and flavorful food and a really nice mellow atmosphere
we had my book club there and the waitress was fabulous providing us with wonderful service and gave all of us separate checks
the happy_hour prices are fabulous
i would definitely have the chick_pea ceviche again mmmmm
i can't_wait_to_go_back and try more things on their creative menu
lunched ther today and asked for iced_tea
got a glass of dark tea
barely spiced
period
ordered chicken_biryani and the dish included four raisins
three slivered almonds
two small fresh spinach leaves and loads of chicken neatly cubed and somewhat dry
my partner's eggplant sat in a sweet sauce
perhaps the same as the one offered with the samosas
i like healthy food
but i also like tasty food and i expect vegetables to dominate the meat
i will not return to this restaurant
i appreciate the effort to cut down on fats
but the scarcity of spinach and condiments in the biryani is unforgivable
strikes me that it came out of a large precooked pot in which the ingredients had not been thoroughly mixed
lovely presentation if that is your number one priority
i'll take the tandoori_times any day over this
i don't know what you'd call this place fusion indian food
definitely a westernized take on indian food
the only upside being that they really seem to cater to vegans
vegetarians and gluten_free diners
but the food was just not a good representation of what vegans
vegetarians or even indians
eat
terribly bland
i had the mango salad which had no mangoes in it
i am pretty sure it should have been called pseudo mango salad
if i order something called mango salad
i fully expect some nice juicy chunks of the fruit
the boyfriend ordered a chicken_tikka wrap supposedly wrapped in naan
seemed more like a regular tortilla
i had a bite
the flavor was okay
i much prefer the nann wraps at tandoori_times they are
for one
definitely wrapped in naan
and two
exploding with flavor and at the same price
the ambiance was okay
a modern sort of cafe
the service was no good
really slow
and i wouldn't say particularly friendly
this was the first and last time we'll ever go
very mediocre food
i get it's trying to cater to the indian food novice
but really
what's the point
authentic flavors refined
c'mon
you don't need to go overboard on the garam masala and ghee but the lack of
bombay_spice
was very evident
there are far better indian places that offer quality food for the same price or less
one word
bland
we have kids with very severe food allergies
dairy milk
peanut
tree nuts
egg
sesame
flax
etc
the manager patiently worked with me and made sure the items we ordered would be safe and free from cross contamination
food was great
and
worked just fine for our allergies
tons of vegan_options as well as chicken
beef
lamb
etc
thanks keith and the staff at bombay_spice
i frequent bombay_spice for a few reasons
i like familiarity and they have a really good regular staff
the food is healthy
they post ww points
which is good for me
and the food is very good
i have never had a bad meal at this place
everything is just really good
we have gone to their sunday brunch a few times to try even more
which with the more modest servings allows you to taste a variety and really hone in on what you might have for dinner or a lunch sometime
having frequented more traditional indian_restaurants i don't want people to think that i endorse bombay_spice as the most authentic indian_cuisine
i do know that it is not
but it has the preparation and flavor that i often find myself craving
so i am definitely a fan
now for some of the stereotypical impatient pre madonna pv scottsdale types
you know who you are
own up to it
it is ok
i am from scottsdale too
this is not a speed eating restaurant
bombay by how they serve food and interact with the customers are creating a laid back
enjoyable
social dining_experience
so that means that it has a pace that often americans are not accustomed to
bombay fosters an atmosphere where the customer actually likes who they are dining with and wants to talk to that person
so when you sit there acting all annoyed because it is the end of the meal and you are waiting for your check and you are getting all agitated
maybe premptively letting the server know you need the check when they take your food away etc is the better approach than getting all huffy
they are tring not to rush you
eat at this place
it is healthy
tasty and relaxing
a few months_ago i gave bombay_spice a bad review and the manager reached out to me and gave me a gift_certificate to try it again
my husband was reluctant after a really bad experience but we went back again a_few_weeks_ago
i've never had any issues with the food its fantastic
but the service was never good
i think the manager has hired some really great new servers
our waitress was so on top of it and we had a wonderful dinner
we went back again tonight with a big group
and a baby
and again
super service
feeling optimistic bombay_spice has turned it around and very excited that they have
henna happy_hour
never heard of it
well i'm a fan because it's different
glass_of_wine and a henna tattoo for starting at pm on thursdays
we got there early to enjoy happy_hour first which is pm
glasses of wine
the food was flavorful but what really made the experience is the staff
everyone was so friendly and easy to talk to
suggested things on the menu that they really enjoyed and helped me make my decision on dinner which i had the salmon and loved
the weekend lunch_special
is great
it's like a buffet but better because they cook up your food fresh as you want it
you pick from about five appetizers and five entrees and two desserts all you want
we tried chick_pea ceviche
lentil towers
and paratha
i liked the chick_pea ceviche and the lentil tower best
the paratha is basically bread
we picked tikka masala with chicken and quinoa and chicken_vindaloo with brown_rice
both were good with the chicken being fresh and moist
the tikka masala had a little heat to it and a slight sweetness to it
the vindaloo was much more savory with much more heat that did build up
when we finished our server asked us what entree we'd like to try next but we declined another entree but decided to try the carrot_halwa
the carrot_halwa is almost like a pudding but without starch and it seemed healthy
i was told by the server that this is americanized indian food made heathy style without butter or cream and nothing is fried here almost everything is calories or less
the new times awarded them
best use of a chickpea
for the chickpea_ceviche
chef sunil kumar's recipe is posted on examiner
com jon kapoor's
executive chef at bombay_spice
has his recipe for tikka_marsala sauce posted on abc
com sonoran living
the weekend lunch_special is a great introduction to try indian style cuisine
this is one of our favorite places for healthy
flavorful food
we love spicy food and the vindaloo dipping sauce is a staple for us here as we add it to just about everything we order
for appetizers
the lentil cake towers
seared tofu
and baked samosas are some of our favorites
although we've honestly never had anything here that we haven't liked
the vegetable naan wrap and veggie flatbread both have great flavor and as far as the entrees go
we've had numerous combinations of veggies
tofu
chickpeas
lentils
etc
with both the vindaloo and hot curry sauces and all have been delicious
bombay_spice also has a good selection of inexpensive wines available for per bottle that complement the food well
if this place was located a bit closer to our house
we'd be there even more often given how many vegetarian_options they have to offer
i am newly gluten_free and dairy free
although not a vegan
i'd been dying to try a tikka masala but had never been able to due to the common use of cream in the dish
i was amazed to find this restaurant had extensive gf and vegan menu options
our server
also possibly the owner or manager
was patient and knowledgeable about my requests
the lentil towers were delicious
the chicken_tikka_masala was rich and savory and delicious and even came with some gf bread for dipping
i also loved the iced_tea
i look_forward to returning to this place
not even waiting to leave the restaurant before drafting this review
this food is like a flavor explosion of spices your tongue has never met
i don't like weird food or new food
but after finding out about this gem at the scottsdale food festival over a year_ago
we knew we had to try it out
after loving it twice
and now having seen their amazing staff in action i'm a believer
ordered
chickpea hummus a
samosa a
eggplant a
behl puri a
chickpea_ceviche b
had to give something less than an a
only did apps because we have plans for dinner
will re do when we come back for date_night
btw
the iced_tea is to die for
full of spices and
yeah
i'll shut up now
omg this is my favorite place
great food
great atmosphere wonderful
if_you're_looking for
really
good
not greasy indian food
this is the place for you
i highly_recommend bombay for people who haven't had indian food and want to give it a try
the food is well priced and as fresh and flavorful as you can get
if they had a bombay_spice in old town
i would eat here every day for lunch
went to this location because it is gluten_free
have a daughter that is gluten soy dairy allergic
a vegetarian and a vegan in the family
oh_yeah
one meat_eater as well
what a wonderful surprise
the food was delicious
lots of choices for all and the portions were a very nice size
we all walked away very satisfied and looking_forward to more visits
you_will_not_be_disappointed
i tried this place out with a friend recently
and was pleasantly_surprised
the vibe of the place was a bit americanized
but beyond that
the food was delicious
catching the tail end of their pm happy_hour
we ordered a half dozen mild tandoori wings for only
and they were amazing
we also tried the lamb_vindaloo and the chicken_tikka_masala
and both were also delicious
the vindaloo
though
is definitely for the more adventurous
it's insanely spicy
in total
with tax and tip
we spent around per_person for a nice dinner in a comfortable atmosphere
and our waitress was lovely
definitely worth a try
and i'll be sure to go back
i've been three times now
the first time with a big group private party where i was dazzled
the second time with a girlfriend where it was ho hum
and the third time just last week with the boyfriend where i was pretty disappointed
for the large event
the quality of food was outstanding
i was so excited_to_try these dishes i'd never had before
at the time
i was newly vegetarian
and my taste_buds were exploding with every bite
the lentil cake towers blew my mind
and i couldn't get enough of the little bites of heaven
the second time
i expected the same
outstanding flavors
great service
and an overall terrific experience
the only thing terrific was the mango martini
wowie
it's delicious
trying to maneuver the menu options for vegan gluten_free was far too complicated and confusing
i ordered the lentil cake towers again
and they were delicious
we also ordered the seared tofu as another app
and they were so so
i love tofu
but knew i wouldn't be ordering them again
i ordered the vegetable naan wrap
good but missing
something
the third time
i insisted we have the mango martini
they were out of a couple ingredients
but the bartender did what he could with what he had his improvisational attempt was still delicious
this time
we ordered the seared eggplant which had great flavor but was overcooked and soggy
the lentil cake towers
which were good but nowhere near the explosion of flavor the previous two times
and the vegetable_samosa
which was a disappointment
the saving grace of the third trip was gabriel
i'm really hoping that's his name
the bartender and our server
he was attentive and on his game
so much so that my boyfriend commented if he were opening his restaurant here instead of san diego
he'd snatch gabriel up in a heartbeat
i was really pleased with bombay_spice
it's definitely not your typical indian restaurant setting
think more contemporary american decor
i mean the smiths were playing on the stereo which gave it a nice relaxing casual vibe
we were served by a great friendly waitress who really knew the food and explained everything real well
you can tell she was very excited about it
we started with the appetizer sampler which had four selections of appetizers of your choosing
all were outstanding especially the wings and the chickpea_ceviche
i then tried the chicken_tikka_masala which had lots of great flavor and a nice kick then we checked in on yelp and got a free dessert
great prices and the way you order the food makes it really simple
great little casual place tucked_away in the corner of a strip_mall near pv mall
there are some
non traditional
or
americanized
ethnic places that
while not true to the country's original dishes
still pull off a delicious meal
bombay_spice is not one of them
not only was the food unrecognizable as indian
but it legitimately tasted awful
we had the
chef sampler
which allowed us to try out of of the different sauce bases that the facility provides
we had the curry
the spinach
the tikka masala
and the korma with broccoli and vegan chicken
pros
the appetizer
though it didn't taste similar to typical indian food
was not bad
we had the lentil towers
the wine selection was fairly sizeable
the service was wonderful
the curry
though it didn't taste like traditional curry
was relatively palatable in comparison with the other dishes
cons
the naan is actually toasted pita_bread
the tikka masala was not well spiced and was very sweet
it almost tasted like over sweetened yams pureed
it wasn't just disappointing as tikka masala sauce
it was also legitimately disgusting
the spinach may have just been salted
cooked down spinach and water
it lacked any spice at all
save salt
it had a lot of salt
the korma was incredibly sweet
it tasted predominantly like sugar water and truly nothing else
the chunks of mango that were included in the sauce were practically savory in comparison
needless_to_say
this restaurant is not one i would recommend
i just tried bombay_spice for the first time and was pleasantly_surprised
i've eaten alot of indian food
and while some of the items may not be authentic
i still thought the flavors and quality were great
i don't eat meat and there are plenty of veggie_options
i'm really surprised people complained about the service we had fantastic service
i went with a group of and we all ordered the lunch buffet
amazing value
it's different than other indian_buffets in that you order as much as you want from a list of appetizers
then put together your entree of choice
all the appetizers were tasty
good portion_sizes
for my entree i had eggplant and cauliflower curry
which really was amazing
i can't wait to return
i went to bombay_spice not long after moving to paradise valley from scottsdale
i knew that it was a 'healthier' indian food
but i didn't know that meant they didn't use salt
at all
got a cup of lentil soup
and while i could taste the spices in it
it was watery and bland
the texture was really off putting
the chicken_tikka_masala with cauliflower was no better
it was a huge portion
but bland bland bland
the 'naan' i liked
even though it is clearly non traditional and clearly not homemade
i will never ever come back here and waste my money on bland food again
yes
not your traditional_indian food because they don't use butter
fry things
etc
for some things that makes a big difference
the samosas for instance aren't nearly as good as real fried samosas
frying makes everything better
and less healthy obviously
but other dishes were very close approximations and much healthier
was the tikka masala as good as if it was loaded with butter
no
of course not
but i thought it was still quite tasty and was happy knowing that i could enjoy a healthy version of one of my favorite indian dishes
the service was pretty good
no complaints there
looked like they had a huge wine selection for such a small restaurant
if you want traditional_indian that's fine
just go to a traditional_indian restaurant
so come to bombay_spice knowing what you're in for and you'll be satisfied
went to bsg for the second time friday_night
i thought the service was real good
the food is different but good
reasonable_price
also good to see a manager interacting with customers
i will be back
eh mix and match entree is not my bag
but try the vegan lamb
yessssss
and both the vegan chicken and the seared tofu were wonderful
read the descriptions of each sauce before you order even if you know what they taste like traditionally
my first visit here was amazing
the place is very cute
i always pass by this place thinking i wouldn't like anything on the menu
so i decided_to_give it a chance when a friend recommended this place for a healthy lunch or dinner
i got the chicken biryane with quinoa
it was delicious
chris was a awesome server and super friendly
it you are a local you get off every time you come in
i will_definitely_be_back
this place is in our neighborhood but i don't know why we don't go here more often it is really very good
don't profess to be an expert in indian_cuisine
but do enjoy it a lot and this place
although not totally authentic
and that's not always a bad thing
has great food
the place is small compact
clean
with a modern contemporary d_cor
the
create your entr_e
menu is a great idea and a nice option
especially to those unfamiliar with indian_cuisine
the chicken curry was very good
the chicken_biryani was beautifully present ed and absolutely_delicious
the menu is explanatory
and the servers very knowledgeable about all of the dishes
although no one in our party is vegan or requires gluten_free foods
having the option is a smart thing to do for restaurateurs to expand their clientele
if you are new to indian food
this is a good first step
go ahead
don't be afraid
you will be pleasantly_surprised how good it is
and the fact that bombay_spice offers healthy alternatives is icing on the cake
we had a lovely dinner here last_night and we have never been anything but happy with the food and service here
they spice these exactly as you ask them and the food is so delicious and plentiful that we have always found this a great place to dine
we especially like the ceviche starter which is always very tasty and filling
great place
i was a little disappointed that my server didn't offer me the bottomless weekend lunch_special
the weekend lunch_special is something like
and all_you_can_eat appetizers lunch plates and dessert
i had it last time and it was very good
at the time i thought they discontinued it but the table next to me got the menu for it but i still had an enjoyable lunch here anyway
they offer an appetizer sampler plate where you pick four appetizers for
i picked chickpea_ceviche
lentil cake towers
chicken_tikka kebab
and chicken seekh kabab
my husband liked the seekh kabab best and said to him it tasted like sausage and peppers
i thought everything was tasty and flavorful and the chicken was prepared very well being moist tender and flavorful
it was a good amount of food but not quite enough for two people so we shared a hot chicken_vindaloo
the vindaloo was very spicy and chicken was very moist tender and flavorful
i thought this dish was presented very nicely with the indian style bread
naan
and cracker
papadum
this dish cost
and i added mixed_vegetables to the dish for a
more
i don't mean to knit pick but if i'm being totally honest i need to mention my server told me the mixed_vegetables were a mix of the vegetable choices like cauliflower eggplant and other stuff but what i recieved were similar to frozen mix you buy at the store
carrots peas corn but i won't dwell on that and let it slide
i'd make a different vegetable selection next time
the food here is americanized indian style food that is mostly low fat and healthy
they offer healthy side dishes like quinoa and brown_rice
no butter or ghee is in the house
they use olive oil instead
the restaurant is casual but stylish
they also are accommodating to vegans and vegetarians
drive by here all the time and have never stopped
seen it in several magazines
great atmosphere inside
service is nice and friendly
had the weekend bottomless brunch special for
it is like a buffet but you tell them what you want off a special menu and they cook smaller portions of it fresh on the spot in the open kitchen that you can see while being seated
you can basically eat as much as you want
i was not sure what to try but my server nessa was a sweetheart and ask me a few questions about flavors and meats and i let her decide for me
i just said hook me up
had the lental cake tower
naan_bread stuffed with potatoes and peas
shrimp_curry
chicken_tikka_masala and some type of carrot desert
i could of eaten more but i was feeling pretty full
great flavors and aromas
you can get mild or as spicy as you want
food was fresh
healthy and presentation was great
i can't_wait_to_try more of the dishes
i'm not one to hand out stars
but this place deserves it for what they offer
it's pretty casual
and there is nothing jaw dropping about the atmosphere
but it's cool and kind of funky
they have a variety of vegan
gluten_free
and generally healthy options
and the prices are so cheap
the veggie nan wrap is like
and the
entrees
more like a rice or quinoa bowl
is around
the vindaloo is perfect and the curry is spicy
i love their lentil tower and the yogurt_sauce that accompanies it they even have a similar vegan style sauce if that's your preference
wine is glass
which i think it pretty pricey for this place
so we usually stick with water or tea
overall
i love going here for a healthy and flavorful meal
i have to say
this is really amazing indian food
i went on a weekend for
bottomless brunch
which includes as many appetizers as you want
an entree and dessert for
i went in with a friend on saturday around
the place was pretty empty and relaxing for a saturday afternoon
the server was incredibly friendly and made some great suggestions
here is what we got
chickpea_ceviche
a must
delicious
refreshing
and much needed in between spicy bites
seared tofu
also really good
though maybe not tricky enough to pass the carnivore's test
vegetable_samosas
lentil cake towers
definitely my favorite thing that we got
they were served warm and had delicious yogurt_sauce on them
and those were just the appetizers
basically i was blown_away by everything that was put in front of us
couldn't recommend_this_place highly enough
what a great neighborhood spot
recently went vegan and i was dog sitting for someone nearby
i stopped by here since it was close and they offered vegan_options
i was craving anything curry and spicy for weeks after i went here
i ordered the brown curry with tofu
it had huge flavor
very spicy and just a well rounded fresh meal
i am dog sitting for the same people very soon and i'll definitely have to stop by and get lunch again since it was so delicious last time
i also checked in on yelp and didn't even realize i got an offer for free dessert for checking in
that was definitely a plus
server manager was very nice and talkative
i will say though
no one noticed me standing in the doorway when i walked in for easily minutes
all the other guests kept looking at me with these pity eyes while they scarfed down their food
lol
not impressed
better indian to be had
but probably not on this side of town
i tried their tika_masala
bland
so i added some of the hot_sauce to make it more edible
i don't think i'll go back
this is fresh
very healthy
delicious indian food that's very reasonably_priced
the flavors are wonderful
despite the fact that they do not use butter
cream or ghee
and they don't fry anything
of the menu is under calories
my husband and i are suckers for their rice bowl type system
where you can choose a sauce
korma
tikka
etc
a base
rice
quinoa
etc
vegetables and protein
we've never encountered a bad combination
so let your imagination run wild
however
if you want a sure thing
get the korma with quinoa
shrimp and broccoli
the portions are large and taste amazing the next day
too
we've tried a lot of the appetizers and even a few desserts everything was delicious
we eat here at least a few times a month
now
just be careful when you go in to the tatum restaurant on a busy day
you will get the worst service ever
there are usually younger waiters and waitresses that are very nice
but on this particular sunday
there was only one waiter
mid 's dark hair
incredibly rude
i have been a customer of this restaurant since it opened
and have always enjoyed the food
but if this waiter or manager
continues to work at this restaurant
they will definitely loose a lot of their business
it's too bad a rude waiter can ruin a great restaurant
better to go during happy hours only as food is not that much great
expect chicken tandoori wings
go for brunch
it's like a buffet
but everything is cooked fresh to order
i loved the idea of choosing from a variety of indian sauces to create your own dish with meat and veggies of your choice
we had lamb
chick_peas
and broccoli in the korma sauce on top of basmati_rice and washed it down with iced indian tea
yum
the only disappointment was the gajar ka halwa
which isn't the same without ghee
simple menu that you basically build a dish from but it is very good
i only wish they had more menu_items
their iced_tea is very good
you can taste the spices they add to it
i am an indian and i have eaten at this place couple_of_times and the food here is not indian food but a modernistic type of dishes which uses some indian spices to give it a very very mild indian food taste
dont go there expecting to get your chicken tandoori or spicy chicken_tikka fix as it ain't gonna do it for you
its funny when some of the reviewers are referring it as indian food
its like comparing taco bell food with mexican food
one of our visits couple of years_ago was during their happy_hour which i thought was a good concept
if you want real north or south_indian food
there are plenty of good places in the valley
very
very disappointing
i liked their previous location and the menu
it's sad that they kept the same name after they moved
because the food and the menu choices are very poor
it has as much relevance to any indian restaurant
as a taco bell to a mexican place
will_never_go_back
chipotle meets indian food
this was great
went here for a quick lunch and it was that
great portion_size and love the choose your bowl
wrap or salad options
the flavor was amazing
the vindaloo sauce did_not_disappoint with great spice and just enough heat for my taste
this is a great option for a quick health lunch that is not a sandwich
excited_to_try more combinations soon
are you kidding me
i went to this place for lunch last week as i was waiting for my appointment with the no so genius staff at the genius bar at the apple store down the road
thats another story
but i digress
anywho
this place absolutely sucks
indian buffet scares me anyway
but this place takes it to a whole new level
the naan was dry
the was a choice of almost nothing in the buffet
i almost walked out
but since i was there and wanted to review
i couldn't accomplish my mission without taking my life in my hands and trying it
good news
i'm still alive
bad news is
i am losing faith that good indian food exists in the valley
i had a very different experience here
but i did not order from the buffet i ordered to go i had takiki marsala
channa marsala and some lovely veg samosas
this was the first time i went to this place the food was good
some of the best that i have tasted
i will definitely go to this place again the staff was friendly and i guess i am going to have to try the buffet
i have been to this place times
all for the buffet and all were good
their tandoori is decent
they always have some varied vegetable selections and the tikka is pretty good for a buffet
they have a varied selection and the staff are always friendly_and_helpful
i like that you can get garlic_naan with the buffet
i have nto yet ordered off the menu there
i had been waiting for this place to open up for months
its right by my gym and i was stocked to see this new somewhat unusual place is getting ready to get open
indian food
yummm
south_indian
hummm
cool
vegetarian
i am game
so
they finally opened up last week and we went there friday for a dinner
its not fancy and all just a few sitting stations on the big white room with a few tvs showing some indian news
you order your food at the counter
take out style
nothing interesting there
but fun starts when you get it
sizes are large
many different things to choose from
there is a condiments bar
and
most_importantly
it tastes really good
i mean fingerlickinggood
why stars
service
it was real good
owner there really friendly
very helpful and even hooked me up with a free_mango_lassi
pay next tine
maybe
he said
wow
i can not wait_to_go_back and try some other dish
i hope they stay in business and i will be able to go there time after time
you should check it out too
i like
very nice
went again for lunch
yuuummmm yummmmm polished off a huge bowl of curry eggplant
its so fucking delicious
hawaiian guy and indian girl i went with loved it as well
it is a bit more spicy then your run of the mill average indian_joint
so be aware of that
i am sure they will be happy to tone it down for you
but then
of course
you toning down your experience
i loved it as is
its awesome and i am sure as hell coming_back
please
p l e a s e do not listen to retards who bash this place for various stupid non related shit
stop by and try it
i brought half a dozen people there at various times and not one walked away disappointed from actual indian people to alabama hick
to scottsdale snob to average joe
features a very large menu with lots of choices almost all between
we each had a dosai and a samosa
everything was very good
the dosais were large and filling
all the chutneys are free with the food
the mango_lassi was delicious as well
we'll definitely_be_going_back to try more
great for lunch or dinner
at some point i'll try one of the lunch combos which sound like a great deal
as far as south_indian restaurants go this is ok
the people are the same from the udupi restaurant which btw had several health code violations
however if you are into indian food this
uncleanliness
comes part and parcel of the
indian
experience
so if you disregard the general ambiance
its quite ok in terms of its food offering
leaning strongly towards south_indian_cuisine
the quality of the food varies due to non standardization of the recipe
methinks
have tried the thali which unfortunately was cold
cold south_indian food is always yucky
i was somewhat placated with the various chutney's they have as an accompaniment
i give this place year tops before it becomes a hovel
clean
bright and quick
i came here with my husband
and we both had a combo platter that included one masala dhosa
an idli
and some sambar
it was all tasty and waaayyy too much food
i guess it's a mixed bag because some of his friends
they all work nearby
come here multiple_times a week for lunch
and others swear its awful
as for me
i like the chutney_bar it's nice to be able to get as much as you want
and i recommend both the coconut_chutney and the mint_chutney or
blend them together
like my mother in law does with her homemade kind
yummy
i think this place is quite tasty
but i won't come here often
just due to the fact that it's a major carb overload
and i wish the dhosas weren't quite so expensive
i think they're about
for one
but
that being said
it's great for a once in awhile treat
idlis
rice cakes
can be used as a good weapon substitute
hard and reliable
note
ignore the reviews above
it looks as if there is some deliberate attempt by the udupai owners to pose as members and bash this place
yes
this owner used to own udupai cafe and udupai cafe is another dosa house that competes with this eatery
if you read my other reviews
you know that i'm critical and my attention to detail is there so i'm not one of these people who likes every place he eats at
positives
i'm indian and i can assure you this place is good
i have never been to udupai cafe but based_on its failing health inspections
i would be scared to eat there
woodlands is a nice clean eatery in a nice part of chandler
it's not a restaurant
it's basically a dosa shop
they specialize in dosa and offer several types
they also have excellent indian chinese dishes
the food is consistently good and i have eaten there on several occassions
this is a lunch light dinner place
don't think of this place like a restaurant
there are several types of dosa and that's what this place specializes in
the restaurant is also modern and not is some ghetto strip_mall so don't worry_about failing health codes here
at least not for a while
negatives
their non south_indian dishes are not so good
for non indians
they should be informed that this is a dosa house so order dosa and other south_indian dishes
don't order your typical indian restaurant favorites like palak_paneer
it wasn't good here
the owner also says every dish is excellent which isn't true
he is kind of a businessman so he doesn't really care about telling you which dishes stand out
stick to the dosa and the vegetable manchurian
their mango shake wasn't very good
their chiku shake is great
very good food
i'm not indian and i don't eat indian food often
but i like it
so when the guys at work mentioned woodlands
i was excited_to_try it out
i ordered the vegetable_curry dish
you get a lot of curry and a small side of rice
it was very tasty but could use more rice
the owner
was very nice and gave our table a few sample dishes to try for free
i'm glad he did because i enjoyed them both
i am vegetarian so this will be on my 'yes' list of places to go back to
as for the atmosphere
there really isn't any
that's fine
in fact it's a refreshing change for the generic dark indian_restaurants you have all been too
woodlands reminds me of the mysore woodlands in chicago up on devon street
casual atmosphere of ordering upon entering
disposable plates containers
and no traditional server waitress to deal with
food is among the best in phoenix for south_indian fare and prices are within reasonable ranges as well
staff_was_very_friendly
location is on the ne corner of ray rural
facing the west
i love_this_place
i'd love it more if it was a few miles east
that is closer to my house
the dosa was wonderful
the puri with chick_peas was divine
the thali was good although the okra was tough
i liked my uttapam but it isn't the best i've had
i would prefer silverware over plastic and plates over paper
oh well
woodlands is my new favorite stop for indian food in the valley
what a treasure
i was very impressed with everything
they do use styrofome dishware but it makes for easy cleanup
the atmosphere was really fun
an indian movie was playing as we ate which added to the atmosphere as well
everything was very clean and picked_up
the staff were very friendly_and_helpful as well
the women that helped us explained what all the dishes were and even gave_us seconds of our favorite without any extra charge
i will be a regular here without a doubt
the prices are great too
highly_recommended
very excited_to_see this in my 'hood as i used to drive to south scottsdale to udupi for the gobi
cauliflower
manchurian and the decadent puffy bread
who would have thought you'd crave a cauiflower dish
but you will after you try it
there also is an eggplant_dish that is divine
this casual place is the best for vegetarian south_indian food
can't understand any negative reviews
friendly_staff
condiment bar
and delicious
food
don't forget to try a dosa
many to choose from and the speciality of the house
i agree with pretty much all the positive_reviews of this place
thumbs_up for the dosai
for the lassi
and for the manchurian vegetables
so i'll just chime in to say try the lemon_rice
holy wow it's good
the portions are generous
and the prices_are_pretty typical for food in the 'burbs
i also agree that you shouldn't go in expecting a
dinner out on the town
experience
i'm intolerably picky about lighting
so we took ours home
and we just kept pulling containers out of the takeout bag with incredulous expressions
in addition to the entrees we expected
there was soup
three kinds of chutney
an unexpected side of plain rice
like i said
they aren't stingy
and in case you missed it
lemon_rice
it's my new constant craving
very disappointed
the dosas were greasy
sambar too salty
idlis dense
on top of all this
they are expensive and in no way eco friendly
all items were served on styrofoam
since when can restaurants not wash a few dishes
never returning
after reading reviews
i had trouble deciding what to order
as a recently converted vegan
i have been shy to leave the house and try eating out
as i am hesitant to trust that all ingredients are vegan
as it turns_out
woodlands is perfect for people like me
they have a vegan coded menu
where all vegan dishes are marked with a star
making it that much easier to determine what's
safe
for me to eat
they have delicious drinks prepared for the mango lover
they also have pepsi products in a fountain
they use styrofoam plates and cups
the staff are friendly and prompt
our hot dishes were brought to our table minutes or so after ordering
i sampled three sauces from the chutney_bar
i loved all three
the green one was spicy and the red one is a creamy tomato
the black one is like a tamarind_sauce with a pop of sour fruit taste
we ordered poori bread
which comes with two huge puffs of fresh bread
we couldn't finish it
the potato dosai was out_of_this_world good
if you like aloo naan_bread
you will really enjoy this dish
my friend ordered the eggplant curry
and it was as delicious if not better than my dosai
wow
i am planning to come back again this weekend with the boyfriend
so delicious
i can't stop raving to everyone about it
as a person who enjoys
medium
spiced foods
i was very happy with the level of spicy ness in the dishes we ordered
i'm not sure when this place opened
but i cannot believe it took me this long to get here
they have a ton of vegan_options and several gluten_free options which make them hella rad in my book
this is a pay at the counter and eat off of paper_plates type of place
which is fine by me because it keeps the costs down and the portions large
i had the gobi_manchurian
so amazing
and the spiced rice
my dining partner had one of the platters and she was loving every bit of it
i will be back
watch out
i went to this restaurant after a recent health kick
and had heard some good things
so i decided to check it out
the restaurant is more of a order at the counter
fast_food looking atmosphere
i ordered the gobi_manchurian
and the paper masala_dosai
let me just say
the gobi_manchurian is one of the best things i've put into my mouth
and it's vegan
the dosai came to our table
and it was unbelievably big
humorously so
but really tasty
the staff was really friendly
and i can't get enough of the bollywood music_videos
really great food
will be back
i am a meat_eater
but when i do have to eat vegetarian
i prefer south_indian_cuisine
woodlands did_not_disappoint in that department
i cannot tell you what i ate since my friend did the ordering
but everything was really good
we had chick_peas
a huge bread that took up most of the table
and
hamburger buns
with tasty potato filling
i am sure i can close my eyes
point at something on the menu and still find the dish enjoyable
expect a very casual restaurant where you order at the counter and eat from disposable plates
this would also be a great place to order take out from
been to this location many times
both lunch dinner
and the food is always good and filling
i'm a huge_fan_of indian food
both north south
and this place is right up my alley
great food
great prices
speedy service
and always made to feel welcome by the friendly lady behind_the_counter
i've even ordered food from here for a company luncheon event and everyone loved it
have taken many out of town guests here and everyone is always impressed w the food
i've been to many other indian_restaurants around the valley
but this is the one i always come back to
the following are some of my favorites from this restaurant
curry eggplant
palak_paneer
malai_kofta
vegetable manchurian
naan
dosa
i really enjoyed the food here
we stopped in for a casual dinner after being highly_recommended
i left happy
and way more full than i had anticipated
all those light
airy dhosas are deceptively filling
another reviewer was on point by saying that this spot isn't really a restaurant
but more of an eatery or dhosa shop
you order at a counter
take a seat
and your food is brought out to you
pitchers of water are self serve and there is of course a soda fountain
there is also a chutney_bar where you can explore to your heart's content
we brought a sample of each back to the table
each were delicious and fresh
i got the palak_paneer
which was delicious
my friend ordered one of the giant table sized dhosas
of which they were happy to tone down the spice at her request
all in all
everything was great
the only thing i wasn't too crazy about was the plastic
everything
our food was served in dixie bowls and all the silverware was plastic
it sort of felt_like we were camping
the space is clean and bright
i think some real dishes and silverware would really round this place out
at any rate
i will be back
the place is a cross between a takeaway joint and a diner located in the heart of chandler
az
woodlands serves authentic south_indian_cuisine
i would certainly recommend the place if you happen to be around chandler and have a craving for some good dosas or if really hungry
a south_indian thali
four star for ambience
five_star for the food and service
once you get past the average looks the food is great
it also comes quick
sort of like an indian fast_food_joint
oh i am sorry
did you want some food
this seems to be the common theme at all indian food places
i walk in
always seem to be the only or nd customer and the help seems disturbed they have to work
it is just awkward
this trip was no exception
i walked in and looked at the menu for several minutes having no_idea_what to get
or how much to get for dinner for hungry men
i decided to start with one of the potato filled triangle crapes
and then for our main_dish i got and
the first issue we ran into was the soda machine
as they did not expect customers there was no ice in it yet
our crepe came
it was pretty good
and it came with a cup of sauce which we found out was sauce
a crispy crape with a flavorful potato filling
there are many interesting condiments to add to your food
i really enjoyed the spicy red one with carrots
our main_dishes then came
they looked identical
felt nearly identical and almost tasted the same
they were fried soft chucks of veggie mass covered in a sweet crust and a semi spicy sauce
you could have told me they were chinese_food and i would have believed you
all of the grease was a bit too much for me and i cold not finish
also for people is a bit steep of a order at a counter place
main_dishes are and chipati was i would think for one should get both
please tell me what should i order
we ordered the two dinner combos even though it was lunchtime on sunday
the two employees were really slow to take our order yet the food came to our table as soon as we got a pitcher of water and a sample of each thing from the chutney_bar
you bring_your_own pitcher of water and your own plastic forks and spoons to the table
we went in starving and left stuffed
it seemed that more experienced couples ordered just one dinner combo and shared
that would have made more sense once i saw the amount of food we had
plus it would have cost less
we got no drinks for appetizers and the meal was
i loved the crepe thing with potatoe in it
since the menu doesn't really have descriptions i don't know what i ate but everything tasted okay
i didn't love most of it and i didn't really hate anything
not sure i would go back
it felt almost buffet style without you choosing which things from the buffet you want
i prefer other indian_restaurants
we usually do takeout because the interior is pretty drab
but the food is anything but
i have eaten a lot of indian food in many parts of the world
london
new york
toronto
and this restaurant is one_of_my_favorites
though a notch below chutney's on drummond road in london
i highly_recommend the dosas
all are good
and the vegetable_curry is unbelievable
i am not a vegetarian
but if all vegetarian_dishes were as good as those at woodlands
i could easily convert
great food
very tasty and fresh
we loved this place and will_definitely_go_back
incredibly good food and big portions
this is heaven for vegetarians i tell you
i'm not vegetarian far from it
but the flavors in these indian dishes are so phenomenal that woodlands definitely ranks as one of my favorite eateries in the area
i'm always up for something new
and every time i eat here the owner takes time to educate me on new items to try
quick tip
try the masala_dosai and the samosa_chaat
masala_dosai and samosa_chaat are legit
good tasting food
authentic flavor
i drive to artesia
pioneer blvd
sometimes just to fulfill my indian veggie food cravings
ok not really
but i do visit every time i'm in la
this place compares favorably to those places
they have some interesting dishes that are like whitified versions of masala_dosai
like
pav bhaji dosai
maybe this really exists in india
i don't know
i wasn't born there and i haven't been there
but i'd like to think i'm very well connected with my parents culture
i appreciate my indian heritage and culture
anyways
i was surprised that the pav bhaji dosai was actually really good
sambar is decent too
chutney_bar is good
but i think its a little lacking
service is kind of
i don't know
not very welcoming
typical indian style
if you're indian
i think it will suffice
but if you aren't you'll be weirded out
phoenix really lacks south_indian food places
this place somewhat makes up for that
pricing though is not very appealing at all
for a dosa with sambar is wayyy too pricey
so much so that this might deserve a star
but i gotta show some love for indian food
i am of indian origin
so i am picky about indian food at restaurants
i don't eat out much at indian places
so i haven't tracked ownership changes or what that has done for indian_cuisine
i ordered the malai_kofta
which was
might have been reasonable if it had come with a decent portion of rice
and had more than kofta balls in that tangy sauce
or if the extra rice in a thimble wasn't
i have had giant food portion for at sit_down restaurants with amazing ambience
i am not saying the place is expensive
just that the portion was way too tiny even for cheap places
you have to order at the counter
eat off flimsy paper_plates that tip over at the slightest touch and clean up after you but there is a large tip blank on your bill which you have to sign in front of the attendant
and if you eat at indian_restaurants
you know well about the service that leaves you squirming
woodlands was no exception
the chutney_bar was a decent idea the tomato chutney was actually good
i have sort of given up on decent sambhar or chutney
i suggest taking the effort to drive out a couple more miles to little india in tempe
for
you get that same quanity of subji
two rotis
large portion of pulav and pickle
this review is mainly for americans
indians just get desperate and eat at such junkyards
like me
firstly
its owned by an indian and they just want quantity and no quality at all
he did not allow me to order from the kids menu
as i was not under yrs
yes
he was that desperate and disgusting
even when i told_him that the big dosa is too heavy for me
he didnt budge
now for the food
being from bangalore and udupi muself
i really know this kind of food
its like eating a hot dog when you go into an italian restaurant
chutneys cannot be stored for a buffet
its impossible with the rate at which coconut degrades
except the tomato one
so your not eating chutney
but just some stale mustard sauce
the food is so lame
i dont know what to say
but the perfect recipe to fool americans and desperate indians
its also too spicy for american standards and thats too bad
oh and avoid their frozen lassi
its nothing like a mango
india is famous for alphonso mangoes
but this is soooo horrible
better off at buying mangoes from costco and eating it raw
i'm not a veggie but i tend towards veggie food and i do love indian food
i loved the chutney_bar
the only variety i wasn't crazy about was the tamarind but that could have been just me
the portions are amazing for the price when they brought a huge plate of air filled naan
we were amazed and impressed
i have already recommended it a few times and will_be_returning
the best indian food in arizona
bar none
and especially considering the prices and portions
the young guy at the cash_register was incredibly nice and gave my girlfriend and i a free_mango_lassi because he forgot to offer me coffee tea with my meal
the food was spicy
savory
sweet
and succulent
the chutney_bar is a great idea and were likewise delicious
i forgot to tip for all the good food and friendliness
but i'll be back very soon and they will certainly have a couple repeat customers
and a generous tip
i highly suggest this restaurant to anyone that loves indian food
and doubly so to those who are tired of the exorbitant pricing of indian_restaurants in the valley
i am south_indian by background
parents are from south_india
this food is very similar to what my grandmother
from kanniyakumari
would make
just that my grandmother would not make as elaborate sometimes
if you were to ask me about the food
i would say it is good
but my grandmother cooked better
as far as what my wife and i ate
here is the breakdown
i had a mysore masala_dosai
this is very traditional from the mysore area in india
where my mother's side of the family hails from
the dosai was very similar to what i would eat in india
though a bit more elaborate
my wife
who is vietnamese by background
ordered the spinach dosai
she said it was good
as she is used to south_indian food
i never really did see spinach dosai in india before though
regardless
if a person is adventurous
and you are not expecting the standard north_indian mughlai fare
this place is worth going to
i would go back
the atmosphere is more like a fast_food
or cafeteria
but the food is good
i do not want to compare it to elsewhere
as even i would say other places i have lived in the usa
including chicago
have south_indian restaurants that can perhaps compete with this place and win
for the phoenix area
this is good though
we have lived in the area for years learned of this place only months_ago
turns_out it has been open for years upon talking with the gentleman running the place
my wife is vegan
i am not but always up for tasty grub
this place did_not_disappoint
i had the chole dosai while my wife had the vegtable curry
we also got a side of malabar parotta
bread naan
which is to die for and could be a meal in itself
we were both so impressed with portion_size
left_overs came home for a much anticipated lunch the following day
flavor
loved the chutney_bar
and friendly service
the gentleman on multiple occasions queried about or satisfaction
i give this place a very solid
maybe
the only thing that would make it better in my opinion is the ability to order an indian beer and if the prices were a little lower
the atmosphere is on the casual
informal side which i like
our dinner was for with leftovers
very reasonable for dinner for two
really good food but not much ambiance
i was with some indian co_workers who helped me order gluten_free
went for a late lunch on a saturday afternoon
probably about pm
i had to wait for minutes for someone to take my order
looked like it was the manager or owner
he was polite
informed me they were out of a few things already
thought that was poor planning being a holiday weekend and a saturday afternoon
but nonetheless
the food wass fresh and good
the sambar could have been a little thicker and was hoping for the food to be a little hotter
temperature related
will visit again when i am in town
i must admit
i was pleasantly_surprised to have thoroughly_enjoyed everything i ordered
i can't remember the last time that happened in a restaurant in the valley
to start
the ambiance is non existent
so if you want to impress a girl on a first date
this isn't the place
however
if you want to eat food that
wows
you
woodlands is the place to come
i ordered the samosa as an appetizer
and then the veggie curry
along with an order of malabar parotta bread
the samosa had so many spices in it that it was great on its own
however
there are plenty of delicious chutneys to choose from
i loved the mint and coconut
there was also a spicy one with chunks of veggies in it that was good
the curry was fantastic
spicy and full of flavor
i get annoyed when i order spicy in an indian restaurant
and then after looking at me they serve it to me mild not here
it was just right
the bread was excellent too
so was the mango_lassi
though i really wanted a taj_mahal no alcohol here
so besides the cafeteria environment and no alcohol or table service
this place is great
because they serve great food
we tried masala_dosa
grill thali and mango_lassi
the food was fresh and the taste was it should be
the quantity was very good
we will defienetly go to this restaurant again
i am from north india
but a big_fan of south_indian food
first dosa experience and it was wonderful
definitely going back
omg
i feel like i'm on a role with finding half decent indian food
after being here for over years
i'm either finding some good places or my taste_buds have lost their touch
since i refuse to believe the later
i was very happy with this place
great place for dosa
finally i don't have to make it myself
seriously legit dosa
we ordered rasam
the grill thali and a rasmalai
the grill thali is about and is a good start if you want a general idea of what to order in the future
it came with masala_dosa
idlli
vadai
sambhar
and a sweet
gulab_jamun
great value for what you get
the masala_dosa was on par
vadai was made well
idlli was a bit dense and dry
sambhar was flavored well
and gulab_jamun was not frozen
i've found way too many places that store it in the freezer and it kills me every time
the spice_level of the rasam was good but felt_like it was missing something
possibly tamarind
the rasmalai was made well
but a little bit sweeter than i'm use to
all this for approx for
my tummy was happy
woodlands is not the best place ever
but the dosa was good enough to make me want to come back to try the other types of dosa
everything else was satisfactory and edible
i've noticed a lot of ppl critiquing the decor
but heck
it looks like a lot of the great places in artesia
the little india area located in l
a
so please don't come here if you're going to be critical of the cafeteria style
in the months since i have found this place i have eaten here more than once a week
i think even if you are not vegetarian they have the best food on this side of town
the staff are very nice and the orders are filled promptly whether you eat in or carry_out
i have brought all of my friends and family here it is so good
we have a running joke that you can just point to the menu and get something
the real standouts to try are
gobi_manchurian deep_fried cauliflower
chenna batura chickpea_curry
spring dosa rice and lentil crepes
potato bonda breaded potato dumplings like samosas
the place isn't super fancy
it's a simple strip_mall restaurant with really friendly people
i don't find this place very expensive and you get a ton of food wether you eat in or carry_out
i've done both many times
only one word of caution some of the stuff can be very spicy some days
so be a little adventurous and try one of the dishes above i don't think you will be disappointed
we are vegetarians and found woodlands the day we moved to the area
we got the butter masala and the vegetable soup
got take out
the portions were big and prices were good
the masala was wonderful creamy
savory
extra tomato y
and a little bit spicy
which was perfect
i ordered the veggie soup for my lady who was sick that night
and it ended_up being the ideal thing
delicious broth
not too spicy
kind of like the indian equivalent of a good chicken noodle soup
but vegetarian
we will absolutely be ordering from woodlands again what a nice introduction to the phoenix area
edit
we've just ordered take out from woodlands again
probably will happen pretty often
and got the vegetable_curry which was nearly as fantastic as the masala
the order came with a couple yummy sides
a yogurt_sauce and a gingery concoction
we also got the lentil soup this time and wanted to post a warning to fellow yelpers
this soup is so so so so spicy
i absolutely love spicy food and couldn't finish it
not for the faint of heart
went here for lunch with a coworker
and totally loved it
the service is weak
the decor is weak
the process is confusing
the details are lacking
you get cheap paper_plates
if you want water
there's a pitcher
it has about as much ambiance as a circle k
and it would be easy to think they're doing everything wrong from a restaurant experience perspective
but they totally made up for it with the food
i had the spinach dosai
and it was awesome
and i'm no vegetarian
my mouth is watering right now thinking about it
i wanted to go back for dinner that same day
i actually want to go back for dinner right now
so
a carnivore goes into veggie restaurant
no
seriously
this is great stuff
i have a friend who's a veggie and loves indian food
so when i noticed this place sandwiched between a hair salon and a pizza chain
i had to tell her
we checked it out tonight
and damn
the gobi_manchurian is amazing
especially with the mint_chutney
the spinach dosai is very good
but a bit dry
not that that stopped us from fork fighting over the last bits
this unrepentant flesh eater went away completely happy and didn't miss the meat at all
think i'll be coming_back at_least_once_a_week
i'm a regular to this restaurant
being a south_indian myself
i can vouch for their great quality south_indian food
my favourites here are the venpongal vadai
combo variety rice and vegetable uthappam
the food is decently priced
delicious
served quickly and the manager is very friendly and willing to serve
though this is a small restaurant
ive never had to wait to be seated
there is not much of an ambience
but the food makes_up_for_it
woodlands is one of my favorite places to grab lunch
i first learned about it from a fellow indian coworker who was vegetarian and that was the only place he frequented
it's a pretty plain joint
not too big on the decorations
you'll note
but the food is outstandingly flavorful
now don't be fooled and think that just because it's vegetarian that it is going to be completely 'healthy'
that is a very common mis conception and can really eff up your 'diet' if you have that mindset and eat at places like this frequently
cuz i tell ya
they are pretty generous with not only the portions
but to give food some sustenance
you can bet they use cream or ghee
basically butter
to thicken sauces up and the likes
this food is flavorful
for sure
but low in calories it is not
i have tried a few of their thalis
basically sampler dishes which lets you try a variety of things in one sitting and in smaller portions
but still really filling
the palak_paneer
the currys
the aubergine dish called bharwan baiga
gobi manchuria
they were all super delicious
though the aubergine dish is still my favorite
plan on taking leftovers
oh_yeah
and the prices_are_pretty decent and the staff is pretty good
too
i tried this place based solely on the reviews
turns_out the food was delicious
and the prices are more than reasonable
i paid
and ended_up with enough food to feed three people
i will become a repeat customer
for sure
in short
south_indian veg
great taste
quick service
low price
no ambience
no specific seating arrangements
served in plastics
details
every week we used to drive miles from scottsdale to chandler just to eat in woodlands and come back
and my roomie always
and always
eats pongal n vada
while i try out new dish every week
the food
esp
dosa
s
pongal and chole
is of great taste and quality
the quantity is so much more than you could expect
the food comes to your table super quick
the prices are very reasonably low
the owner is very friendly
there is no appreciable
or even noticeable
ambience
the process is
pay the bill then get the food
no specific seating arrangement
served in plastics
bottom_line
this is a place where you dont take you gf or your boss to impress them
this is a place where you treat yourself with great food with low cost
enjoy the taste and forget everything else around you
ohhhh mama
just thinking about woodlands makes my mouth water
i know everything my boyfriend has ever had there he has loved
he tries out new things every time there
i
on_the_other_hand
just stick to what i know and love and crave
the vegetable manchurian
it's spicy
delicious
deep_fried vegetables with a nice cold dipping sauce on the side
the price is great for the awesome amount of food you get
one order is usually two dinners for me
sometimes more
ambience is lacking
but we tend to take our food to go
i just wish they'd open a location closer to tempe
trust_me
you don't go here for the ambiance
there is none
well
unless you count the tons of indians who frequent the joint or the occasional office troupe that takes over one corner
or the couples in for dinner
well basically it's a good place for anyone
what makes woodlands stand out from the other_indian_places in chandler
some that do have 'ambiance'
is that woodlands brings the heat
the chutney_bar has a white coconut_chutney that both cools and has a slight kick
a red tomato chutney with a low soft burn and good flavor
and my personal favorite
the green mint_chutney that will knock your socks off
i only come here for the dosas
the masala_dosa and the mysore masala_dosa are both very good
it seems to me that they use frozen vegetables
but the masala has never tasted bad so there's really no downside
everything is nice and hot when they bring it out
although sometimes the sambar
a soup like dish
might not be if it wasn't as freshly_made
their vadas
spicy
savory fried lentil cakes
are pretty good too
i haven't tried much else but why deviate from what works
the owner is really nice and will chat with you on what to get
family history
etc if you want
i wish they were open later
and on tuesdays
if you're used to sit_down 'classy' restaurants and waiter service
well
you might find this place 'lacking' but honestly
these sorts of places focus on what matters what's on your plate rather than what's on the wall
this is pretty much as_good_as_it_gets in chandler
what this place lacks in interior design
it makes up for in deliciousness
like other reviewers have said
this is not a fancy place
the person who takes your order is not the most outgoing guy on earth
if you want water
you grab a pitcher that they probably bought at wal mart and drink your water from a small styrofoam dixie cup
you eat off of styrofoam plates and bowls
i don't care
the food is awesome and you get a ton of it for the price
i'd eat at this place if i had to sit on the floor and eat with my hands
i always order the palak_paneer it's very good and super spicy
i love it so much i'm afraid to try anything else
the meal comes with rice
i'm not sure if they all do though
if you want bread it's extra
great food
and well worth_the_drive to chandler
easily the best indian food in arizona
my wife and i come here frequently and always get the vegetable_curry
keep up the good work
if you are vegetarian
this is an oasis in this desert
if you just crave something outside of the norm
this is the cure
the food is spicy and delicious
prices for specialty food are decent
the decor is not exceptional
and the utensils are plastic
but the quality of food makes_up_for_it
i have had the paper masala_dosai
paneer dosai
vegetable_curry
vegetable manchurian
my favorite
vegetabel byriani
vada pav and they were all delicious
i recommend you go with a friend so you can try a couple of things
they have a chutney_bar that is quite delicious and adds yet another layer of flavor
pretty good food overall
there's a chutney_bar as well
however
if_you're_looking for a nice sit_down place
this is not what you're looking for
everything is served in styrofoam
but if you're just looking for some good grub you can get it ehre
dosas
yummy
so great for vegans too as everything is labeled
my wife and i wanted to check_this_place_out after reading some of the reviews_on_yelp
first
because we're trying to watch what we eat these days
and also
to try something different
we were not disappointed
we aren't too familiar_with_indian_food
and other than the usual curries and lentils
we had no_idea_what most of the stuff was on the menu
rest assured
the food was fantastic
but perhaps a bit spicy for my wife since she is not accustomed to hot foods
in any case
the food was filling
spicy
and tasty
if_you_are_looking for something different and something healthy and vegetarian
give this place a try
my first impression
wasn't too good as it looked not so good
they really should fix up the place
the food on_the_other_hand
great vegetarian menu
dosa was tasty
had also dahl with rice
very good
they even have choices of chutney
i do recommend to anyone
even meat_eaters
finally writing a review after i have been eating here for a couple years now
this place is hands_down the best south_indian food you will find in the valley
they do such an incredible job with the spices
the owner is really nice
he remembers that i cannot eat raw onions
they did not even know that they were nominated for best vegetarian restaurant this year in the new times
it was just business as usual
do not go here expecting to have a fine dining_experience
you order at the counter
either take it to go
or sit in the dinner atmosphere and eat some crazy good food
friendly atmosphere
lots of families in to eat
everything is great
but the paneer butter marsala is one_of_my_favorites
one word for this place
yummmmy
i give stars for the food
we had the chole masala dosi and pav bhaji masala dosi and they were delicious
love_this_place
this is top_notch
delicious food
my friend from mumbai told me that it is as
authentic as you can get here in the us
and i believe her
here's the thing
heretofore i couldn't eat indian food
whereas my wife would have had it fed to her intraveneously if possible
now
when we go to woodlands
i eat everything and love it
paneer is phenomenal
chenna battura
sp
brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it
i have ordered
devoured
and thoroughly_enjoyed about of the menu
to further expound
i could give a crap about ambiance
as long as i am not in a dangerous or filthy place
woodlands is immaculately clean and in an upscale chandler location
really could not care less about the lack of interior decor or the fact that they use styrofoam cups and plates
which
from what i understand
is a significant
upgrade
from what you can expect in a south_india marketplace
not here for a luxurious dining_experience
just to eat
and eat i do
in a clean
friendly
well served location that offers delicious
authentic_indian_food
ps
if you ever travel outside the us you'll find that about of the world doesn't eat in restaurants like our spoiled fat butts they eat in a market or order from street vendors
compared to this
woodlands is off the chart in terms of luxury and taste
and
again
compared to all other indian food
which i could not eat before
this is the best
prices cannot be beat
go there and check it out
my favorite indian takeout place in the valley
i specify takeout because i wouldn't necessarily eat there at the restaurant
as other people have mentioned
the decor is kind of generic and odd
the food
however
man
so good
i especially recommend the butter paneer masala
pretty reasonable priced
too
very nice setup
great food and service and very reasonable_prices
looks can be deceiving
the interior is
well it's a restaurant and they have tables
that's about as fancy as it gets
however
the food is absolutely incredible
the service is quick and excellent
the owner is very polite and helpful
the butter paneer masala and manchurian vegetable are my two favorites
and everything i've had has been stellar
first impressions can be a little off putting
but once you try their dishes
the ambiance doesn't seem to matter
woodlands serves freshly cooked indian food at very affordable prices at around per each main_dish
my friends who are originally from india recommended this place and took me here while i was in town visiting them to enjoy some great south_indian dishes
there's a small chutney_bar where you can get your favorite chutney just to snack on or to dip your favorite bread crepe in thee
too
we order chole batura
saag_paneer
masala_dosa and chole chaat mango_lassi
they tasted terrific
the store is very low key and the ambiance isn't that great
there are just around tables at most and you may end up sitting in front of the restrooms
but the food is super fresh and tasted great
made from scratch daily and upon your order
very good tasty food
not too spicy for my taste
compare to little india
a little too spicy for me
here r what we ordered
spinach dosai
if u r into spinach
chenna batura
stars for me
mini masala_dosai
big portion
stars for me
paneer butter masala
stars
taste like meat dish but it is not
we will try other stuff on the menu for our next visit
possibly the only vegetarian place i will eat regularly
i initially wanted to work through the entire menu but started craving items i enjoyed i started going back to them
lunch_specials are super filling for the price
plates and stuff are cheap but whatever the food makes_up_for_it
oh yes and the chutney_bar is awesome
and the pickled hot stuff whatever it is is so bomb
i could eat a bowl of just that
ok
don't plan on being impressed with the atmosphere
you will be served on paper_plates
however
what is put on those paper_plates in divine nectar
this is a big step above the original famous woodlands restaurant in rishikesh
unrelated
i asked the owner in rishikesh
he is livid about all the imitations
the food here is amazing
beware
closed tuesdays
drove hours from chino valley one time to find that out the hard way
also
please note that
south_indian
means hot
if you want it mild
you need to tell them
the owners are very sweet attentive
as well as the mexican waitress
always packed full of indian customers authentic
the only indian restaurant i found in az to compare to this one is the govindas in tucson
this is a family_run business
the owners are the cooks
you can watch them prepare the food
best food
best price
very clean
i love indian food
this place is great
my couple friends from india spoke badly of this place
however
upon reflection
i can't think of a time where any indian friends
have ever given a favorable review of any indian_restaurants
i ate here and loved it
i got the dosa with spinach filling
of course i doused it with with tons of chutneys too
i loved it
nice and spicy
every indian i know always compares it with their mothers cooking
of course each indian is from a very specific part of india and the cooking varies regionally
so i guess i can no longer listen to my indian friends regarding indian restaurant reviews
i mention this because i think it might be a cultural phenomenon
which many others might confirm
service is fast
paneer dosa
idlis and some curry which the owner recommended were good
ambiance not that great and better for take out than dine in
the cost is reasonable but for some reason i felt i was overcharged on two occasions
the food is absolutely_amazing
however
keep in mind it's south_indian food
which means it's on the spicy side
i had the lemon_rice and also the dosa with spinach filling
of course i doused it with with tons of chutneys too
sorry scott b
i plagerized from your review
i loved it
nice and spicy
i also got the cauliflower with chili sauce
yum
don't expect ambiance
it's all about the cooking
my indian friend loves it
she raves about this and drives from n phoenix to the woodlands about once a week
definitely go and give it a try
good south_indian food
casual seating but that's fine when you don't need fancy place but want good vegetarian dosas
my last visit was not pleasant though
there are lots of flies inside the restaurant especially on top of chatani area
not very appetizing
this restaurant was recommended to be years_ago by a native indian but i didn't get around to trying it until now
my bad because the food was awesome
i hadn't had south_indian food since actually being in india in so this was a real treat for me
i ordered the malai_kofta
i'm a creature of habit
this is what i almost always get
a side of iddly and the paper masala_dosai
the spice was just right
hot enough to make me sweat but not real indian hot which is slightly too much for me
the dosai was thin and crispy on the edges and spongy in the middle perfect
my_only_complaint is that the malai_kofta was a little chewy
slightly overlooked maybe
but the sauce was so delicious that it hardly matters
they give you a ton of food too
i'll probably be eating delicious leftovers for two days
definitely a place i would go to again
oh and they had freshly_made jelebis that were so good
my fianc and i devoured the entire package
edited to add
the second time i ordered malai_kofta the lentil balls were perfect and not at all chewy
this is definitely my new favorite indian restaurant
absolutely love
love
love woodlands food
feel at home there
finger licking delicious food
authentic
yummy
quick
concise and to the point
this is my new favorite spot
referring friends here
fantastic food
one star off for spork
really
how do you eat indian with a flimsy plastic spork
get real dinnerware and i will change report to five_stars
i work at intel down the road and me and my coworker order from this place once a week
the palak_paneer
masala butter paneer
and the gobi_manchurian are freaking amazing
the guy at the counter which i believe is the owner is always really nice
and says
hey you're that guy from intel
you still working
we usually call up the order and go pick_it_up minutes_later
definitely highly_recommend this place if you like indian food
oh
the food
i would say it is on par with anandas
it is spicy
more of a kick than seems typical
but i like it like that
where i start deducting points first is the overuse of styrofoam and the very non sustainable serving process
most everything is served in styrofoam
even the drinks
the eating utensils are very small and very flimsy plastic
this is a deal breaker
i can forgive the non friendly demeanor of the guy behind_the_counter
and the below par ambiance
but considering they're investing very little in the experience
the prices should also reflect this
love the food
really tuned off by everything else
i literally could not stop_eating
i ordered the chenna batura
otherwise
curried garbanzo beans with puffy bread or even easier
it was so satisfying that i ordered a second one to go so i could take it home and indulge over the weekend
the decor and ambiance was not the greatest
but really
who cares when the food is to die for
i will be making this my official
place to go when i can not decided what i want to eat
because i know it will always be satisfying no_matter_what type of food i am in the mood for
i ate here for the first time today with a friend who is a vegetarian_vegan i however am not so i was skeptical
i ate my words and my weight in paneer butter masala the food was sooooo good
we also had the dosa and the flat naan like bread
i don't recall the name
but i couldn't stop_eating it was all so delicious
the chutneys where good and i loved the coconut the best although spice they had some delicious flavors definitely a new favorite spot
i was stuck in a remote town in the desert of arizona and desperate for some real food so we found this indian restaurant listed about minutes away and began the trek
woodlands is a vegetarian south_indian restaurant located in chandler
arizona about minutes south of phoenix
when we arrived
we immediately realized it wasn't all i thought it would be
located in a strip_mall
it was a tiny little take out joint with inside seating for about
we took a look at the menu and were pleased to see items that were marked
vegan
so we ordered and took a seat at a booth
the restaurant had a plain interior with cheap tables and black chairs
towards the back
there was a toppings bar with lots of options
we chose the hot peppers to add to everything we had ordered and waited for our food
we started with the iddly steamed rice and lentil cakes
these plain
mostly flavorless cakes were served with a somewhat runny sauce that left much to be desired
that's not to mention that everything was served on styrofoam plates
which i only tend to see in cities in the middle of nowhereland
so weird
for our entrees
we ordered two curries
i had the vegetable_curry that had green beans and cauliflower in a coconut tomato based curry
my friend ordered the dhall curry
which had lentils with mustard
cumin
and spices
neither of them were anything special
and we also asked for super spicy
but they weren't spicy at all
we also ordered the parotta kurma
which turned_out_to_be really odd
they took the bread and sliced it up into pieces
then put a red curry on it
the bread was chewy and slightly spicy
but just odd
all in all
it wasn't worth_the_drive out
the guy at the counter wasn't very helpful or personable
the meal was mediocre at best
and the entrees at
each really could be priced less for what we received
oh
and the styrofoam and paper_plates for those dining in the dining_room were pretty tacky
well
this is how i first felt when i got my food food on styrofoam plates and cups
seriously
i feel guilty to spoil mother earth with so much plastic shit
the food is not cheap
why cannot they serve food on the proper plates and cups
i guess it was not a good day to go to woodlands for us
we ordered masala_dosa
idli and vada combo
dosa was only cooked one side and when i told the lady about it she told me something ridiculous thinking i do not know how to make dosa myself
and idlis were not bad but vada had that stale oily smell
you know what i mean right
my hubby ordered bisibelebath
his all time fav
which was not bisi
means hot
at all
it was cold
i am never ever going to this place
all you green lovers out there
i highly_recommend avoiding this place to avoid seeing so much plastic plates
cups
spoons
forks
etc
and believe me the prices are comparable to other indian_restaurants out there
its a bummer that it is so bad
me being a vegetarian
i will have one less place to choose
one of my favorite places for take out
the menu has lots of selections and it's a vegan paradise
the food is consistently outstanding
try it all
the vegetable_curry is my favorite
this place just opened up about a week ago
and i think it's a great addition to the indian_restaurants in the valley
my husband and i went to eat dinner here last_night and
even late on a monday
it was crowded
beware it's a small space
so if you are going on a weekend
i would call for reservations
the restaurant
located next to the india plaza on apache blvd
is really inviting it's decorated with bright colors
nice
thick tables and contemporary lights and wall hangings
it has quite a different feel than most indian_restaurants in the valley
it has fun
upbeat music_playing too
although i think it could have been turned down a little to make it easier to talk
i loved the menu
because it is quite varied
offering the 'usual' suspects as well as some different items like goan fish_curry
bitter melon curry
goat curries
and gobi_manchurian
and
it also serves chaat
my husband and i
however
decided to stick with the more typical offerings for the night
he got the
la jawab kadahi gosht
which was lamb pieces and veggies in a spicy yogurt_sauce
it was seasoned really well and delicious
i ordered the malai_kofta
which was also delicious and seasoned just perfectly
the rice and naan we ordered were tasty
and i loved the side of raita instead of just a simple yogurt and cucumber dish that the restaurants around here typically serve
this raita had some veggies mixed in and
i think
little puffed wheat pieces
yum
all the food comes in copper bowls and plates
too
which i love
the service was quite friendly
albeit a little slow
it took a while to get our food
however
we felt that was more to do with ironing out some first week kinks
rather than an indicator of anything more serious
if you like indian food
i would definitely recommend giving this place a try
went for lunch with a friend
i had the bhatinda lamb special
very good
the portion was modest
but fine for the avg
appetite in context with the other stuff
and the price included naan
rice
and a couple of other sides
my friend ordered a vindaloo dish
which was a tad more in price and was just the curry
for him
the rice naan was an add on
it was a larger serving
but i think he felt a tad confused due to the different offerings included in my order
also
he felt it was pretty mild
though the menu and waiter mentioned it would be spicy hot
we mentioned this to the manager and he said that requesting more heat was an easy thing for them to do
so if you like to sweat when eating vindaloo
and other indian_fare
just be sure to make it clear when ordering
in any case
it was a first visit so i'm not sure which are the best things to order and if ordering a combination what is the best plan
i would venture to guess
however
that it would be a great place to go with a small group
then order a variety of things and share
okay
so i know you are wondering
what's with the stars
fine
that skepticism is warranted so the answer is a very simple
grade inflation
as in grade inflation for phoenix indian_restaurants
we all know the indian_restaurants are terrible in phoenix in general so the ones that are pretty good deserve higher_than normal grades
don't_get_me_wrong
my expectations were exceeded when i dined at
the
dhaba
guru palace is still better and in regards to food
i would say royal taj is slightly better but the dhaba is a strong rd place
and in terms of the overall total package
i would rank the dhaba the nd best indian restaurant in the city
the ambience reminds me of the contemporary small joints you see in nyc or sf
the restaurant is narrow yet not claustrophobic
the style is contemporary with nice mood lighting to give it a comfortable 'lounge
like feel to it
they have the standard flat screen television with bollywood playing
there are two servers
there is a non indian server and an indian server
luckily we got the indian server because the other one just seemed a little strange like the reviewer below said
i thought the service was pretty good
no
our waiter didn't exchange pleasantries or talk to us but he was efficient
water was continuously replenished in our cups which was a nice change for an indian restaurant
a big hit with me were the plates and cutlery
they were all metal including the cups which provides an additional authentic feel of dining in india
the water especially tastes cooler when it's served in a metal cup
and just to avoid confusing people
there are two parts to dhaba
they have a fast_food like chaat place which is next_door to its restaurant component
we dined at the restaurant
the food
the food was well prepared
the texture especially was captured right
the chicken_tikka_masala was creamy and not runny
the quality of the chicken included thick chunks of white chicken_breast
the saag_paneer had a nice smooth pureed consistency but it wasn't runny
my favorite aspect was the naan which had amlost a paratha texture to it with flaky layers yet it was baked and crunchy on the outside but wasn't burned
the rice wasn't dry or overcooked like you receive at most indian_restaurants
in terms of heat
it was perfect
it wasn't too hot or mild
i though they really nailed it there
so what was missing
flavor
the food didn't lack flavor but it did lack that addictive quality that makes you want to come back by yourself and just chow down when you just got finished working out for hours
oh
don't_get_me_wrong
food was tasty and far better than of the indian_restaurants in the valley including some vaunted favorites like dehli palace in tempe
india_palace on th and bell
tandoori_times and maharaj palace to name a few
the malai_kofta was arguably the best in the city the only weak dish was the saag_paneer
yes they got the texture right but it was a bit plain and it could have used more spice
something that deserves mention was the chaat
we ordered the samosa_chaat
the chaat actually contained normal amounts of samosa as opposed to one small piece of samosa and just tons of sauce
the samosa and the chole were very well prepared and it wasn't drowned in sauce
it was also fairly big and it was more than enough to feed two people
other things worth mentioning
we had two white guys playing the sitar and tabla
talk about ironic but the fact is they were really good sothere was a live music component
the place was also packed and there were people waiting outside to enter which i have never seen at an indian rest
in the valley so something is working
finally
the food was priced fairly
we ordered dishes
naan
rice
appetizer and two soft_drinks for
not bad for an indian restaurant
the same would have cost us about at another indian restaurant
this place is worth taking a date to or a group of friends as it's ambience is hip enough that if you don't like the food
your friends won't think you took them to some cheap restaurant
in other words
it's a good place to take people who have never eaten indian food
my recommendation is that you arrive before
because after that
the place gets packed
if you go before
the crowd is mostly non indians and the date crowd
after
you have large groups of indian families dining and so the waiting line can be extensive and the tables can get packed
my only criticism
if there is one
is the lack of enough of waiters and the length of time it took to bring the food out
we ordered our food at
and didn't receive it until
and the place wasn't busy at the time
therefore
i could imagine that it could get much worse if you get there past
or pm on friday and saturday
i went here on a friday_night with recommendations from a few indian friends
i was very disappointed with the vegetarian selection
of the
traditional
indian drink selection
they were completely out of all the drinks
i asked for my curry
hot
really hot and spicy
it was not
we had a group of and half of our table had to wait for silverware after their food arrive
then it took them about minutes to bring us our check
nor did we get any water refills
all night
it was a bad time all round
before beginning with my review
i would like to critic
on something that i read through a lot of reviews here for
the
dhaba
there is no f variable spice_level in indian food
i get enraged when people say these things as if these are the conventions for food
most of the indian recipes
at least
are prepared with a predetermined spice_level
how do you want your food
mild medium or spicy
is the dumbest thing i have come across in my entire restaurant life
there are some recipes that are supposed_to_be spicy and some are supposed_to_be medium and some sweet
reason being indian spices range way more than just chilly for heaven's sake
thai restaurants vary spice_level just by adding more chili
indian spices are way more than just chili and you can not add subtract spices like chili sauce since spices are added during the process of cooking and not on top as garnishing
in short
mild
medium or spicy
is like asking what kind of a football player do you want for your team
fast
faster or fastest
well
quarterback position needs a fast player
tight ends could be faster but wide receivers need to be the fastest
but you can not f switch and play the game
all right
about the restaurant
my opinion is that if you wish to have real indian food
you have to go to cities other than phoenix
or even better
go to india
i have been to some indian_restaurants in houston
washington dc
new york
san diego
new jersey and a few more places and all places have much better indian_restaurants than in our valley
but if it comes to sticking to the choices we have around
i would rank
the
dhaba as the most
close to actual
indian food that you have get
jewel of the crown ranks probably the second
but overall
all indian_restaurants around here are good for some particular things on the menu and worse for others
dhaba comes to being better for almost everything on the menu
chicken_tikka_masala
butter_chicken
related dishes are very good
all lamb dishes are nice and authenticated
vegetarian_options are awfully limited compared to what it should be considering its an indian restaurant
common restaurants in india have at least more vegetarian items on their menu
no kidding
but overall i am very pleased with the range of quality here at the dhaba
garlic naan's are way too good to resist
tea
complimentary
is very close to what people in india drink
almost all non vegetarian_dishes and paneer_tikka_masala or mixed_vegetables are tasty
somebody wrote about salads and i would like to remind that salads are not indian because other green vegetables are very common in regular diets
and yeah
if you like indian music
they have live music these days on the weekends
i guess
and though i have never been there for the music
i bet that would be cool
after dining here a couple of more times
i would have to give this restaurant
stars
the chicken_tikka was very disappointing
it was not served on a sizzling clay plate as it should be
the chicken did not taste grilled
it was microwaved and served on a plate
the flavor was also lacking
honestly
this is very amateurish and they simply cannot serve tandoor like this
also
the water was not served chilled with ice
it was served tapwater temperature and thus your thirst didn't feel quenched
the vegetarian sabjis outside of palak panner and malai_kofta was average
again
i dined here two more times after this and the quality of the food took a dip
went there with a friend for chaat
snack
and chai
we had the bombay bhel_puri and the amritsri samosa_chaat
the samosa dish was perfectly_cooked and everything was nice and spicy
i walked into this place thinking
oh man
you know the americans
white dudes
are going to love_this_place
flat screen tv's
nice tables
friendly service
trendy ambience
waiters who speak good english
white guy playing sitar at the front
this is white guys paradise
unfortunately the food itself was just above_average
fyi
indians from india
my parents
call all white dudes
americans
as if we are not americans but i thought would throw some humor your way in case you were already bored reading the typical
the spiciness wasn't there
review
in terms of the menu
i don't think dhaba knows how it's trying to position itself
are they a chaat house
a classic indian restaurant
a fusion indian restaurant
and that is the problem with this place
it's a smorgasboard
a jack of all trades yet a master of none
and that's exactly felt in the cuisine
the samosa_chaat was amazing
the other chaat
bleh
the chicken_tikka masa was very good but the certainly not crave worthy meaning it lacked the
hey i'm dying for some great chicken_tikka_masala
let me order this to go
quality
it's really hit_or_miss with their dishes as some are completely amateur like their chicken_tikka
not the curry but the grilled version
which tasted like chicken cooked on a forman grill and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served on a plate
not exactly appetizing
their daal was really good but their saag was okay
and to wendi below
we don't eat salads
indian people created salads for you guys
so when you tell me there is a new salad on the menu each day
i envision someone at a chinese restaurant saying we are offering a different style of pizza today
that's a not a good thing
if the guy is listening to pink floyd
that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter
what's next
are they going to start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate
don't_get_me_wrong
dhaba is one of the few indian_restaurants in phoenix that i will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's not me being critical
phoenix is a great place for bad indian_restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think it's a legitimate and authentic dish
and this goes for the white dudes living in london who comes on these forums and tells us they know great indian food when they give places like india gate stars
but i digress
okay so if you are not an indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at black angus
this is a good place to start
if you have eaten great indian food and are not easily mesmerized by a nice_atmosphere go down mcclintock and take a left on broadway and try royal taj
this has been a staple in my life for the last two years
i have eaten there on busy nights
on slow afternoons and i have ordered taken out
i don't vary from what i order and i am always satisfied
i will agree with most the reviews below that the services has been very weak in the past
everything from uninterested waiters that i had to pry recommendations out of
to pushy waiters that try to force stuff on me
i didn't want the damn chi tea
i don't care if it came with the meal
it tasted like crap anyway
while normally i don't care much about how soon they get my water filled
when i am eating curry that tends to be pretty spicy
i need water
now
after that rant about the service
i will say one last little negative thing
i order the meal special
and with out fail every time the desert has changed
i'm not complaining because it is always good
but can we get some consistency here
but
sometimes
i needed dhaba curry
i need to so bad
nothing will satisfy until i have it
now with so many good things going for it
i did leave the dhaba slightly indifferent
you see when i order and eat
i'm pretty much a total top
while i am open to suggestion
i have a good idea of what i want and how i want it
during my visit
not only was i flipped but i didn't have much say in the matter
please don't_get_me_wrong
our server was friendly however
every time when one of us ordered something
he would tell us that he would order something better for us to enjoy
for me
i was dead set on ordering several wraps and rolls called sada bahar
what i ended_up with was far from what i originally envisioned
while i did get my way with a few appetizers
i have to say not only was i pleased with his domineering ordering selections
but would eagerly let him order again for me
street_food called chaat
is to indian cooking as dim sum is to chinese
usually a small plate with around servings varying in preparation
and with enough variety to make a meal out of
starting with the amritsri samosa_chaat
these are a deep_fried triangular dumpling filled with a mixture of potatoes
onions and chili
served with a spicy yogurt_sauce
perfectly crunchy and not a drop of oil
just breaking into one of them was a delight as the fragerent steam escaped
it was aromatherapy indian style
ambala tiki chaat
was more of a composed small plate
a couple of potato pancakes
layered with garbanzo beans
onions
and garnished with fresh mint tamarind_chutney and yogurt
the flavor components with indian cooking are generally very complex
this plate was a great example of complexity and harmony
each bite had varying degrees of spicy and sweet then a slightly sour finish from the chutney
complexity doesn't quite work like with the kolkata pani puri
these are round hollows
fried crisp and served with a watery mixture of tamarind
chili and potatoes
the idea is to spoon in some of the mixture into each puri
then pop into your mouth
while the texture was nice
the flavors just never came together and ended_up just tasting weird
this is the part where he took over and assured us what he was ordering was going to be quite good
as the dishes came out we weren't quite sure what was what
so we just dug in
eventually we got clarity and just continued to share
family_style
arriving on a sizzling iron skillet covered with peppers and onions
the chicken_tikka kabob
was not only a dramatic presentation coming from the kitchen
but the colors were vivid and bright
large pieces of boneless skinless chicken_breast are rubbed with spices then grilled
resulting in a beautiful yellow color
the chicken was tender and moist yet had a slight smokiness that added another welcome dimension
served in a large basket were piles of hot freshly baked naan
per order
the thick and tender bread was a welcome site since i was wanting a wrap to begin with
plain
garlic and chili each flavor welcomes dipping
wrapping and scooping of sauces and meats
loving yogurt
the creamy tang of the kashmiri chicken_tikka_masala
was a welcome surprise
this is where the naan really came into play by making good use of the tender pieces of chicken and yogurt_sauce
sopping up as much of the delicious sauce as i could
interactivity is just part of the experience
with so many different spices and spiciness
the mango_lassi
was as welcome as the rain
yogurt and water mixed with sugar and mango was cooling and refreshing
with the addition of a fruit puree on the inside of the glass
made this version different than others ive tried
though the effect was still the same
at the end of the meal we were brought out a bowl of rice_pudding with a scoop of pistachio ice_cream
while the sliced dates and papaya were pretty to look at
none of the flavors made much sense together
complaining aside
this did arrive complimentary
who knows
maybe for being a good sports
we were also brought out another off menu item
it was a thick
flaky and buttery paratha
similar to a flour tortilla
this particular version was filled with pureed cherry and sprinkled with anise seeds
after only one taste we were hooked
the group of us made short order of the warm tender layers
you might have to ask for this one to be made special
our server actually told us how soldiers in the hills of afghanistan
would make these since it didn't take to many ingredients or tools
he stared blankly out the window as he told the story
perhaps of his own personal experience building make shift clay ovens
alright
so sometimes letting go can be a hard thing to do
after this experience
its actually kind of nice sitting back and enjoying the surprises the kitchen has in store
i am by no means an expert on india cuisine
my experience is limited to dozens of buffets and a single non buffet experience a friend took me to in manhattan
while that was good
this was awe inspiring
the dhaba is not a buffet restaurant
they serve fresh punjabi food and have an extensive_menu
but not at lunch during the week
their innovative approach is to rotate through the best items on their menu each week
we ate their on a thursday
we skipped the two vegetarian entrees and went straight for the chicken and lamb
both were melt in_your_mouth outstanding
both were spiced for flavor
not simply heat
i'm a huge_fan_of hot food
but it wasn't until driving out of the parking_lot that i realized how not hot the food had been
amazing
we had the mur lasuni tikka
chicken
and the kali marichi ka gosht
lamb
served family_style
with fantastic madras lentils
they probably call it something different
yogurt_sauce
taziki
naan that perfectly complimented the meal instead of overpowering it
and a lovely salad with a mango and lots of other good stuff dressing
the lovely lady there took the time to explain everything to us and made the experience that much better
and since they rotate the lunch menu every day during the week full menu on the weekends and for dinner i have good reason to return at least four more times this month
ambiance provides the right feel for indian_cuisine
including the copper rimmed tableware that i like
several lunch_specials that include salad
soup
rice
entree
and naan were priced reasonably
service was pleasant
food was middle of the road
soup size was a little small
naan was dense
thin
and chewy
not bad overall
but could be better
owner contacted me regarding my experience and i have good assurance it will be better next time
and i'll certainly return
great to see proprietors that truly care
a disaster
we were told it would be an_hour wait
no problem
it was a little over an_hour
but still
no problem
it's
pm
no waiter until pm
nothing
nada
then
we tried to order a bottle_of_wine
selection
oh
we're out of
selection
let me see
no
we're out of that one
my husband gamely tries another selection
they come back with
we're out of that as well
perhaps you might like the merlot
the food arrives
blessedly
quickly
it's mediocre indian
we've lived in major metropolitan areas and just weren't impressed
the menu
at first glance
is impressive
but the food was just above_average
one last note
the alley shaped space is a noise box
be prepared to yell your thoughts across the table
so much for a nice night out
update the owner offered us a dinner in response to our disappointment
we responded that
rather than that
that he ensure that no future diners experienced what we experienced
i'll give him another star for trying to remedy the situation
you have to have a picky indian to recommend and suggest a menu for you to enjoy this place
we had a good offer for a menu that included
pappad chutnies
appetizer samosa pakora
a chicken dish
malai_kofta
vegetable fritter in a tomato cream_sauce
daal
naan
rice
ras malai
dessert
and of course chai
everything tasted really good and was more than enough to leave us satisfied
it is a bit small
but cozy
and the owners were around
so we had a really good attention
unlike other
indian places
this one had much more flavor
good thing is around the corner from where i live
i probably will not be back here again
and will not suggest anyone try this restaurant
i saw in the new times'
best of
review that it mentioned
this stylish place is almost always packed with young indian families
dude
really
that doesn't indicate that it's good
it just means it's the trendy and hip place to go
i mean
the decor is much better than most other indian food places i've been
it's fresher and newer
it has windows
the food is meh
paneer_tikka_masala sauce tasted like a creamy campbell's tomato_soup
malai_kofta was also super creamy
we asked for spicy food
but we did not get spicy food
the mint cilantro chutney on the table was spicier than our entrees
two good things the mango_lassi and the naan
i'm not sure if i was expecting too much and got caught up in all the hype surrounding this place
but i have to say
meh
i've experienced better
the taste of the food wasn't anything that left me saying
i must return here
i can't even remember what kind of curry i ordered
but it didn't come with rice
so there was an extra charge
bummer
my friends ordered dhaba thalis
which is kind of a sampler dish
and i'll give credit to the dhaba for loading the food on there
perhaps that's the way to go here
the service was also not impressive
it wasn't bad
but it was just
slow
the girl who was our waitress kept coming_back to our table without food to tell us the status of our food and that it was going to be delayed
i suppose that's a courteous gesture
but at some point
i got to thinking
just come back when you have food
though i'm giving the dhaba only stars
i give their mango_lassi and their decor stars
check it out
overall
i found this place decent enough
but i've had better
the food at the dhaba deserves about or
stars based_on food alone
it's not bad
but it's also not that great
my husband and i got the item thali plates
so we tasted of their curries in total
like other reviewers noted
the food is
meh
the main problem is that that the dishes are extremely bland
i love indian food to have rich spices
textures
tastes
this seemed watered_down
the decor of the dhaba is about stars
it's very nicely_decorated
the restaurant is small
but well laid_out
the service is about stars as well
our waitress was prompt
and courteous
the only difficulty is that she was very soft spoken
ie
a low talker
on several occasions
we asked her to repeat herself
overall
meh
with nice decor
for a student like me who is away from home
does not like to cook and has limited money
dhaba is the best place to eat
their afternoon meals are just perfect for students
fits the pocket
fills the stomach and the food is amazing
i love their mutton dishes
they are very well prepared and are mouth_watering
hmm my mouth is already watering
lol
this is my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in the valley
their curries are very flavorful and spicy
i usually get their vindaloo
although i've had the dhaba curry
and a couple others
both lamb and chicken
the naan is great
and we've been given a couple desserts on the house that were fun and interesting
they do a good job of trying to find some stuff for our kids to eat
but we usually just bring something along for them to have with basmati_rice
my wife gets their chiken tikka masala
and she loves it
we often go here for lunch
which is not a buffet
which we prefer
i used to live in central phoenix and loved flavors of india
since_moving to mesa
i just hadn't seen or found a good replacement until i tried the dhaba
the service was a little slow at times
but the overall atmosphere was friendly and inviting
the food came out hot and was flavorful
with a hint of spice
and delicious
both the plain and garlic_naan were crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside
the perfect combination
there is also a small
but decent
selection of indian beer
and though the food came out in what appeared_to_be somewhat small dishes
we had enough leftovers to take home and make another meal
i was so pleased with my evening at the dhaba
their food was really good
their ambience was so much better than a lot of mom and pops and the neighboring shops are just charming
the grocery_store next_door had so many interesting foods and condiments
one thing that struck me was that no matter which box of prepackaged meals i picked_up
the ingredient list was all of real food and spices
no ingredients you couldn't pronounce
what a novel idea
i'm excited to bring my indian friend here
she and i have eaten at many indian places around the valley and i really think she'll love_this_place
for dinner
i had the ambala tiki chaat as an appetizer
wonderful
and tikki_masala
as good as many i've had
and lahori malai_kofta which is a vegetarian substitute for meatballs
it consists of dumplings made out of paneer
cottage_cheese
cauliflower florets
carrots and potatoes in a rich and creamy sauce
i'd never had it before
but recommend it highly
i'll be back to the dhaba again very soon
let me just start by saying that i had stopped going out to eat at north indian_restaurants in the phoenix area for a while
since i could not find one that satisfied me
having been born and brought up in india
i always compared them to what the real thing is supposed to taste like and none met my liking
i tried the dhaba
a little while ago and was very pleasantly_surprised by the taste and quality
the food was quite authentic and i visit there frequently
i have tried quite a few things on the menu and the chicken and mutton selections are very good
but the winner is
insert drum roll here
the maa ki daal
black daal
it truly reminded_me_of home
the phoenix area has quite a few indian_restaurants but none that i would re visit
now i have finally found one that has good punjabi food
btw
the chaat cafe next_door is pretty good too
when i don't feel like a regular meal and am craving some good
street
food
this is my choice
hope this place stays around
so i can have a place to satisfy my indian food cravings
this was another groupon find of mine
although i had heard about it
in a not so good light
from a friend
however
i do love me some indian food
so i grabbed my partner and headed over there
the groupon was for
and at most places
if get get apps
food
dessert and iced_tea
we hit that mark
not here
we each order the fanciest thali they had
comes with salad
naan
biranyi rice
desser
chai
mini mango_lassis
dal and two veggie dishes
but they were only a piece
so we wound up ordering two more starters
the potato pancake chaat and fried paneer
in order to hit our price point
and then we took a lot of food home
the mango_lassis were delicious
as was the salad
i wasn't such a fan of the chaat it was a little too spicy and a little too mushy
i loved the fried paneer
but who doesn't love fried_cheese
it was great with the tamarind_chutney
as far as the main meal
i loved everything
though next time
will go with plain basmati_rice
i especially enjoyed the paneer_tikka_masala and the malai_kofta
my_favorite_dish ever
the dal was good i've_never_seen kidney beans in it before
but i liked it
the only thing i didn't absolutely love was the saag_paneer the texture was too smooth
however
my partner scarfed it down
for dessert
i was expecting rice_pudding
or the sweet balls
instead
our awesome server asked if we'd tried carrot fudge
we hadn't
so she brought that out
i liked it
except for the sultana raisins
i hate raisins
it didn't hit_the_spot for my partner though
and the chai wasn't as strongly spiced as i like
plus i prefer honey to sugar packets as far as sweetening it
we'll_be_back
for sure
i might go with a small thali
but it's a really good deal
and an excellent amount of good food for the value
glad i found it
i have been to this place only once which was like years back
one thing that stick'd out for me was the colorful interior with the theme of indian flag
we were a group of and we had a good time in their just having fun and enjoying the food
they served in copper plates and copper tumblers
the food was excellent we pretty much ordered the whole vegetarian menu n like a chicken dish
the taste reminded of food back home
they even had a big screen tv playing indian music_videos
some of musics were the once we grew_up with
brought back memories
me n my friends still talk about the food in dhaba n the experience we had in there
a memorable time to cherish and maybe go visit this place one day
i went to this restaurant with my wife and ordered roghan gosh and chicken_makhani
the food was delicious
we complimented this meal with onion and special naan
which was an excellent choice
no complaints about the food at all
my wife ordered mango_lassi which she thoroughly_enjoyed
we have been to other indian_restaurants in the southeast valley and we definitely rate as one of our favorites
amazing food
beautiful decor
a bit expensive
otherwise a star place
its not the most authentic food but it was good nevertheless
i think i heard too much hype
it just wasn't good
very bland biryani with little or no meat
subpar service
and slow food delivery
i prefer priya
though the service is not good either
their dishes are delicious
by_far_the_best_indian food i've had since_moving to arizona
the chicken_tikka_masala and vegetable_korma are my go to favorites every time
the only negative about the dhaba is that it can be somewhat slow in the service department
it actually adds a bit to the mellow feel of the atmosphere there
but if you're in a rush
it's probably not a good choice
the food is always worth_the_wait
since i haven't eaten a lot of indian food i opted for the maharaja patiala tandoori thali which included tandoori_chicken
tandoori tikka
lamb_curry
lentils
biryani
rice
house salad
raita
chutney
papad
chai and dessert
the lamb was the highlight of the meal
the sauce it was in was delicious
for me it was the right amount of spice without being too hot
the naan was also full of flavor either alone or dipped in the remaining lamb sauce or raita
unfortunately the chicken was too dry so i didn't eat much of it
the rest of the included food was good but not exceptional
i would go here again but next time i will stick to lamb and naan
the food is great but its a little pricey for a poor college student like me
the food is really awesome though so i suppose it's worth it
it's also a great place for a nice little romantic date
out of all the indian_restaurants i've been to in the valley this one has the nicest atmosphere
i especially like to browse the little indian market next_door when i've finished_eating
we went here for the first time because of the groupon offer
i cannot believe that in the four years i've worked at nearby asu that i haven't been here before
the space and service is warm and inviting
but it's the food that will have us coming_back
fresh
delicious
you can tell that they toast and grind their own spices
my daughter always orders chicken pakora
which i usually find very blah
but at dhaba it was fabulous moist
tender white_meat fried perfectly in a light crispy batter with just_the_right_amount_of spice
and the paneer_pakora was even better
from the appetizers
try the bhatura chole
onward
our meal was the best we've had in any indian restaurant in the se valley so far
oh
and it's a plus that they have white wines by the glass that compliment the food
this place used to be chaat corner its recieved some massive plastic surgery
nice ambiance
not any way like an authentic indian dhaba
but the food inside makes_up_for_it
the lamb_curry was thick
spicy
and rich in potatoes
it made my stomach happy
stay_away_from the goat_curry
that curry singlehandedly took away a star
it was flavorful enough
but it was thin and the quality of the meat was questionable
the thalis won't disappoint they're reminescent of thalis from north_indian dhabas
the desserts are authentic
and they usually bring you out free fresh hot tea
we went in a big group and our waiter was pretty darn good
food was very tasty and portions were great if you were hungry
the menu was extremely long and involved
accommodated our group_of_people wonderfully
restaurant is fairly small
staff were attentive and polite
i would go again
the place used to be good
but not any more
they have settled for mediocre taste customer_service like any_other_indian_restaurant in the valley
don't expect a miracle
but if you are hungry and want to grab some spice after a sun devils game
then not a bad choice
better than other indian shops in that area
the a curry a day lunch combos was paltry and plain bland
dal was flavorless and the rice was tough
so i effectively paid for a few mouthfuls of chicken curry
which was decent
and two pieces of naan
i'd rather go to a place like little india where they charge half as much without the fancy decor
the paneer entree dishes though are just fabulous
if two people are going i'd say forget about variety and just order paneer
after searching for decent indian food in the phoenix area i was introduced to the dhaba a few years_ago and it restored my faith that good indian_cuisine could actually be prepared in the valley
i stick to the vegetarian_dishes and have yet to be disappointed
the staff is always friendly
the restaurant clean and the music fun
once in a while there will be videos playing on the flat screen above the bar
but normally just some good music
i will update this review after eating there this weekend
i went here last_night to use my new living_social deal
the decor is really great down to an awesome place setting
copper cup and copper silverware
i called ahead and made a resey for a tuesday night and when we arrived there was a reserved sign on the front table
really nice_touch we got the best table in the house
the food was really good
we ordered the vegdy appetizer platter
veggy meatball dish
skip this
garlic_nan
and butter_chicken
everything was delicious and not at all spicy
i think the usual indian_buffets make things really spicy so you eat less
here i couldn't eat anymore b c i was stuffed
i would be remiss if i didn't give a special kudo to the man who brought out our food and filled our drinks
best guy ever
we started eating here last year we were very impressed with the service the food
since then
i feel like the service is somewhat lack luster
refusing to allow coupons to be used on the take out orders and insisting they have a credit_card number when you phone something in
we used to be able to order special requests
but not now
the flavors of the food are good
but the portion_size in relation to the price is small
the chicken is usually over done not the best cuts of meat
but because the sauces are so vibrant
it's easy to hide from some
rice naan are separate
which is disappointing
the atmosphere is nice not tacky like many other indian_restaurants
very good food
some of the best and most authentic i have ever had
my_only_complaint is the service
it is always slow and server never is really busy
the place is small and i have never seen more than tables full inside
however
it takes forever to order
get a refill
or get the check
hire a better server and this place might get a star from me
i have been here to eat several times
and the service is bad every time
i keep coming because the food is so delic
let me start by saying i think dhaba is actually a
star
the food was good
but not fantastic
the service was good but not superb
the pricing was reasonable
but not a steal
overall a pleasant experience
but not likely one i will repeat on my own accord
in dhaba's defense
they have a lot of competition when it comes to small indian food places in the valley
so i can't give it a compared to some of the excellence i've experienced at its competitors
my bf and i both tried the sampler platters
meat and vegetarian
the salad we started_off_with was excellent
the dressing was fantastic and they had these crunchy balls on top
almost like a cereal
the entrees were just okay
my masala was very good
but everything else i could have done without
also there was no spice whatsoever in any of the dishes
very disappointing
the pricing was reasonable
i was surprised some of the reviews mentioned it was expensive
i think dhaba is probably a great place to start if you don't typically eat ethnic foods with a lot of flavor or spice
we both left feeling satisfied
but like the meal was missing something
a precious
authentic
little wonder
went with my family from out of town and was worried my dad would be disappointed with the relatively conservative portion_sizes
however when you treat your taste_buds with something so exquisite
you don't want to overwhelm them with massive platters of ambrosia
and even though when they delivered the small bowls of tear jerkingly delectable curry we wondered if we would need to order more we actually had enough to take home
plus
when filling up the takeout boxes
we found ourselves shamelessly scraping the bottom of each and every quaint little bowl
why only stars
i haven't tried everything and look_forward to updating this with another happy stomach and an additional star
prices may be seen as somewhat steep for the quantity of food
but again i say
quality my friends
quality
saturday_night
no reservations
place was busy
but they sat us immediatly
we frequent several indian restarant in the valley and have traveled in india fairly extensivly
the food was beautiful
nicely prepared
absolutely delish
first rate
service was outstanding
there is a little grocery_store next_door and we stocked up on some of our favorite foods while there
they had some of the indian pastries that i love but rarely can find
the owner of the grocery_store and the restarant was manning the cash_register
he was extremly kind and helpful
go there
you_won't_be_disappointed
the dhaba is a little far from us
but since we were in tempe we stopped in and were glad_we_did
i loved the saag_paneer it had just_the_right_amount_of kick and the cheese was spongy and not hard
the naan was good
as was the rice
and my husband liked his lamb_vindaloo
the chai was also very good
and made even better by the free refills
we didn't have any problems with service at all
to the contrary
even though there were only two staff members there
everyone was polite and attentive
why just three stars
you ask
i knocked it two points for the portion_size relative to the price
i'm willing to pay more for quality food
sure
but it'd be nice if there was at least more of it
the food was very good
but i think other indian_restaurants have comparable quality food for more reasonable_prices
the store next_door is a lot of fun to browse
and if you're out to get fed for cheap
try their web site or restaurant
com before you go both usually have coupons
this place is consistently good
the lamb_korma is excellent
creamy with pine nuts you can actually taste and the lamb is not fatty
tandoori dishes always smell amazing
i keep meaning to try them
but get distracted by the curries because they are so good
the naan is ok
i always get paratha because i like it better
the service is a little slow
but the food is worth it
also
they have street treats on the menu that always make me want to drool
but they are never available when we are there
a perfect little gem
food was amazing
service was great and did i mention the food
we started with the paneer pakore with curried chickpeas and oh my god
so good and not too filling
i ordered the spicy butter_chicken and my date ordered the curried chicken
we were both in heaven
i can't_wait_to_go_back
a guy at work told me about this place so i decided to phone in an order from my car after work i tmust say it took me times to get somebody on the line
i think they may own the store next_door and thats who was answering the phone in a heavy indian accent after my rd attempt i finally got a employ family member im guessing the daughter who spoke clear english i told her ihad not been there before and did not have a menu but between my semi knowledg te of indian food and a few sugestions from her i got some great dishes spinich dish w chicken a spicy curry lamb dish and a great vegi dish rice and naan yummmmy
the best word to sum up my experience would be
impressed
upon walking in
the decor is beautiful
i love the authentic looking place settings
and the lighting just gave an all around warm feel to this small space
and even though the restaurant is very small i didn't feel like they had the tables packed in there
so we were all sitting on top of one another or stuck listening to anyone's conversation
our server was very nice and informative
and was really helpful when selecting the perfect variety_of_dishes
when our food arrived it was amazingly flavorful and portion_size was more than enough for leftovers
which were just as delicious the next day
i had chicken_biryani here
what they served was not even close
din't look or taste like biryani
it was more like pulao sambar rice
another rice based indian dish
but they do have very delicious entrees
go for the entrees
no biryani please
i really liked the food here
i would be kidding myself if i wrote that i remembered what i ordered
but it was vegan
the menu is enormous and it took us about minutes to get through it
however
the staff never rushed us
in fact
they offered assistance in deciphering what we might best be suited for
and you know what else is great
they actually play indian music in the background
and have an indian hostess
for entrees
a mango_lassi
an app
a garlic_naan
bucks
with a coupon
bucks
had plenty of leftovers for another meal
check out the store next_door
it has those microwave indian stews that you add rice
these packets are so delicious and quick
i had bought a restaurant
com gift cert for this place so we decided to try it out friday_night
it's a small eatery in an indian
plaza
once seated i immediately noticed the pewter style dish and water cup on the table
not the norm so it was a nice
unique touch
we ordered a vegetarian style appetizer platter with fried_cheese
potato filled dumplings
and other veggie delights
it was amazing
my man ordered the vegetable dumpling stew and i ordered the kidney beans
we got an order of basmati_rice and garlic_naan to go with it
with all of this and the crispy thing you get in the beginning
i'm not sure what it's called
we were stuffed and had leftovers for lunch_the_next_day
our_water_glasses were repeatedly refilled
which is always a plus for me
the menu is huge but broken down into veggie_options
chicken
lamb
etc
i've been to other indian_restaurants where the food was equally good
but i enjoy the different touches such as the dinnerware
not to mention the attentive service
we'll_be_back
i recommend the chicken_tikka_masala
it has a small quaint atmosphere
this is your basic nice indian food spot
great butter_chicken
as i am writing this for whatever reason the punjab pimp daler mehndi is thumping in my head
tunook
tunook mmm da da da
i first want to mention the extreme politeness i get whenever i call to place a take out order
they
unlike other indian_cuisine restaurants want my business
yours too
and it shows
the menu is very broad which i love
they have full vegan entrees
although i am not close to being vegan i do love alot of vegetable dishes and dhaba has many
the vegetable
meatballs
are outstanding
i have never had a bad meal hear although some of my favorite go to foods i can find better eleswhere
so everytime i do eat here i get something new
my go to items by the way are mushroom matar
palak_paneer and a protein i
e
lamb
goat or chicken
the dishes here always are fresh
fragrant
plentiful
bright and overall spiced very nice
i prefer very hot food in temperature and they nail it
i prefer my food extremely hot in spice too which they tend to be mellow on for my taste_buds
please
sir chef
go on and hurt me with the magical indian spices
it's ok
if i order a ten it should be blazing
with all this said dhaba is unique in it's offerings
clean in presentation and overall a pretty good indian_joint
i will continue to eat there
if you are an employee of any indian restaurant in arizona here me now
you are from the continent asia
take a cue from your counterparts and give rice with dishes for free
just plain white rice
i do get irked that this cuisine charges for this plain starch
i went here last_night with a party of
the place was pretty busy for pm on a wednesday night so luckily i made a reservation and we were seated promptly
the service was very friendly_and_helpful but pretty unattentive
this was probably because there were way to many tables with way too many people and not enough waiters waitresses servers
there were only people plus the cook
s
doing everything and they were clearly overwhelmed
the other thing i didn't like was the menu
it had far too many choices
there were probably dishes on the thing
so we basically gave up and everyone ordered a different kind of dish so we could all share
we ended_up getting a chicken dish
a shrimp dish
a vegetarian dish
and some sort of meat sampler thing
we also ordered an appetizer sampler thing
some rice and some naan
everything was very good and full of unique flavors
i've never been to india and have only eaten indian food other times
but i thought the food here was very good
the only problem with it was the price
it was ridiculously priced for what you get
the actual portion_size is actually pretty good
but charging for shrimp or pieces of lamb is ridiculous
it is even more ridiculous because nothing comes with sides
everything is a la_carte
my wife got some kind of meat sampler
which came out a full minutes before the rest of our meals
and it was laughable that it was
anyway
this place pretty much robs you
luckily we had a certificate from local dines http
bit
ly dfr eq which lessened the blow a bit but i was still pissed
so
if you must go
get the certificate and you'll be glad you did
this is the best eastern indian food i have had since_moving from the dc area
i have eaten at way better indian_restaurants out here
the malai koftas were rock hard
and the biryani was nothing more than pulav
someone please tell them the difference
just not worth it
been twice to this place
the food is out_of_this_world
we went yesterday and had the goat
which was the best thing we ate the first time
the chicken with spinach
upon recommendation of the waitress
the garlic_naan and pistachio
cashew almond naan
and the chickpeas
i'm sorry for not remembering the indian names of any plates
take your pick as to which tasted best
this is delicious food
if you like indian
i don't think you can find food better than this
and if you do
let me know where to go get it
it's average indian
not bad
flavor was ok for the tikka masala and the goat_curry
naan was very disappointing more like pita_bread than naan
i would give the food stars
however
for what you get
it's pricey
so i knocked off one star
i would not be going back there because i can't justify the price for what i get in return
i enjoy indian food
but this place had the worst service
we had a table of and some people got their food in minutes
some people got their food in an_hour
what a horrible experience
the owner sent me a message and wanted to see if there was anything he can do
glad to hear from him
also
this review was from quite some time ago
i updated with stars because the owner really seems to care about this place
thanks
my first experience at the dhaba was excellent
the food is rich and flavorful
and the vindaloo packs quite a punch
the staff is friendly and took great care of us
we'll definitely be returning
i wrote a review for this last week
but just realized that i should have posted it here
rather than under
indian plaza
i have been here three times
and each time i wonder how i have lasted so long without this food
just last week i had a lunch_special
a very good deal
that came with a drink
mango lettuce salad
the best freshly baked naan_bread i've ever had
mint yogurt_sauce
rice
lentils
and my main entree of vegetarian dumplings in a creamy tomato sauce
delicious
i was completely full
but i didn't feel gross like some american restaurants leave me feeling
i still had room for some hot chai_tea made from scratch
it was perfect just as it was
without any sweetener
the first time i went our server was nice but not so attentive
this last week the service was excellent
i never had an empty glass
and our food was quick to arrive
the ambience is intimate a great place to go on a date or catch up with an old friend
this is a true tempe treasure
love_this_place
and i'm here on valentine's day with the people i love
coincidence
no
you can thank groupon and the fact that we didn't get a baby sitter
and
did i mention
my wife also loves this place
what about grandma you ask
does she love_this_place
who knows
she's coming anyway
the menu now indicates such things as gluten_free
vegetarian
and vegan for each item
that's good because i avoid those categories like cooked carrots and water chestnuts
orders are served on an arrangement of copper bowls
the chicken_vindaloo is actually a little spicy
seating is limited
so a reservation is recommended
i'll see you at the dhaba
i just feel cool saying the name
to myself as i finish typing this review
i feel badly about giving this small family_run
i would guess
business only stars considering the service was excellent and the food was cooked_to_perfection
but i just don't like this non fat style of indian cooking which seems to be popular in phoenix
give me the butter and creams they usually cook with and i'm much happier
that said
this place looks kinda dumpy from the outside
but inside it is pleasantly
well
pleasant
clean and cute and homey
if you are a spicy indian food fan
which i am not cause i don't like it when my lips burn
this place is for you
they did serve a mango rice_pudding that was so beautifully presented i almost felt guilty eating it
almost
course
that didn't stop me from slurping it down to the bottom of the dish
yeah
it was good
reasonable_prices for sure
great service
good food
it was just not my style is all
my brother and i decided to get some take out and thought this would be a great place to try
we shared curry chicken
the lakhnavi shahi_paneer
an order of rice and order of garlic_naan
everything was very fresh and tasty
however
the lakhnavi shahi_paneer really stood_out
it was probably the best indian dish i've ever tasted
i'm already itching to go back and try more dishes on the menu
also love that they stay open til
the dhaba was a real treat
i went on a weekday evening about
pm and was surprised how busy it was
first good sign
the two of us were immediately seated and served chilled water in the most interesting copper goblets
a selction of chutney and papadum came right away as well
the hostess was also our server
she took our beverage order while we began a strategy of what to order
the menu was very extensive and contained many items i had never heard of before
despite the wide array of choices we stayed pretty basic
choosing a paneer masala
chicken_tikka
a savory chick_pea dish and of course basmati_rice and naan
the meal came quickly and was the freshest i think i have ever had
every bite was phenomenal
from the service to the dishes and everything in between made this experience truly memorable
i cannot wait_to_go_back
the only thing i would change now i am being hyper critical
would be the lighting
it was very bright for an evening meal
i guess it made me appreciate the appearance of the food easier
i loved this place
cute decor
nice staff great food
will be back for sure
first time using dining local and it was a win
the food is excellent
but grossly overpriced for what you get if you don't go for one of the weekday lunch_specials
friendly service
interesting decor
plus it's fun to check out the other shops the dhaba shares its building with
best indian food in the valley as far as i'm concerned
the service has always been beyond terrific and the food is awesome
i really can't say anything bad about the dhaba
well
once the rice was overcooked
but it was just once
it's also a great place for families
they always treat our daughter like a grandkid when we're there
last_night was my first time at the dhaba and i will_definitely_be_back
we had a reservation for at
on a wednesday night and were not seated until after pm
this is my_only_complaint about the restaurant after eating there
it was definitely worth_the_wait
we ordered tandoori_chicken
chicken_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
and rice and naan
of course
the portions look small
and we did not take home any leftovers
but we were full to the point of bursting when we left
we also had a bottle_of_wine
and i intended to try the chai masala but i will have to save it for next time
the meal itself was by_far_the_best_indian food i have ever had
i tend to gravitate more towards masalas and vindaloos for the most part
and theirs were excellent
but i was absolutely blown_away by the korma
nutty
creamy
sweet
spicy perfect
i scraped the bowl and my plate clean with naan
and will go back for this dish alone over and over and over again
the service was friendly
helpful while ordering
and unobtrusive throughout the rest of the meal
which i like
my water stayed full and that was all i needed
having to wait after making a reservation was initially somewhat off putting
but this minor annoyance was forgiven the moment we tried the food
maybe next time we will make a reservation slightly earlier than we want to eat
i am pretty new to indian_cuisine
i have only had it a few times at parties
or events at work
i have liked most of what i have tried
a few months_ago groupon offered a deal for the dhaba
and based_on a recommendation from a friend i decided to take advantage of the offer
guess what
i totally forgot until a day or two before the offer ran out
so
i quickly got a group together and made reservations for thursday night which was the final night of the offer
when we arrived it was apparent that i was not the only doofus that waited until the last_night
the restaurant was packed
and people were outside waiting
the hostess was actually turning people without reservation away
i was so glad that i had made a reservation
because we were seated within minutes of arriving
the downside was that we waited over minutes for a server to come to our table
my group decided to order three appetizers and three main_dishes
appetizers
paneer_pakora
punjabi murgh
chicken
pakora
punjabi vegetable platter featuring veggie and paneer_pakora
the winner
the punjabi vegetable platter
we laughed saying they tasted like bloomin' onions only different
the chicken was also very good
but the paneer_pakora was a bit bland
main entrees
dhaba chicken_korma
dhaba lamb_curry
achari lamb
the winner
dhaba chicken_korma
it was so creamy and had a rich nutty flavor
i felt bad
i really didn't want to share
both of the lamb dishes were good
but i found them to be excessively salty
the achari lamb was way to spicy for my taste
the service was ok given that they were understaffed and extremely busy
but i will let this slide since i waited until the last_night to use the groupon deal
i will tell you
i am a dhaba fan
and i will_definitely_go_back
bought the deal chicken for our trip to az from so cal
the food had plenty of flavor and was delicious
ordered a chicken
lamb
fish and rice dish and wasn't disappointed
the spice_level of had plenty of kick
the service was very good
i would_definitely_come_back to the dhaba when visiting az again
updating with an extra star because we went back today with a reservation at and were sat immediately
the food was heaven and the korma was maybe even better than last time
dhaba is amazing
the chicken_tikka is delish
i've gone times with an indian friend who also says it's some of the best she's had in the valley
the place is charming and food is great
they offer a lot of deals on different sites
restaurant
com groupon like sites
so look for them
yum_yum
this is an update to a star_review i gave a looooong time ago
i know i said i wouldn't come back
but i lied
you just have to realize that sometimes mommy lies
i had two complaints last time
one was that the food was not spicy when we asked for spicy
and two was that the entrees we ordered were too creamy
both of these were completely different when we went this time around
paneer_tikka_masala was right on
we ordered it at a heat_level of out of
and it was just_the_right_amount_of heat
the pakoras are great
and the mango_lassi still kicks arse
i would like to mention that the last time i was there and gave the star_review
someone from the restaurant contacted me and invited me to try it again as a guest of the restaurant
i did not take him up on it
but that was true class and excellent service
the servers this afternoon were both attentive and friendly
i take this as a sign that they are truly interested in being a great restaurant
a combination of the atmosphere
much more open
clean
and full of natural light than other indian food places
and improvement to the food since the last time i visited makes this place one of my top three indian food places in the valley
word
the dhaba is definitely one of the best indian food restaurants_in_the_valley by far
the other one we like is the dheli palace for their_lunch_buffet
we usually try a lunch buffet first before deciding whether to invest in dinner cause indian_cuisine is very pricey
due to all the rave reviews we decided to go for it and have become fans ever since
we are always surprised when the place is not so busy because the food is excellent
i think the fact that they do not have a buffet has something to do with this
for most who are not familiar with the cuisine of india
ordering can be a daunting task which is why buffets really work with indian food
i am of indian decent
st generation
so i know my way around the dishes and have been able to guide both friends and family through the rich assortment of indian dishes
but if you don't have a guide it can be a little scary
just saying
a buffet might be the way to go to give business a boost
we love the dhaba
give it a shot you_will_not_be_disappointed
the food is great but its a little pricey for a poor college student like me
the food is really awesome though so i suppose it's worth it
it's also a great place for a nice little romantic date
out of all the indian_restaurants i've been to in the valley this one has the nicest atmosphere
i especially like to browse the little indian market next_door when i've finished_eating
let me first thank yelp deals for brining this into my life
let me then thank the abundance of yelp employees i know who brought yelp deals into my life and thus brought the dhaba into my life
the dhaba
just like every item on your menu
i have no_idea_what you mean
i can only assume it translates into
super delicious
super freaken delicious
slice of god
or purely
pure exctacy
i don't eat indian food that often
i'm not sure why
but maybe its because i'm a moron
after dining at the dhaba
i not only want to make indian food a part of my life
i think i now want to marry an indian woman
who will cook indian food for me for the rest of my days on this plante
i will take care of everything else in our lives as long as you make me the standard seven meals a day
i can't think of anything bad to say about this place
top of the line food
great service
great decor
and did i mention how much i like the food
i guess the one downfall is that it is in tempe
which means you have a greater chance of running into asu types
besides the repulsion of dining with asu things
this is a tasty restaurant that i recommend to anyone who is not stunted with the stupid genes
before today i had only one experience with indian food
it came in the form of an eating challenge in new york city
it was fun but not very tasty and left me with a flaming mouth and weak bowels
a friend wanted to try and indian place in her neck of the woods
i checked yelp and saw that the reviews for this place were bad so i mentioned the dhaba
the reviews were good
i always wanted to try it and it's right across_the_street from my place
very happy we dropped by
the restaurant was on the small side but had enough tables to accommodate anyone that dropped by
the decor was nice and i especially liked the metal water glasses
very cool
i ordered garlic_naan and a lamb_curry dish
the naan was fantastic and the lamb was great
the naan provided a great way to scoop up the excess curry
for my beverage i selected a tasty indian beer
my friend ordered a veggie sandwich stuffed with potatoes that she really enjoyed
she also ordered little bits of chicken tenders
these were fantastic
the breading was good and the chicken had a little kick
if you check in you will get a free desert
however i was not offered a choice
it was mandatory rice_pudding
it's not what i wanted but since it was free i made no complaint
i could take or leave the rice_pudding
service_was_prompt and attentive
be prepared to spend some money
the dhaba isn't cheap
our bill came in just under
it's not the type of place i can afford to eat at on a regular_basis but it's fantastic for a special occasion
if you're a fan_of_indian_food or looking for something new
i don't think the dhaba will disappoint
love_this_place
vegetarian offerings are fantastic and plentiful
the restaurant is honestly a tad small but this has never been too much of a problem in the few times that i've visited
best lamb_chops ever
briyani was awful
curry mixed with rice and was very spicy
but why care about briyani when other dishes are very nice
i think maybe the bf and i are cursed
i believe that this restaurant is awesome
but we just came at the wrong day and time
we went here tonight with a deal chicken deal that was like for worth of food that included
four beers glasses of wine
two apps
two mains
two sides
two desserts
and two chai teas
well
the place was overrun by a table of about
so the service was slow and they ran out of chai
only having enough to give us like half of one glass
also
they only brought us each one drink
so i felt_like that was kind of lame
especially considering we had to pay tax and tip on ' ' worth of food
when we really got maybe worth of food
pretty lame
other than that
the place was good
we got the fried paneer
which i actually wasn't a huge_fan_of
kind of bland
but then i've never had paneer
so that may just be what it tastes like
the app with the fluffy bread and chickpea_curry was really good
the bread was almost like a savory donut or something
yum
for mains we got chicken_tikka_masala and lamb_korma
i usually love the ctm
but i think the pieces of chicken were too big
which made them kind of dry and not as flavorful as it could be
the lamb_korma
however
was wonderful
the meat was super tender and the curry was great
they also had good basmati_rice and garlic_naan
for dessert i got their 'ice cream' which is more ice y than creamy
almost like frozen rice or something
but it was very good
the bf got the rice_pudding and enjoyed it
we also enjoyed the chai
what we got of it anyway
so i would probably return and eat way less food
but maybe i'll be more picky when it comes to using deals at this place
as it didn't really turn out to be a deal at all
the dhaba is the indian restaurant that i frequent almost monthly
yes
i order the same two dishes all the time because they're very good
chicken_tikka_masala and butter_chicken
they're soo good
unfortunately
here they pretty much taste the same
it's not the best indian food i've_ever_eaten
but it sure is one of the better indian_restaurants in the valley
i've also tried the spinach chicken saag
was pretty disappointed
came out very bland and no spice at all
maybe it was an off night for this
consistency is very important to me in a restaurant and usually this place delivers
stars for creating tasty food and great naan overall
but lacking that extra deliciousness for a perfect score
service is good
you will have multiple servers throughout your dining_experience
this is often a good thing
the downside
there's usually a long wait on the weekends
very long wait
if you're on the fence about trying it
i'd say just go for it
you'll most likely enjoy it
at least i keep_coming_back for more
wow
my wife and i have been going all around scottsdale tempe sampling different indian food
and the dhaba is our new favorite
the onion pakora were seasoned and spiced perfectly
lamb kofta was great
the meat was super tender
we ordered
medium
spice_level
but it seemed pretty mild to us
spice_level is all relative of course
just sayin'
it's a pretty small place
we didn't have reservations
saturday_night at pm ish
and waited about minutes
not bad at all
but it was just of us
so if you have larger party be sure and call ahead
food service was quick
i enjoyed my trip to the dhaba
i have never eaten indian food before so my wife wanted me to try it
because she loves it so much
we ordered a veggie platter
which was amazing
the fried onion treats were exceptional
the chicken_tikka_masala was also very good
unfortunately the lamb boti kabab was very disappointing
it was so dry and tasteless
no joke it was like boot leather
i even asked the waitress if it was supposed_to_be that dry and she said
everything here is well done
but quite honestly that was a disgrace
lamb should be moist and delicious this was like steak that you get at denny's at
am
as a side note there gulab_jamun was breath taking
i'm not a desert guy but i would suggest this to anyone try
the dhaba is on http
www
restaurant
com so you can get a great discount and i would give the green light to try it just don't order the lamb
this place was tried on a whim which had to do with all the rave reviews
while i enjoyed the food
it is far from the best indian_cuisine i've had in the valley
my husband had never really had indian
so i was excited to expose him to my favorite dishes
the veggie platter was delicious
as was the chicken_tikka_masala
my_only_complaint was the lack of chicken in the dish
we ordered the lamb boti kabab and i was disappointed
the juicy tender lamb i was expecting ended_up being dry and leathery
the waitress offered no apology except to tell us that
everything is cooked well done
this was beyond well done
the highlight of the evening was their gulab_jamun
so light and delicate and perfectly_cooked
would i go back
perhaps
but i think i'll keep hunting for better indian_restaurants in the east valley
the food is really great
a couple of us went in there a week or so ago to try it out
neither of us are too familiar_with_indian_food and we were a little concerned
but it was amazing
everything we had was delicious
the restaurant was very clean and the service was excellent
we weren't a fan of the desserts
but everything else was very good
the portions are large
so we had plenty to take home
we_will_definitely_be_back soon to try some other items
i'm quite impressed with the dhaba
it's a little small restaurant surrounded in what is called the india plaza in tempe
truthfully
i can't pronounced what we ordered
but it was damn good
my friend ordered some marsala that was pretty awesome which i can at least say marsala haha
overall the food was a excellent
service was okay and quick
however the cc issue kinda got to me when they couldn't charge yes different cc correctly
ambience was probably my favorite
the decors where pretty authentic i gathered and felt_like i was transformed to a time where all storys start with
long ago
metal plates and water cups
what shall we sacrifice next har har
the food is way too spicy and the numbering system for spiciness levels is definitely off
we ordered a and a spiciness level
the difference between the two were more like a and a
even for a spice loving indian
this indian food place was way off
the naan is superb
don't bother ordering the tandoori roti
quite a disappointment
also the shrimp were spectacular
too spicy
but still very good
keep in mind that you might need reservations if you go on weekends or holidays
just call ahead
the ambiance inside is quite nice and a job well done
i chose this place and took other people with me
and wow was i embarassed about picking this place
none of us were happy
in fact we were all pretty unhappy
the business owner manager wasn't the best with customer_service nor communication
the appetizer was okay but then all of the entrees were
well
gross
we hardly touched our food
the owner seemed irked when she saw our plates full and made things very uncomfortable
if you want delicious indian in a pleasant environment
this is not it
i have eaten indian food at several restaurants and i truly believe this is the best i've had
it is very flavorful
authentice cuisine
everytime i have had indian food somewhere_else after eating here
i have been disappointmed
although it takes a while to place an order and receive your food
it is clearly family_owned and operated so i don't even mind
the dhaba is my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in the valley
the only reason i'm not giving it stars is because the service can be a bit slow at times
i love the decor and the ambiance
it's a small restaurant but it's beautifully decorated
it's much nicer in the inside than it looks on the outside
i read quite a few people complain_about the prices
i've always thought their prices were a tad bit high
until this last visit
when i noticed on the dinner menu
full meal experience
choices
i got the vegetarian version for
it came with a salad
delicious
a generous helping of naan
their naan is incredible
daal
lentil stew
rice
yogurt
and the main_course
which was a garbanzo bean dish
the final course was rice_pudding and chai_tea
i was full and happy for
my boyfriend got the lamb and chicken option
which was
but still a good deal for the amount of food he got
we both thoroughly_enjoyed the
full meal experience
and would order them again
they also have a new rewards card for repeat customers
which is great
we
husband and i
love the dhaba
our first two visits were pretty different from each other
so we waited until our third visit to formulate a solid opinion on the place
it's a very thorough four stars for us
the food is five_star good
it's that simple
we love the crisp
cumin laced poppadums
spelled many ways once translated to english
pappadams
papadums
etc
they serve while you wait for your order and the choice of three sauces
husband dips with the chili sauce
i mix the sweet tamarind_sauce and the chili sauce
their chicken_tikka_masala contains very tender chicken
and consistently has a nice spice blend
level of cilantro
and velvety texture
we find it sometimes has a little less chicken in it than the chicken_makhani
makhani murgh
and husband isn't a sauce guy
but he orders it every time anyway
the murgh makhani
often translated as butter_chicken
is tied for the best i've ever had
the sauce is a rich
as the name would suggest
blend of butter
pureed tomato
and cream
and it is studded with plump golden sultanas
not raisins
guys these are not hard
chewy blobs
and cashews
the chicken has its trademark bright red skin and is so
so
so tender
seriously
so tender
their mango_lassis are the best i've ever had
and i've had indian all over the place nyc
london
they are thick
fruity
and perfectly sweet
which means not overly sweet
not under sweetened
the garlic_naan is superb
we always order two
they use real minced garlic and it is always a nice balance of crisp and tender
no gummy naan at the dhaba
great gulab_jamun
but like most indian places
they cost quite a bit
the service is where i quibble the staff are super_nice
and super personable
the kitchen just seems to be slow
our first visit
we waited a longish time
but not so much that we noticed anything out of the ordinary
on our second visit
we waited a full fifty minutes from the time we ordered to the time we received any food naan included
it all came out together fifty minutes after we ordered it
eek
there were only a few other patrons in the restaurant at the time
too
the food was still blow our minds good
so we decided_to_give them one more chance
and we're glad_we_did
because the wait was very reasonable our third time
and the staff especially attentive
and they brought the naan out for us to graze on while we waited perfect
in short eat at the dhaba
the food is outstanding
the wait time is tolerable
and the staff are kind
we absolutely loved the dhaba
from the moment we walked in
we knew we were in for a treat
it's a quaint little restaurant in the indian plaza
and the place settings were what really caught my attention
now here's a little breakdown of my rating
service
extremely friendly
family oriented and always knew when to come to the table
drinks were refilled accordingly
and the owner is so darn nice
she gave great suggestions and even brought out a surprise dessert for my fiance's birthday
food
we ordered
udta panchi chicken_wings marinated in dhaba spices and baked in a clay_oven
absolutely_delicious and extremely moist
garlic and khasta keema naan
minced lamb stuffed naan
the textures were wonderful
lightly crispy on the outside and delectably soft and chewy on the inside
the chutneys were delicious as well
chicken_tikka_masala of course a signature dish of most indian_restaurants
it was flavorful and had great body
smothered this on rice and scooped it up with the naans
and you've got yourself one killer meal
sikandri jhinga saag
shrimp and spinach with herbs and spices almost like an indian creamed spinach just no cream
light and flavorful and accompanied the other dishes quite well
great with the naan and a little bit of chutney
the only reason i wouldn't rate this restaurant stars is because i would actually like to experience the consistency of their service and food quality
there are many fantastic indian_restaurants i've been to
and although i loved dhaba it still comes in a close second to another indian restaurant that i enjoy going to out here in vegas
but i'll tell you what dhaba was unforgettable
my fiance and i still talk about our meal
so maybe they do deserve that extra star
dhaba is considered an authentic punjabi cuisine
i have been to many north indian_cuisine restaurants
and i have an idea of what most of the dishes are
unfortunately with the dhaba
you would have some of the similar lingo
but the name would be so long with other adjectives or punjabi words that confused the heck out of me
we finally figured out what we wanted
and ordered from our cute waitress
we got the chana_masala
palak_paneer
and mutter_paneer
for breads we got garlic_naan and something else with a sweet taste
the food was average at best
and the portion_sizes were extremely small
i had a groupon for for
and i can see the groupon covering up the lack of quantity
the ambiance is this place is pretty well light and glowing for a nice date who wants to try ethnic cuisines
it is a decent place
but i would not come here if you really hungry
pretty scrumptious
we had so much food it was nuts
my friend had a restaurants
com_coupon so we went to town
we ordered the takki nakki
jk i dont remember_the_name
it was potato pancake with onions and other amazing things
it was so insanely good
you must get it
it's one of the most recommended things in the yelp_reviews and it's a starter so look for it
then we ordered the chicken fritters
they were basically like indian style chicken nuggets
curry and mango served with a garbanzo bean dipping sauce
pretty good
then we ordered the full experience meal
it came with chicken tandoori
indian style fried_rice
amazing
chicken or lamb_curry
a salad
a dessert
we got one of both and the rice_pudding was the way to go
and chai_tea
i loved the little crispy thing they served before our meals with sauces
so amazing
we also ordered garlic_naan which was amazing
the service was weird
there's a girl who fills up your water but she doesn't answer any questions
you have to wait for the hostess waitress
she was super sweet but it was slow
once you order
the food comes quickly and there is just so much food
if you like bland food
don't come here you boring white person
jk
kinda
be advernturous
excellent atmosphere and wonderful service
the food is the best indian pakastani food i have ever had
this was my second time going and i plan to return again
also be sire to check out their store next_door
awesome place
overrated place
great for americans
it of you want real quality indian food there is better to be had in tempe
nice_atmosphere here but it's definitely in a bad neighborhood
the bottom_line was this place could be a bit closer to stars if it were not for the super tiny portion_size
they are really trying to keep people on a diet in this place
it's no kebab or india gate in the quality dept imo
classy food
very good ambience great deals always
i've known dhaba since its inception the quality of food has always been impeccable
veg korma
malai_kofta the sampler platter are some of the favorites
one of the best restaurants in tempe a must visit for very good indian food
we had a coupon for this restaurant from restaurant
com
excellent choice for new year's day lunch
interesting assortment of menu_items
good service
mostly
some observations
there are some appetizer menu_items that are purported to be
indian street treats
we have come across these before
excellent
we tried the papdi chaat
which proved superior to others we've had
if this is what people eat on the streets of india
perhaps it's time to visit
they offer thali platters
which doesn't seem common in phoenix
wonderful to have a variety of tastes to try
medium
spice was not very hot
two different servers were taking care of our table
they kept repeating each other's actions
we asked for a box
one went to get a box
the other comes up and cheerfully asks
would you like a box
same with dessert and the check
the unisex bathroom is designed such that if you are sitting
hovering
on the toilet
you are face to face with a urinal
we will go back
especially if another restaurant
com_coupon appears
nice place
had somosa
naan
veggie_korma
saag and vindaloo
food i would give
on a scale of a
food was good but off a bit on the flavor
one of the better places i've been to in az for indian tho
i would come again
at pm on a wednesday we were the only customers
service was friendly
but slow
the servers manager were too busy chatting on the phone in the back or eating their own lunch
another group departing as we came in seemed to be waiting at the front counter for about minutes for the girl in the office to finish her phone call and close their tab
food was good
reasonably_priced for a lunch combo with more than enough food
of us ordered the lunch_special
vegetarian
chicken
which were all good
although the heat_level was off
the vegetarians asked for heat_level
offered range of
while the chicken was requested as a
both came out around a
why bother asking if you're not going to follow through
portions were good but oddly served
lunch combo includes salad
chutneys
rice
naan
entree
side
and desert
for our group of we were served bowls of rice and pieces of naan
we didn't run out
so it was ok
but seemed odd when everything else was served in individual dishes
we had to ask for the salad and chutneys which were forgotten
masala chai_tea
which to me is the barometer of quality for any restaurant
was just ok
too much fennel anise flavor
and too thick heavy being made with a lot of whole milk
i checked in on yelp
which is how i found the place
after my first choice and favorite udupi turned_out_to_be closed out of business
yelp specified it was open for lunch
and offered a for coupon
which i purchased
it wasn't until the end of the meal and attempting to pay that i was rudely told the promo wasn't valid with the lunch_special
i told her that wasn't mentioned in the terms
she made some excuse and wandered off
i decided i'd just take it up with yelp later
and put my card in the folio
unfortunately she disappeared and after about minutes of waiting i tracked her down in the office behind the hostess stand
knocking on the door and interrupting her personal phone call
at that point i was getting upset
with the service and called her out on the yelp promo
insisting that the only restrictions are that it's not valid for takeout or on fridays saturdays
she disagreed but finally said she'd honor it and wrote down the promo code and adjusted my bill
overall the food was good but service was unacceptable
portions and prices if ordering the lunch combo were reasonable but ala_carte and dinner menu pricing were excessive and the portions are probably the same judging by other reviews
i would not return given the variety of other indian options in the area
wow this place is great
but small
be prepared to wait_for_a_table especially on the weekends but the wait is worth it
service can be sporadic sometimes great
sometimes inattentive
but i can overlook the quirkiness of this place as soon as the excellent food arrives
have tried many
many land and chicken dishes each perfectly and uniquely spiced with high_quality ingredients
the rice is always perfect
and the bread selection
garlic_naan and onion kulcha are favorites
are always fresh
slightly crisp
and delicious
this little restaurant may serve up the best indian_fare i have ever eaten
it is indeed a rather small and unpretentious place in the center of indian plaza
there might be ten tables at most and reservations are a must
they actually had to turn away people while we were eating
the menu is enormous
the foods well described and the choices unique even for punjabi cuisine
the chili stuffed naan was delicious and different
the chicken_vindaloo was rich and fragrant
if a little on the tepid side of the heat scale for me but then again just about all food is unless i order it spicy
the okra was the best i have ever had and my wife's chicken_tikki was superb
the food was served quickly and the servers were friendly although a bit distracted
we drove minutes from anthem to eat here and we will return
i highly_recommend the dhaba
the tikka masala is to die for
love the food here
the staff is also super patient about explaining the menu
this is far from home but i'll still make the journey
i hav dreams about the tikka masala
first up
certainly not the best indian food in the city
having said that
not bad either if you are in the vicinity
i'm obviously picky about this cuisine as its native to me but i also know i won't get close to tasty food here
having said that
it's good if you want to try indian food
i had the chaat
not authentic but refreshing
little india in tempe has better flavor
for the main_course had the saag murgh
spinach chicken
and goat_curry
the goat was better
the dessert however was quite good
got the kheer
rice_pudding
which was very flavorful
the ambience is nice
the service a little slow but the staff quite friendly but not sure how well they know their stuff
you_won't_be_disappointed by your experience but you won't come back blown_away either
good indian food
we went to celebrate a classmate's birthday and had a really good time
i adored the tableware
it was heavy and had a
medieval
feel
the lunch_special is a really good deal
i'm not a fan of paneer and that was the day's veggie lunch_special
so i got the veggie wrap instead
it was excellent
so were the fries
more fries please
the waitresses weren't that personable and although the lunch_special includes dessert
they asked my friends if they still wanted it
huh
i didn't have a lunch_special
so i used my handy dandy yelp_check_in offer for a free dessert
so i could get some rice_pudding
i've been eating rice_pudding all my life and have had many different versions
liquidy rice_pudding
no thanks
thank god we had a terrific birthday cake
my girlfriend and i love_this_place
not only is the food beyond delicious
i think the portions are fine and the service is second to none
the woman who manages could not be nicer and the gentleman who works the shop next_door
and who i suspect is the owner
is always making sure that we had a superb dinner
we do enjoy trying different indian_restaurants_in_town
but we still count the dhaba as the standard by which all others are to be measured
i wish these folks the very best
even good restaurants come and go in this economy and i want the dhaba to be around for a long
long time
nice smaller restaurant
good service
awesome vegetable_korma
the dhaba is the best indian restaurant in phoenix
located near asu
it's in a good location
you would expect to find a lot of students there given the location but i haven't found that to be the case
but
i usually go for dinner maybe it's different at lunchtime
the ambience is very relaxed but trendy upscale compared with most indian_restaurants
the owner is extremely gracious and the service is excellent
the food is absolutely_delicious
really
the best in town
their lamb
usually a good test of the chef's skill
is perfect
juicy
flavorful
very tender
it practically melts in_your_mouth
everything i've eaten here has been excellent and i'm an adventurous diner who tries many different dishes
the prices_are_very_reasonable and they frequently send coupons if you sign up for their email list
i strongly recommend making a reservation in the evenings
especially on friday and saturday because
otherwise
you may not be able to get a table
this was our third trip to the dhaba in three months and it was excellent
as always
the service was attentive and the food was outstanding
their food is the best
and most authentic punjab
in the valley
this visit we had five adults and the entire bill was just
crazy reasonable
the paneer was excellent
the mango chicken yummy and the lamb was so mouth_watering
their garlic_naan is great
we skipped dessert tonight
but last visit had their rice_pudding
yum
after we left the restaurant we got a telephone call from them saying that
the gentlemen sitting on the end of the table dropped
and we needed to come back for our money
he'd never have known the dfference if they hadn't called us
so we were extremely impressed with this kindness and honesty
all in all a great experience once again
i love_this_place and plan to go back as soon as possible
i don't have anything negative to say about our dining_experience
sure
the outside of the restaurant looks a little cheesy
but the restaurant itself is darling
they make incredible lamb somosas and a rich and very flavorful lamb_korma
the lamb was tender and delicious
i ordered garlic_naan and my partner ordered something similar to naan
but there were cooked red onions throughout
i can't remember_the_name of it
but let_me_tell_you
it was fantastic
i personally don't think the neighborhood is that bad
and i've been in bad neighborhoods
no
i wouldn't go for a midnight stroll around there
but for lunch
it's safe
one of the reviewers said
great for americans
well tell that to the pakistani family who came in and ordered a bunch of food
our portions were big
we couldn't eat it all
as for the heat
they ask you how hot you want it
huge menu
if you're new to indian food be prepared to be confused
waiter was helpful with recommendations
chicken_tikka_masala was delicious as was the garlic_naan
the vindaloo was spicy
it comes at a spice_level
i took one bite and my head decided to go swimming
in my sweat
good thing is they keep the place extremely chilly and serve water in these metal cups that keep the water ice cold
service was also great
they kept that ice cold water refilled as i was trying to put the fire out in my mouth
i have not been to many indian_restaurants but i am very happy i tried the dhaba
they have coupons on restaurant
com btw
be sure to log in and buy one
it's a great deal
the table was set beautifully with traditional plates and glasses
i really liked that
it takes a while for the food to come out so be sure to order appetizers and place your meal order at the same time
the menu can be a bit shocking to take it all in at once
i did my homework and viewed it online before we went so i could figure_out what i wanted
the naan was so delicious
go for the garlic_naan
i have been to the dhaba three separate times now
the food is good
but certainly not the best indian deliciousness i have tasted
the wait_staff is friendly
the service was good
and the decor and cleanliness were both very good too
however
i think the dhaba is overpriced compared to the small portion_sizes
i really was expecting more for the money than what i got
also
i am a fan of spicy foods and really hate it when ethnic restaurants mild down their spiciness levels when serving to american eaters
call it a pet peeve of mine
each time i ordered here they of course asked me how spicy i wanted my meal
stars
and i told them
stars
extra
extra_spicy please
however
what ended_up on my plate was maybe about stars
very mild compared to what i like and what i was expecting
that left me very disappointed so after my third attempt
i decided that this would in fact not become a regular ethnic eating place for me
the flavors are good
but the heat is missing
the good
awesome food
or at least very good food
my mango chicken had a bit of a bite to it even though i ordered it mild
but the flavor was good
hubby loved his food
our rose lassi was good
but small for the price
the appetizers were all delicious although i don't remember any of the names
the not so good somewhat sullen service
we had trouble getting the waitress's attention several different times
she balked at splitting the check between two different parties even after we marked which dishes went onto each tab
most irritatingly
they tacked an tip onto each tab even though we only had a party of
adults
child
i didn't see anything on the menu about the predetermined tip
most places that do this only do it for parties over
or and it is almost always mentioned on the menu
this was really a major irritation after the mediocre service
tasty
pricey
parking sucks
really tasty
but kinda pricey
location could be better
service is okay
kinda slow
excellent service
nice venue
delicious food
only thumbs down was that each entree we ordered had only a few cubes of meet each
we used a groupon so not sure if that had anything to do with it
but other than that
pretty good food
always a winner with me
plan on spending more time where than you may at another restaurant
this is a good thing
i know that someone is making my food not shleping it onto a plate from the microwave
get the lamb_vindaloo
spicey
upon arriving at the dhaba for a sunday evening meal
we were greeted very quickly and kindly and told that there would be a minute wait_for_a_table
having read_the_reviews of previous patrons
i was slightly frustrated because i knew it would be a wait once we were seated to get our food also
however
after a few minutes
i decided i would be prepared to wait and enjoy a nice
slow evening and meal
and remember to make reservations for future visits
once seated
it did take some time to get the order in
but it was well worth_the_wait
the masala chai_tea was spiced to perfection
fragrant
and with some added honey
it was the perfect beverage
i had the vegetarian
meat
balls
i can't recall the indian name
which were satisfying and savory and did_not_disappoint
everything came out piping_hot and fresh
i will most definitely be a returning patron
i love_this_place a lot
but there are a few things you need to know
make a reservation
even if it's tuesday at
and you're already en route
i've had to wait_for_a_table in the room full of empty tables simply because i didn't call ahead
never pay full price
they always have a groupon
living_social
restaurant
com or other coupon available somewhere and paying full price is a little steep
get the garlic_naan
each veggie dish i've had i've loved
you can't_go_wrong
the paneer dishes are rich and delicious and make me fat and happy
would give this place a higher rating if the service wasn't so spotty
the food is great
came here for restaurant week and got a great deal
an appetizer
two curries and dessert with two chai's for
we went ahead and bought two bottles of wine just for fun too
i've been in here before and there is a very sweet server who makes recommendations and brings out the food
the weird part was that this time
we barely saw her and instead were basically ignored by all wait_staff
two other folks
we had to ask for the restaurant week menu
which they had hidden
they then proceeded to forget to bring out the chais and hustled us out of there until we reminded them that it was supposed to come with dessert
service snafu's aside
the food is really good and hard to argue with
all the great standards are here and if they pick_up a bit on the service
it got to the point that we had all the plates stacked up to make a visual cue
but they still left the plates there as we ate dessert
the restaurant would be a regular outing for me
great
i tried this because i had a gift_certificate
i ordered the gosht rogan_josh with lamb and a chicken with rice
raisins and nuts dish
gosht rogan_josh was spicy
i only ordered this because i made this dish using a mix from a box bought at lee lees but i think the boxed version was much better
i loved the garlic_naan
though
one couldn't go wrong with this
the chicken dish was aromatic and filling
it was a large portion
i'd go back to try other dishes
though
parking is tight
we did not make the trek to the east_side with the dhaba on our minds
but as we drove past it to our intended destination
i said
look honey
that's dhaba
it gets great reviews and has been written up in phoenix magazine
the main man replied
its indian
right
we like indian
that naan_bread
mmmmmm
so we did what we went east to do and decided we had to give the dhaba a go
there was no wait even though we had no reservation
the hostess waitress manager was an absolutely gorgeous young woman who was very much into our learning experience and helped us sound out and pronounce our orders
lamb dishes for both of us
we were given water and tea in a more than timely manner and the slight wait for our hand made
fresh food was well worth it
mm got the basmati_rice and i opted
reluctantly as i steer clear of most carbs unless they are chocolate cake or cookies
for the brown_rice
both were fabulous with the moist
tender lamb
both dishes of lamb were spicy without burning and the flavor was finally noticeable
most indian food in the valley honestly lacks heat
kick
and flavor
these dishes delivered in all three
what i did not notice until it was time for the 'go' box is that the brown_rice has the most elegant
aromatic scent
i may not actually eat it
but i will go to the fridge a million times just to smell it
all in all
we were lucky to grab up a table with no reservation
the food was awesome
the service pleasantly solid
we are just sad the dhaba is way across town
everything i have ordered here or tasted from a friend's entry has been delicious
i love indian food anyway with its
sneaky spice
and delicious warm flavors
the naan here is delicious
and one order could feed four to five people
i have ordered the dal_makhani
punjabi chole
dil bahar korma
and sialkoti rajmeh
and all of these had delicious flavors and spice
you can determine the level of spice
like most indian_restaurants
the entries come with white or brown_rice
the only complaint i have is that it can take a while even after seated
both times i have gone for dine in
it was fairly crowded
but it was at least minutes before someone even came by to ask for our orders
however
due to the extensive_menu
this wasn't a problem
since there are many delicious items in which to choose
we needed that time
water refills are constant and the food comes out quite quick after ordered
i'm also excited to know they are open till pm
the lakhvavi shahi_paneer is delicious as well as the garlic_naan
i love_this_place
amazing food
good food
we ordered achari murgh and dal_makhani
very overpriced
i have been to dhaba a couple_of_times and i have never been impressed by their food
i am very particular about indian food because i am indian
i was forced to visit dhaba again because everyone in the group wanted to
they have really improved the quality of the food
i definitely recommend their paneer_tikka_masala and chilli naan
the naan is not too spicy and perfect for the curries
my_favorite_dish was the lamb_curry
it was very tasty with good herb and spice flavors
although it was more savory and less spicy than other curries that i'm used to
it came with plentiful
huge chunks of lamb
i would get this dish again and it was large enough for two
especially if you add some naan_bread to your meal
we had the plain_naan
it was very fresh
crispy
and flavorful
i definitely recommend it
the other dish we tried was the sizzling meat platter
the sausage was spiced nicely with lots of cumin
the red chicken and kabob chicken was likewise flavored nicely
again
the dishes came with a lot of quality meat
so you will get lots of great bites without any filler ingredients
to drink
i had the indian lemonade
which is not at all like fresh or artificial lemonade made in the u
s
it was a very unique drink based_on a blend_of_spices
juice
and water
it was more of a herbal drink
i liked it
the food was a bit pricey
but had excellent flavors
fortunately
the meals were quite large and could be split by two people in order to save money
you can also look for groupon or similar coupons online
although they may choose not to take them
so i recommend calling ahead or getting a legally binding contact first
the service_was_a_bit_slow
because only one person was working both the hostess table and serving
the decor is very nice and clearly designed to with a classy indian style
this style flows through the whole restaurant
from the walls to the tables to the settings
i've been here a few times
and i've been delighted each time
i try different dishes each time i go
so it's hard for me to say that i have a favorite
vindaloo of any kind is my favorite at any indian place
and this place certainly won't disappoint if you like this dish
i had kofta last_night for the first time
and i absolutely loved it
i've also tried their lamb_tikka_masala
which is awesome
i imagine that everything is good here
while the food is excellent
service is slow and the kitchen slower
we have been here many times but won't be back
had a
reservation and didn't get out until
after being seated
it took about minutes for someone to take our order
we waited over half an_hour to have the food brought to our table
restaurant needs more waitstaff and more people in the kitchen
very slow and inefficient
i got the full meal experience and loved it
i love indian_cuisine
and this is one of the best i've had in the phoenix area
the service was very good
the restaurant is not much to look at from the outside
but the inside is very high_quality
the chairs and tables are dark
solid wood and the dishes are high_quality
my husband and i decided to celebrate my birthday a little early
we had received a groupon for the dhaba as a christmas gift and decided to use it on
upon walking into to nearly empty restaurant
we were seated and told our server would be with us
once she discovered we had the groupon
she told us they didn't accept them on this day because it was a holiday
we promptly left
once in our car we checked the groupon and discovered that new year's day was not one of the days listed as a day the coupon would not be accepted
so what the heck
this is our second time at the dhaba
after receiving shoe leather lamb and being told it was always cooked that way
we almost didn't want to give it a second chance
after not being able to use a perfectly good coupon on day not listed in the fine print
we will_not_be_returning to the dhaba
we'll eat at star of india on chandler blvd
instead
the lamb there is cooked_to_perfection
great food
this place is cozy
and had water
flat_bread
and sauces ready to go at our table when we sat_down
staff was just_the_right_amount_of attentive
price was quite reasonable for the amount of food we got
favorite indian place i have gone to in phoenix
super cute cozy and comfortable
you have to make a reservation to eat here
but i actually appreciated it
when we sat_down there was water at the table
chutney and papadum to nosh on
i also wasn't overly bombarded with service
rather
they moved silently
taking plates away when needed and filling my water when low
overall the food was very good
and the portion_sizes were very generous
i hope that doesn't change
they deviated a bit from the classic recipes which i actually didn't mind
the owner seems like a sweet little lady
and it's right next_door to an indian grocer so if you're so inclined to do a little shopping after your
meal you can
lastly
tableware is very classic and cute
while the decor itself is modern and clean
i will_be_returning
this is part of india plaza
as you would expect
it is an indian restaurant
punjabi
more specifically
i had heard good things from indian folks i know
but it took me a while to come in
first
don't confuse the cafe next_door with the dhaba
it's all part of the same plaza
same owner
but the cafe has a much different menu
much simpler
the dhaba is relatively small
perhaps tables
reservations are a good idea if you want to be sure to get a table without waiting
the ambiance is simple
understated
the plates and utensils are rather unique
metal plates
with some sort of different metal rim piece
i'm assuming these are traditional
the menu is quite extensive
i didn't really know what most of the items were
there is vegetarian as well as non vegetarian
but no beef
which was not really a surprise
the samosas were very good
they were served with a chick_pea dip
or soup
that was also really good
we played it
safe
and went with vindaloo and tikka masala
and both were excellent also
my wife did have the mango lasse
and she said it was good but not as good as india_oven
the rest
however
was better
the naan_bread is not included
you have to order it
it's good
but i think it should be included as it is in most other indian_restaurants
now for the bummer
the price
the dhaba is probably more expensive than the next best indian restaurant we've found
india_oven
maybe
it was all good
but definitely pricey
despite yelp's scale being
moderate
at perhaps per_person including tip
compared to others in its category
if you use
groupon
they sometimes have one for the dhaba
and it really helps
the one i've seen you pay for of food
we went over
and the final bill
after groupon
was about what i would expect_to_pay at india_oven
is it worth it
with a groupon
yes
without
well
that's up to you
it is really good indian food
there is an awful lot of awful indian food in phoenix
maybe i'm just spoiled by having a mother that was granted her powers of cooking by brahma himself
or was it vishnu
i have no idea who dispenses that sort of thing
but i daresay i've got a pretty good idea of what stellar indian_cuisine is supposed to taste like
that said
i believe that the dhaba has some of the best indian food i've tasted outside india
an impressive feat
as the world is made up of
of countries that don't happen to be india
the food is pretty authentic
and their menu is impressively extensive
the restaurant offers up a varied selection of naan
curries
grilled meat
and dessert
so most people are going to be able to find something on the menu that they'll enjoy
that is
if they enjoy north indian_cuisine to begin with
the only reason i'm deducting a star here is because i find their service to be somewhat inconsistent
there are days where their service is stellar
and other days where i've found myself waiting for half an_hour for a refill on my water
even so
the service is passable most of the time
so i'm not particularly miffed
finally
i'd recommend making a reservation beforehand if you intend on visiting the restaurant at all
space is something of a premium inside
and the place is usually packed when i've gone
i usually make reservations right here on yelp
so the process isn't terribly difficult
overall
the dhaba is a restaurant that i've recommended indiscriminately to friends and family alike
now that i've run out of people to recommend it to
i figured yelp was probably the logical next step
bon appetit
the dhaba is perfect
i could leave it at that
but i wont
the atmosphere is nice i love their cutlery and plates and tables
my husband and i love their papdi chatt appetizer
chicken_tikka_masala is amazing and another dish with spinach an chicken
sorry
drawing a blank on the name
every time we have been there our experience has been wonderful
i will add one note
i am hoping this was just a fluke
but the last time we were in the owners were not there and the young indian girl working there had on club music so loud i could not here my husband speak
at first i thought ok they just opened maybe they'll turn it off
nope it played loudly the whole time
also the bus girl and the indian girl just disappeared we needed water and there was no one around
we waited minutes plus for someone to get us our check
we actually had to stop the girl to ask for the check because she just kept walking by
with this being said
we still love the dhaba
and will continue visiting often
however if this ever happens again we might have to consider finding another place to get our indian food
just ate here with my boyfriend and i was very impressed
we did not make reservations but it was a sunday_night and i didn't really take the reservation thing seriously
i would imagine that it might get busy on a friday or saturday_night and require reservations though
because the place is not huge
not small either
but very cosy
we both ordered the
whole meal
thalis
my boyfriend had the maharaja
all meat
and i had the combo with dal
chick_peas
and chicken curry
the biryani that came with the food was the best i have ever had
i would go there just to eat the biryani alone
the naan was top_notch too
everything was delicious
i was really surprised for arizona
the thalis also come with chai and desert
they were very accomodating when i forgot that chai is brewed with whole milk
i'm lactose intolerant
and they traded mine out for a delicious dark tea
the service was a little slow
but still great
the restaurant was almost full while we were there but it was never too noisy
the modern indian music was a nice_touch too
this place has now become my favorite indian spot
i have to express
again
that their system of placing a reservation is very needed and essential
parking is extremely limited in the area
as it's a shopping_center as well
i noticed a couple come in without a reservation
and were sort of put off by it
they do have a little seating_area if you forget
and wait time seems to be about minutes or so
that aside
let's talk about the food
i always leave very full here
with leftovers for the next day
their kormas are divine
i will recommend the vegetarian option as it comes with cashews and golden raisins
a little spicy
sweet
and tart
and savory basically a perfect meal
the girls
servers
here are efficient
without being pushy
and attend to each table flawlessly
it gets an extra star from me
today
for the decor
restaurants really underestimate the power of nice surroundings
the dhaba definitely took this into consideration when selecting the tableware
the lighting options
tables ect
oh
and p
s
get the groupon
or check in on yelp foursquare to score some amazing deals
i don't know why they keep doing this
because they're giving away food for free
but yeah
ya know
not complaining at the moment
weekday dinner
staff was friendly
food overall was ok
i've had a lot of indian food
may be for a person who's new to the cuisine may find it better
lamb_curry which came with maharaj thali was good
so was the garlic_naan
so mey be that's what i should have ordered
we went for dinner on a friday_night when visiting family in the phoenix area
it was crowded but we didn't have to wait_for_a_table
they have a very extensive_menu with a lot of vegetarian and gluten_free options
it took a while to figure_out what to get though because there were so many things to read
plus
because everything was in punjabi
we had to read the descriptions of each dish
luckily
there were papadams and chutneys to snack on
all the dishes sounded really good
we ended_up getting the tandoori khazana with a mix of chicken and lamb tandoori that was super tasty
the lamb and the shrimp were succulent and flavorful
and the chicken really captured the smoky tandoori flavor
our second dish was palak_paneer and our third was the lamb_korma
the paneer was pretty good
and the spinach quite creamy
and with just the slightest bit of heat
the lamb_korma was awesome
the curry is similar to tikka masala but way better with cashews and raisins
the lamb was first rate in flavor and tenderness of the meat
we also ordered dessert
pistachio ice_cream made on site
it was icy and delicious and melted in_your_mouth with an amazing creaminess
the pistachio flavor really shined in the dessert
we left stuffed
what a great meal
the ambiance was very nice
with beautiful colors and a warm feeling
the lighting was not too bright
but not so dark that you couldn't see the food on your plate
the servers were chatty and pleasant
but the cart they wheeled dishes out on seemed really out of place
overall
i'd come here again if i were in the area
a great experience and a delicious dinner
i love the look of the place
the food was tasty but way to spicy for me
i ordered very little spice and it was so spicy that i could barely eat any of it
gonna try it again in the future and ask for no spice and see what happens
the chicken was nice and juicy instead of dried_out like a lot of places tend to be
oh and it was a little too warm inside
but that coulda just been the day we went
mmmmmmmm
if_you_are_looking for a tantalizing taste explosion
go dine in this quaint
zen like
ethnic hidden_gem
absolutely_delicious
super extensive_menu
great vegetarian_options
go hungry share a few platters
soooooo bomb
definitely in a food coma now
yum
went here for dinner after a long conference day and was super impressed
i love their plates and drinking glasses made of pewter
they are gorgeous
however
what impressed me most was their food
obviously
the korma sauce is the best i have had hands_down
take that other indian_restaurants
it has a delicious nutty flavor and very rich
i had the lamb_korma and left the dhaba a very happy camper
a yelp_check_in gets you free dessert
score
if you're frantically looking for a restaurant for an anniversary or a hot date
then this is the perfect place to take your significant other
the dhaba is a classy
affordable
and romantic venue
this is definitely one of the top indian_restaurants in tempe and is about as_good_as_it_gets anywhere
the service is fantastic
when we arrived the host greeted us and seated us at a table while setting down a few roses
i felt extremely welcomed by the restaurant host anywhere
and from the get go i knew that this was going to be a great experience
as for the food
it was delicious
i had the chicken_tika_masala
i tend to order the plainest items at ethnic restaurants
and it was cooked_to_perfection
the waitress was very attentive and made sure that we were completely satisfied with our order
just make sure to make reservations
as this place is quick to fill up at dinner
aaaah
real indian and pakistani food
i'm a snoot
i'll admit after leaving chicago and devon avenue
i've always been disappointed by what passes for
indian
out west
but the dhaba blew me away
i took some visit family here for dinner last weekend after reading positive reviews_on_yelp
and was sooo not disappointed
first and i love this
because i'm lazy you can make your reservation on yelp
literally three clicks and i had a reservation for four at seven
sure enough
our table was ready and waiting for us and i watched several other parties of various sizes show up and wait at least fifteen minutes to be seated
so i was feeling smug before our lhassi was even on the table
service is a little patchy
we had to request water twice
and flag down a waitress for our check
but the food is so dang good i don't even care
order whatever you want off the amazing
huge menu it will be good
i promise
my relatives had never had indian before
i know
i don't get it either
so i steered them toward the traditional favorite chicken_tikka_masala
we requested it mild and i think our server translated that
correctly
to
for old white people
the relatives loved it
and i looooved my kafta
and the fact that when you say
i want it spicy
the kitchen makes it spicy
the portions are very generous
which means lots of amazing leftovers to sit in your fridge and get even more spicy depth and flavor over the next day or two
and the rice_pudding deeelish
the only thing that i wouldn't rave about was the masala chai_tea
and that's just because i like my chai blend with a little more punch
and this had quite a bit of milk in it
the ambiance is lovely and perfect for a romantic evening
a place to take your folks when they're visiting and you want to prove you're all grown up
or an upscale but not crazy expensive girls' night out
we came with a large_group and service was sloooow
the highlight for me was definitely the vegetarian appetizer plate an assortment of flavorful fried bites that were worth coming_back for
dinner course was just okay it seemed like almost everyone at the table felt that their dishes were mostly sauce with very little
stuff
in them
kind of made_us_feel like we weren't getting much for our money
also
medium
spicy was not spicy at all
very nice_atmosphere and decor
after purchasing a living_social voucher for the dhaba
we decided to try it out on a tuesday evening
to preface
the food was fantastic
i was very impressed
i highly_recommend trying one of their entrees prepared in their tandoor oven
the naan_bread
both plain and chili infused
was delicious
however
their service was below average
granted
they did have a large_party dining with them
but there seemed to be only one waitress for the entire dining_room
it took about minutes for her to even glance our way and then greet us
once greeted
she asked if we were ready to order
which of course we were not as we had many questions about the menu
i was given the wrong glass_of_wine and had to wait even longer for my beverage
again
the food was great
and i certainly plan on trying it out again
especially as it's so conveniently located
my recommendation to the dhaba is to provide the appropriate amount of staff needed to run a successful business
especially when doing a promotional deal for guests
thus increasing traffic
we shared the samosas and chicken_tikki massala
very good food
and good service
we received the rice_pudding for our complimentary dessert yelp_check_in
that was good as well
we would definitely recommend this if_you_are_looking for indian
i come here a lot
the food is excellent
if your a fan_of_indian_food this is a must try in my opinion
i am working my way through the menu but the chicken_tikka_masala will always be my favorite and dont forget a garlic_naan its delicious
the only thing keeping me from giving stars is the spotty service
depending_on the night there may only be one waitress in the dining_room and this place is usually busy so make sure you make a reservation
food is excellent
but i would strongly suggest you make a reservation
on our first attempt we were turned away at pm without a reservation
we were in the area and it was early so we stopped in on sat
evening as we passed by at pm
several open tables but all were marked reserved
they reluctantly took us and other tables that arrived shortly_after us
we waited about min
to be served
it was only annoying because those other tables had their orders taken before we had drink order taken
once we ordered food was out promptly
under min
we loved the complimentary cracker bread with sauces to start
dhaba chicken_korma tandori tikke chicken were fantastic and worth_the_wait
portions aren't huge but we still had leftovers
we'll be making a reservation and returning soon
amazing indian food
i am originally from the uk
where you can get amazing indian in virtually every city
town and village
here in the us
not so much
its hard_to_find indian food that isnt overpriced
the dhaba seem to have it all covered
great food
good service and fairly priced
we managed to get a groupon to save a little more too
the naan_bread was a highlight
very light and not doughy at all
we both had chicken dishes that were outstanding
great job all round
thanks dhaba
i saw a group on and decided_to_give it a try since i love indian food
one of the owners
i believe
was waiting on my table and she was verrrry nice and made the experience that much better
the food was the best i have had lately
and like everyone says
you have to try the garlic_naan
i couldn't believe their
domestic
beers included local breweries
i got hop shock
i did make a reservation and our table was ready for us even though we arrived minutes early
i will_definitely_be_back for more
this food is so good
everything orderd has been delicious
every chicken dish is great
i cant stop coming_back
i'm always craving dhaba
you must give it a try
with the nan_bread and yogurt for the rice and sauce
mmmmmm
vegans can't trust the menu
dishes that have butter are noted as vegan
as is a dish with
paneer
in the name
cheese
newby servers aren't much help navigating through the mistakes
a for good intentions
but f for execution
the owner is super_nice
but i've been put off by some of the other help
especially if you arrive without a reservation
the food is among the best found
and i would give an additional star if the service was stronger
and another star if the menu had less mistakes
i took the advice below me on yelp and made a reservation
we came in ten_minutes early and our table was all ready and set to go
the service was pretty good
which i was thankful for because the reviews below me scared me
however
it was
pretty early for a saturday_night so it was not busy
we ordered some garlic_naan
the lamb boti kabab
and the gosht rogan_josh
another lamb dish
the naan was tasty and warm
the lamb kabob was amazing
the pieces of lamb were huge and super tasty
the gosht rogan_josh was extremely tasty as well
however i would have preferred more meat as opposed to so much curry along with it
however this food was amazing and by_far_the_best_indian food i have had in phoenix
hands_down my favorite restaurant i've tried in the phoenix area in the year i've been here
great food
great service
reasonable_prices
especially if you groupon it
great food
will go again
we purchased a groupon for the dhaba
as avid indian food lovers
we figured we would make the drive out to the east valley and give it a shot
the restaurant is very small
so i would definitely recommend reservations
though small it had a great ambiance
and the presentation was just lovely
their varieties of chutneys were delicious and they had a great selection of indian foods that are not so common to find in restaurants
we ordered several appetizers
a couples of entrees
and a few desserts and absolutely everything was delicious
fresh
and well prepared
the wait_staff was friendly_and_attentive
and a gentlemen who seemed to be the owner checked in with us towards the end of the meal to make sure our experience was satisfactory
all and all we had a great experience
we live pretty far from tempe
so the dhaba may not be our go to indian place
but when we are on that side of the city we will definitely eat there again
the dhaba is the only place i got for indian food in the phoenix area
it's so flavorful and they'll make your meal as spicy as you'd like
i don't always know what i'm ordering
but it's always delicious
when we first moved to phoenix we made an active effort to look for a great indian restaurant
and we found it
the food was outstanding
had the chicken curry with naan_bread
the only thing that ruined it was the obnoxious brat sitting across from me which i finally had to ask him myself to be quiet because i was trying to enjoy my meal
mom was a bit pissed with an evil eye
my thoughts are
if you can't control your kid
then stay home
or at the very least
have some common courtesy and common sense to extricate your child from the scene
after getting my car's oil changed at hon man
i was feeling a bit peckish and decided to indulge in some tasty indian_cuisine since the dhaba was a hop
skip
and a jump away
i wanted an order to go
and inquired about getting a lunch_special
no buffet
but they do have some great looking daily lunch_specials
unfortunately
they will only give you the lunch deals if you eat in
so i browsed through the extensive regular menu
the prices seemed a little high compared_to_other indian_restaurants in tempe
i decided on the dhaba signature saag
spinach
dish
there is a cute little waiting area where you can wait for your food to be made
service was exceptional
especially since it was to go
the friendly hostess at the counter offered me some water while i waited
and even offered to refresh the cup with more water for my trip back home
the order came in a nice little brown shopping bag with handles
the kind you would find at higher end restaurants
when i opened up the bag
i had a really large portion of saag and basmati_rice
the saag had a nice balance of flavors and textures
i could taste fresh ginger
some creaminess
and the delicate flavor of the spinach
i had asked for it medium spicy
and it was about right not too spicy
not too mild
the basmati_rice was cooked well
had some vibrantly colored grains and was fragrant from the addition of spices such as cardamom and cumin
overall
it was a pleasant meal
and i have more than enough leftovers for a few more meals
i'd love to dine in another time to try out more dishes
and their lunch
authentic punjabi food and great service
the spice_level is a bit toned down i ordered a
highest
and got what i would call medium hot
but they got me a bowl of green chillies so it was all good
try this place for sure
btw i ordered the non_veg thali
i'm modifying the review because the last time i was here the food sucked
the service was still great and they switched out a dish for us but the overall food quality was lacking
i'm guessing only the thalis here are good as a person in our group ordered one of those and it was good
i can't_speak the dhaba's praises enough
the food is outstanding
the service is great
the ambiance is warm and welcoming
we went for dinner on sunday
making reservations on line
when we walked in
our table was ready with glasses of water filled and papadums and chutneys waiting for us
we were greeted quickly
drink_orders taken
my girlfriend loves their hot chai
they didn't hover around the table while we were deciding
as it generally takes a while to go through their extensive_menu
it's a nice
subtle reminder that they appreciate your business and want you to enjoy yourself
we ordered a spinach and chickpea_curry and a spicy lamb_curry with mangoes and capsicum
with a side of garlic_naan
all delicious
i normally get the chicken_vindaloo but decided to try something a little bit different
the naan is fantastic
i also have had the chili naan and it's an excellent compliment
if you want to keep piling the spice on
and i do
we ended the meal with gulab_jamun
perfect for two people
we never go away from the dhaba hungry
we're always satisfied
and we always recommend it to our friends
it's hands_down my favorite restaurant in the valley
very delicious
we have visited this place on multiple occasions
and it never fails the manager is awful
i have been with and without reservations
with reservations the manager refuses to seat you until the exact time even if there are lots of empty tables
she will seat people who come without reservations but if you have a reservation you will have to wait till its your time
even if your table is ready with the reserve sign
you will sit and watch your empty table till its your exact time
the food is decent this is one of the reasons we keep_coming_back
i have recommended this place to a few people but with the growing number of indian_restaurants in the metro of phoenix maybe customer_service should be something this place should work on
foot was excellent but the place is expensive
we ordered tandoori shrimp
malai_kofta and okra
all things were well prepared and authentic
ladies and gentlemen
i have found my new favorite indian food restaurant
groupon had a deal and we snatched it up as we've been in search of trying new places
we arrived about an_hour before they were closed and it was almost empty
they still asked if we made a reservation
we did
so it seems like that may be a requirement for later dining during the week
their table settings are unusual and fit perfectly with the ambiance
the tin water glasses keep your water cold throughout your meal
i searched the large menu for starters that weren't deep_fried and were vegetarian friendly
but we settled on the paneer fritters
they came with curried garbanzo beans that had the perfect amount of spice
this cheese is amazing
you guys
for my entree
i decided to go with the vegetarian thali plate
it came with a large salad
the veggies on this were great
but the iceberg lettuce was not the best choice and it had a bit too much dressing
a curried vegetable
perfection
a lentil and bean side
divine
yogurt side
perfect for cooling down the spice
large portion of colorful rice
pieces of naan
a dessert
the best rice_pudding with mango swirl
and a chai
the menu clearly states that you cannot share the thali
which i thought was hilarious because it's so huge
no
seriously
i had leftovers for more meals after this
my boyfriend ordered a taro dish which they mentioned to us was 'dry' no sauce
it tasted a lot like a potato and it wasn't my favorite i love the sauces and spices the most but he enjoyed it
our bill was for an appetizer
a large vegetarian thali dinner plate
the taro dish and of their indian beers
each
i'm a fan
only one star off because unless you order the large vegetarian plate
all the other options are a bit pricey
i can't imagine that this place does a lunch buffet but i may be wrong
best indian restaurant in the valley
it's just an over priced place with very little regard to service
we had to wait for half an_hour after which we got the table and the food took another half hour to come
my husband ordered an extra roti which came after mins of us just sitting and waiting staring at the entree
i ordered a kashmiri chicken_tikka_masala which was extremely bland
my suggestion would be check out curry corner
just a block away
for half the price and way better taste
all and all if you wish to blow your money on fraud tasteless indian food
go ahead and try it
yum
this was my first time trying indian food i am now hooked
we arrived around pm on a thursday the place was packed we were told it would be about a minute wait
we decided to stay and we got lucky were seated in about minutes
we were so happy that we waited
the food was absolutely_delicious
so much flavor
the only reason i am giving stars instead of is because once we ordered
we never saw our waitress again we had to ask the bus boy for more water he even took our dessert order
my gf loves indian food
me well not so much as it always seems to upset my stomach
guess i'm not accustomed to all the spices that are used in indian food
maybe that was tmi
moving on
having just moved to tempe i wanted to take my gf somewhere to eat and since she loves indian food i did a search on yelp
the dhaba appeared_to_be a top indian spot according to yelpers
i had seen it days before driving by it as it is hard to miss
it hardly looks like a place that would serve indian food and rather more resembles some quirky old time western place from the outside
i questioned whether it would be good based_on this alone
surprisingly the whole plaza is
indian
in some way
indian market
indian restaurant
and an indian cafe
wow
i probably would not have come here if it weren't for the exceptional reviews
once you walk into the dhaba
the restaurant is quaint and beautifully decorated
it was busy
yet the atmosphere was quiet
the hostess was attentive and the service was great
the food was wonderful
like i said
i'm not a huge_fan_of indian food
but i ordered the chicken_tikka and i loved it
the portions were big
so unless you have a large appetite you'll most likely have leftovers
the food was a little pricey
but it was worth it
i look_forward to going back again
i wanted to go and eat at the curry corner a few blocks away
but my friend who is a bit of a snob didn't want to eat at the cc
so off we go to the dhaba
it's in a nice location
next_door is a large indian market
the interiors of the dhaba is very nice with asian inspired furnishings
mostly dark wood
it's actually a very intimate place
they serve the drinks water in a very artistic metal drinking glass
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
samosa and my favorite
garlic_naan
my friend had mostly vegetarian
the serving size were more than enough for two people
the waitress was very friendly_and_attentive
it's really a must try for those visiting phoenix tempe area and so i give it stars
what an absolute gem of a place
put our name in for a table and while waiting
went next_door to check out the little shop
what a pleasant surprise to find that it had groceries
religious and decorative items
and even clothing
jewelry and books
the owner of the shop had the most amazing
gentle energy and spent time talking to my husband and i about the history of the shop
i love how he's mostly concerned with bringing an authentic indian experience to tempe with high_quality products
the shop had such great energy too
you could tell a lot of love went into it
the restaurant next_door had amazingly fresh
hot food like the kind that an auntie would make at home
the shop owner came by after our dinner to see how we liked it
this specific treatment left a lasting impression that will keep me going back for years to come
even if it's a bit of a drive
great
great place for true authenticity and beyond friendly service
i can't_wait_to_go_back
this is now my one stop shop for all things indian
i love_this_place
it is the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
my husband had tried indian food before several times and was not a fan but after purchasing a groupon he agreed to try the dhaba and absolutely loved it
it is a smaller restaurant with very cute d_cor and a relaxing atmosphere
i recommend putting in a reservation
especially if you go on the weekend
some of our favorites are the rehriwale dahi bhalle
kashmiri chicken_tikka_masala
and lamb_curry
the fresh naan and rice are amazing
the service is a little slow sometimes but the food is always stellar
the food in general was pretty decent
although the tandori_chicken was a bit on the dry side
the restaurant is quite small and doesn't have much of an ambiance
i wouldn't bring a date here
in a word
yummy
the staff is helpful and gracious
the restaurant itself delightful
we have eaten here a few times and find the food to be consistently delicious
our only observation is that the curry dishes seem to be more sauce than anything else
that said
we really enjoy this restaurant and its delicious food
after trying curry corner i went on an indian binge
the dhaba is just as delicious but the service lacked
a smile from the waiter would have made this review stars
one year update
still consistently good
love_this_place
there is always a groupon available
definitely a good deal
me and the wife always get meals out of one dinner here
must eat
i really liked the hara bhara kabab
it's tasty
the chicken_biryani i ordered came exactly like how i wanted
it was spicy and delicious
i have been here a few times and have never had a bad experience
whether there were of us or
the food is amazing
the vindaloo will make you cry
the korma is like velvet
the naan is crispy on the outside
pillowy on the inside and melts in_your_mouth
but what really makes this place special is the service
the servers treat you like family
and are happy to make recommendations
they are always happy and bend over backwards to make sure your experience is a good one
food here is delicious
vegan friendly
and service is always fantastic
if you don't know what to order
the servers are helpful and will walk you through the menu
their garlic_naan is some of the best naan i've had in the valley
their service was good and their decor was very beautiful
we used a groupon and the meal was a great deal
we would definitely return
food was delicious
i feel it's costlier than all other indian_restaurants_in_town
food was heavy and i had to take a box while returning
definitely a great place to go for indian food
pros
great food
good service
cool atmosphere
short wait times
cons
not much seating
hostess is bland and uninviting
bathroom is behind a sheet
delicious food
wide ranging menu
excellent ambiance and service
highest quality indian food in the valley
while you're there
you may also want to check out the indian store right next_door
especially for fresh indian sweets or samosa
we experienced dhaba with a groupon
we went there during an off hour so the place was relatively empty
we were humored when the staff asked if we had reservations
was that necessary
lovely atmosphere and the staff is attentive
we ordered the plate specials
mine came with naan
chicken curry
chana_masala
dahl and rice
the rice is like a fried_rice with various veggies in it
a nice change from the usual
we both ordered medium spicy and it was just right
had the food been any spicier
it would have ruined the taste
hubby had the naan
lamb_curry
dahl
tandoori_chicken and rice
it was all delicious
our meal was complete with chai and rice_pudding with a mango flavoring
there was plenty of leftovers for the next day
we would_definitely_go_back as we thought this was one of the best places for indian food
we've been here a few more times and they do pay attention to the spice_levels when we discuss with the order taker
if you make reservations
they set the table up and take you in right away
much better to eat this way
although we have ordered mild spiciness levels the last few times
i think i am going to give them a shot again next time and order the medium spiciness level
i think their food probably tastes best with spiciness at the medium level
i like their curries and vegetables better than the tandoori meats
very good indian food
this is first place i experienced indian
and i have been hooked ever since
this is my go to spot for chicken_tikka_masala
it's super flavorful and is always good
i do wish they gave more chicken in the dish
but it's a good because i usually use the remaining curry for my basmati_rice
mmmm
the service is fast
i call in my orders and i never have to wait
which is a plus
my addiction for indian curry is quite abnormal
lol
but nonetheless
i can always count on getting a great meal here
i always enjoy a sqaure deal
and today was no exception
having a shiny new restaurant com_coupon in hand
we made our way out for the dhaba
i'm not too proud to partake in a coupon here and there
let's face it
why pay when you can spend after tax and generous tip
now that's smart shopping
this place was a good decision
we really enjoyed the food
they're in a nice spot right off the light rail
they've got a cool indian
dot not feather
market and adjacent shops to check out before
or after
your meal
the adrak de panje dish
marinated lamb cooked in the tandoor for those of you who don't know
while tasty
was a bit tougher than i was expecting
they could stand to provide a sharper knife with this item
i was here with my wife and mother in law and we all really enjoyed the nawabi murg tikke
marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor
overall they serve great tasting food and india themed d_cor
the restaurant dining_area echoed on the inside
which made for an interesting experience
we could literally hear what our neighbors were talking_about
while they did have music it could have been a bit louder
felt_like we could hear every conversation from all the surrounding tables
and i expect that this could have been overcome with ambiance level music or some interior curtains
at one of the shops
we met an interesting and awesome guy behind_the_counter
my guess is that he's the owner
he told us about different spices and dietary info about different indian foods
had a fun evening learning about indian foods
happy yelping phoenix
errr tempe i guess
food was great
i got the paneer and my boyfriend got the chick_pea something or other
sorry
i could look it up
but i'm too lazy
the spice_levels here are great as well
we both got a
definitely enough to make your nose run
but not enough to make the food unbearably hot
the naan was also fresh and delicious
i'd definitely go back
portion_sizes are enormous
we had enough for us both to eat a second meal out of it
side note
it feels like you're eating in a palace with the silver cups and plates at your table
ha
love eating at this restaurant
small place but great ambiance and awesome food
this place isn't bad
the atmosphere is nice
and the staff seems friendly enough
but they are getting three stars for a couple reasons
first when we finally ordered
it took quite a while for our food to come out
also when we ordered
we ordered some drinks
normally those would come out before the food
so
yeah
when our food came out and we still didn't have drinks
i had to ask twice for them
second
i ordered the chicken_tikka masalla
one of my all time favorite indian dishes
if done right
this dish came out under seasoned
no real flavor whatsoever
plus i really like spicy food
so i ordered it as a
scale of to
unfortunately it didn't taste like they had done anything to spice it up
last
the rice_pudding was
ok
however
they apparently leave whole cardamon seeds in there
and i happen to bite full on into one thinking it was one of the nuts in the pudding
my wife had some ice_cream desert that tasted like a mango_lassie
but it was so rock solid and in a dish that just didn't work
trying to dig pieces of the ice_cream off ended with the entire puck
that's about what it looked like
flying out of the small bowl they put it in
on the plus side
the garlic_naan was fabulous
in fact we got a second order of it
anyhow
i doubt i'll come back here again
especially if i can find a much better indian place closer to chandler
mouthwatering and ethnic
this is by_far_the_best_indian restaurant i have been to in the valley
i can't even remember what i ordered when i went but
i remember everything was delicious
probably the best food i have ever eaten
i know this sounds dramatized
but
you could probably eat a napkin there and it would be the best napkin you have ever had
good food
the wait time was too long for a pick_up
their dal_makhani was good
seriously
like the good from the dhaba
it's a little pricey
they occasionally have groupons which makes it more reasonable
they're very into having reservations
it's a small restaurant and when we've gone
their tables fill up
i do recommend calling ahead
the faislabadi aam murgh is very good if you want to try something new
excellent food
naan was excellent along with chicken_tikka_masala
wow wow wow is all i can say
first of all i love the atmosphere
because he has located his restaurant in the midst of his other indian oriented stores
it has a feeling of attractive authenticity
the husband is from the punjab and the wife is from hong kong
they make a marvelous and delightful team
the food is the real star here
the papardams with delicious sauces were the starter
then we had their chick_pea dish which was so light and flavorful
everything was obviously fresh
i then had the chicken_biryani and my wife had a mixed_vegetable dish and both were exquisite
the naan_bread was delicious as well
i have nothing negative to write
we will become regulars as we have been looking for a good indian restaurant without any luck in the scottsdale area
try the shiraz red_wine from india
it goes so well with the spicy food
came here for a valentine's dinner with the hubby
small space but the food's flavor makes_up_for_it immensely
we ordered the kolkata pani puri for starters
little hollowed out puffed pastries stuffed with potatoes and chick_peas
which you pour tamarind flavored water on
although the flavors were there
they didn't work well together
for the main_course we got the dhaba chicken curry with aromatic basmati_rice and some garlic_naan
this dish was delicious
the chicken was boneless and tender
the curry was rich with spices and heat
the garlic_naan was fresh and pillowy and worked great with the curry
the serving size was perfect for two to share
and we even had enough to take home
great atmosphere
they even had a guy playing a sitar in the front of the restaurant
this restaurant is located in the india plaza
next to a indian grocery_store
parking seems really scarce though
and make sure you make a reservation
they get booked
excellent food
quick service too
the chai_tea was fantastic and the aromas made my stomach grumble with anticipation
try this little gem
you'll be very glad you did
visited this place along with family
the quality taste of food is good
can be better
we ordered vegetarian curries
the taste was good but it was not something we would crave for
garlic naans were very good hot from the tandoor
the price is similar to other indian restaurant in the town average per_person
ambience was okay as they stuffed lot of artifacts in small place where you feel you are in very small room
i may not recommend_this_place as it didn't tantalize my taste_buds
service is very good as the food arrived in min and the lady was courteous
i'm amazed i've had indian food but not like this amazing flavors i had the vegetarian dish and it makes me wanna go meatless but service was great nice ambience and we'll worth the price big up dhaba
it was a super busy night and so service was initially a little slow
but what's the rush
slow down
enjoy the experience
mango lassies great
veggie dumplings outstanding
garlic_naan very good
veggie paneer again
great
rice_pudding delicious
host gracious and kind
go here if you want fantastic veggie indian food
don't bother ordering tikka masala like everyone_else
try something new
this is my favorite indian place
make sure you are not in a rush
let the environment draw you in
smell the frangrance of spices emnating from the food ordered by others
yiu can pair your food with the wines offered
ask for help
take your time savoring the food
i came here on a date
having read good reviews and knowing friends who like it here
and i was less than impressed
first off
i made reservations
and we still had to wait
we were right on time
there were empty tables
and i was a little confused
after being sat by our wholly unenthusiastic hostess slash waitress
we waited forever to get in our drink order
we perused the huge menu for quite some time
thought about getting an appetizer
but ended_up skipping the app because we figured we would be there all night long if we did
in retrospect
a smart move
when the food came
it was pretty good
but a little bland
i'd maybe try different dishes if there's a next time
i could see people complaining that the portions are on the smaller side
but i thought they were ok
not great
but okay
minus a star for the fact that our wine never came until our food showed_up
and i had to politely remind our server
being on a date
this really was killer
would have been nice to loosen up convo with a nice glass_of_wine
and we ended_up both getting one glass instead of two
all in all
super disappointing
thought it was going to be a fun
interesting experience
and looked forward to doing something different
but this place is firmly out of my
dating restaurants
rotation
maybe i'll come back with friends
if we had a super_nice waitress who suggested dishes and treated us well
it could have been great
and
it doesn't have a very romantic ambiance
we were so far apart when sitting at our
table for
that we joked about having convo via carrier pigeon
factor in the fact that it's kind of expensive
and yeah
stars all the way
you guys
the tikka masala
the spice
perfection
amazing
weird bathroom sitch
so close to the sitting area and a urinal
bleck
but doesnt matter
food trumps any building logistics
i had an excellent experience with my friend here a couple weeks_ago
caution
the menu is huge
i don't even know what i ordered
i kept asking the waitress and then was like sure
i do know we had the appetizer sampler
again no_idea_what it was
but ooooh so yummy
my friend got chicken_tikka_masala with no heat
but it was still really good
i got a seven and by then end of the night i felt the burn
the mango_lassi were soothing and delicious
plus we got a discount from google
so we were happy
but we forgot our leftovers i was so sad
definitely recommend_this_place
a little pricey but great food
bonus point for the white guy playing the sitar in an otherwise totally indian staff
this place is delicious
i ordered way too much food
and the portions are huge
low the tikka garlic_naan cauliflower that was spicy
also loved the owners
so sweet
this was delish
and i love that they had clear marking on what was vegan on the menu
we asked for out of spicy
and it was still pretty mild for me
the cauliflower had the most kick
but not overwhelming
next time i will try or
and there will definitely be a next time
it's hard to believe that there's a special place like this in tempe
not impressed at all
i didn't like the taste of the food and i didn't think the service was good at all
i won't be going back here for sure
i also thought it was over priced for what they offered
i wouldn't recommend_this_place to my family and friends
but i know alot of people who find it to be fine
personally i just didn't like it though
i've been here a few times and always enjoy each visit
first of all
when you walk in you get an inviting feeling from the smiles and courteousness of the staff
you get to experience a bit of the culture with the lovely dining set they have and by the look of the decor
and of course
the many flavorful dishes that they offer
their staff pays attention to the water level of your cup and ensures it is filled
that's an a
this time around i tried papadum which is a starter
it looks like a tortilla but the texture is a light tortilla chip made of lentil powder
rice powder and some different spices
you can practically eat these non stop
favorites chicken tandoors bread dessert
rahon dal tarka which is yellow lentils mixed with different herbs and spices
you can eat this with their saffron cumin rice
gudaspuri mutter_paneer which is blended mix of peas and cheese along with the dhaba herbs and spices
great for trying to fulfill the veggie part of your daily food intake
palak_paneer
spinach and cheese
is also good
gazab ka kadahi murgh which is a bbq boneless chicken marinated in a spicy yogurt
this is my new favorite dish because it's baked in their clay_oven
once cooked then its marinated in the yogurt_sauce and mixed with onions
bell peppers and tomato to create a wonderful sauce
tandoori murgh
chicken
cooked in the clay_oven paired with onions and a squeeze of lemon
pani puri which is small finger foods
street_food
little chip like texture cups filled with potatoes and chick_peas
pour the mint water in the filled cups and add an optional taramind sauce or mint sauce
garlic_naan is hands_down my favorite garlic_naan i have tasted
if you're wanting garlic_naan then come here to eat it
it's soft
airy
fluffy with the right amount of crispness on the edges and amount of garlic shavings on top
ras malai
sweet condensed milk cheese circular chunks
homemade dessert
think of fresh mozzarella cheese texture
really soft clean texture mixed in with the condensed milk cream_sauce
halwa which is a carrot fudge
sweet cooked carrot shavings boiled in condensed milk mixed with hints of pistachios
cashews
and golden raisins
really innovative for a homemade dessert
overall i loved this place because i can always select new dishes as well as favorite dishes to eat and i can always expect great friendly service from their staff
gotta come check_this_place_out
mmm mmm gooddd
only thing i regret was not taking pics of the delicious foods
next time
i've eaten lots of curry throughout my life
this curry was just okay
the menu is massive and offers a lot of variety
for someone unfamiliar with the cuisine it's quite daunting
since i was trying out this restaurant for the first time i decided to try something i was very familiar with and ordered a shrimp masala
the dish was seasoned heavily
like any indian dish should be
but the flavors didn't really seem to balance out very well
all of the seasonings tasted a bit off
and were a bit overbearing in a funny tasting way
but alas
not bad by_any_means of the imagination
i cleaned off the plate and would try it again
the shrimp itself was wonderful
very fresh and well cooked
the garlic_naan was to die for
it was one of the best naans i've ever had
cooked_to_perfection
judging from other reviews
i'm not sure if we just came in on an off night or what
but the service was not good at all
we were probably sitting for minutes before someone came over and took our drink_orders
and this was not on a busy night
our server didn't seem particularly happy to be there
the food took a little while to come out
but i expect that when ordering more elaborate meals
and was not at all turned off by this
the restaurant has a little side shop
which sells british and indian goodies
which was delightful
a definite plus
best indian in all of phoenix
loved the atmosphere and the food very much
i would_definitely_come_back and i would say makes it in to my top indian_restaurants in phoenix
definitely high up there in terms of the cute atmosphere
can't_wait_to_come_back and go to the little market next_door
great food but very expensive
several nearby places offer same quality at lower price
nice place inside
food prices range from appetizers to entrees
flying horse large beer
food was
atmosphere
young couples
music play some music for god sake
overall
if they had music and some free papad to start with
i would of given them
still
buy the groupon and go during the week
outstanding flavor
spicy as a bastard
and good beer_and_wine
a bit pricey for sure
but worth it occasionally
the adjacent indian store is cool but even more overpriced
update to my post
i set the dollar value at but that was with my groupon
the value is a bit higher_than that if you have an appetizer
entrees
desert and wine as our groupin did
still excellent food
excellent
excellent
excellent
i was here for my first time last_night with some friends for dinner and we were all very satisfied
wondeful service and a great selection to choose from
i will most definitely be back
this place is a hidden_gem
we were there for restaurant week
the food was outstanding as was the service
the staff were very nice and pleasant as well as attentive
i cannot recall the names of the food we ordered but it was the best_indian_food_i_have_ever tasted
i highly_recommend this place
we will be back
don't forget to check out the market that is located to the eastern part of the dining_room
the chai was also very tasty and delicious
as an indian
five_stars was out of reach anyway
the food was decent
not bad for arizona indian food
we enjoyed the paneer makhni
lamb_vindaloo and chicken curry
the naan was also very nice
i tried some chaat
street_food in india that is typically flavorful and delicious
and it was border line inedible
we requested extra_spicy and it was bland and likely had been sitting for a while
i never understand why chaat is so difficult_to_find in phoenix and this was pretty disappointing
i would also say that it was expensive
a decent indian buffet is often a better value and larger food coma
this restaurant is the only place i go for indian food
oh my goodness
the staff is so nice and the food gives me random cravings almost everyday haha
i recommend the chicken_tikka_masala at a number or hotness level
mmmmm
it's a little place that makes a date_night very intimate or a lunch with a friend very personable
i had two friends that had never tried indian food before so i took them here and they were in shock haha
definiately a great place to go
if you are going friday or saturday_night make a reservation
there are a lot of other people who have the same opinion as me
oh and most plates are around so a little up there but definitely worth it
we went on a weekday afternoon at around pm
it was fairly empty
the food was a mazing
we had different tikka masalas with basmati_rice
perfect rendering
i tried the gluten_free
vegan roti
and it was yummy
especially with the plum sauce we got with the gulshan e bazar
which were also gluten_free
vegan
and delicious
as someone who can't eat gluten or eggs
and shouldn't eat dairy either
really
i was amazed that i could have a satisfying
allergen free meal that was super delicious
and the service was very friendly and very
very helpful
it's a huge plus that their menus are marked for gf
veg
vegan
though dairy and eggs separated would be nice
the dhaba is my go to indian good place
i love it
it is the best indian food i've had in the valley
it's very small and i recommend making a reservation in advance to be safe
on occasion they do put out a groupon that is insane
foods i recommend
chai_tea
free refills
chicken_tikka_masala
paneer_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
garlic_naan
raita
we had some friends coming over from ri who were craving for authentic indian_cuisine and so based_on the yelp_reviews we took them to the dhaba
and we were not disappointed
the ambiance is very acceptable
they've managed to recreate a mildly indian atmosphere in there
we went along with our vegetarian friends and stuck to a veggie diet
the bhel_puri wasn't that great
however the samosa chat more than made up for it
the garlic_naan as many of the other reviews point out
was simply surreal
the same could be said of the paneer_tikka_masala and the kofta
the food was really good
now
for the put offs
with just one other table occupied in the restaurant and us having given our orders in advance
it took good minutes for the food to arrive
and that too
after the other table was served
the lovely young lady who welcomed us
showed us our seats and took our orders had a terrible scowl writ all over her face
she never once did smile
was very curt and generally had the air of someone who was waiting on a bunch of people who had invaded her house
uninvited
despite the food and the ambiance and the wait time
the one thing which we all kept going back to weeks after our visit to the dhaba
was how dispirited and unwelcoming the lady was
bottom_line verdict
good food
good ambiance
not really welcoming
their butter_chicken is good
the atmosphere is really nice
incredible
that pretty much says it
the service and food were spot on
easily the best indian food
no
food
that i have ever had
i would say it is the best restaurant i have ever eaten at
including
high end
restaurants that are easily two to three times the price
officially my favorite restaurant
ever
they have a total respect for people and food
can't_wait_to_try more vegan dishes
visiting phoenix from dc
was hoping to find delicious indian food like we get in dc
dhaba definitely delivered
enjoyed all the dishes
especially the lamb_vindaloo and the palak_paneer
so glad we came
this is our st time dinning at the dhaba
we loved the ambiance and the decor of the place
the server hostess was very nice and the food was amazing
we had the garlic_naan
lamb soup
chicken mango curry
chicken and lamb_curry
the basmati_rice and garlic_naan were out if this world
the meats were all tender and tasty
we also had chai_tea and rice_pudding and they were pretty good
the only down side is that the service was a little slow but we will definitely come back
the portions are very good and filling
the place was pretty empty for a friday lunch but everything was very good so no complaints
i loved the spicy vindaloo and the pangang evened everything out
the lemonade was spicy and refreshing
just wonderful
the best_indian_food_i_have_ever had
the service is always amazing
i come here on a monthly basis and it is always consistant
when we crave traditional_indian food
we come here
tasty yet overpriced
except at lunch
also carefully look at your bill
they hide the fact that they add gratuity for themselves by making it look like part of the total amount you must pay
not an itemized suggested amount
pros
great variety with a lot of dishes
good lunch prices
tasty dishes no_matter_what you order
beautiful ambience
cons
dinner prices are higher_than most indian places
some staff can be truculent if you do or ask for anything that apparently isn't to her liking
deceitful w bills
as mentioned above
they print very archaic looking bills w only numbers so you must remember exactly what you ordered and what it cost
but read it carefully
it is itemized first by food drink
then food drink tax
then food drink tax tip
so it's easy to assume the number at the bottom is your total without tip
which leads most people to double tip them unknowingly
i've seen my coworkers miss this every time
makes me really wonder if they aren't intentionally making their bills cryptic and confusing
my husband and i had a very enjoyable lunch
the restaurant is clean and pleasantly decorated
every dish we had was delicious and the owners were lovely
thank you
i bought a groupon to the dhaba
and my fiance and i used it a_few_weeks_ago
it was really nice
i liked the decor
the place is a bit smaller than i expected
but very cute
i had the chicken_tikka_masala and it was excellent
spiced just right for me
i asked for it at a
my fiance had sag lamb
and he liked his as well
i had garlic_naan
it was a little dryer than i like
but still pretty good
we went next_door to the shop and it was pretty cool to look around
we will be back
really
i tried dhaba for the first time today
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala which was good and garlic_naan which was ok
they deliver so that's always a plus for me
i'm looking_forward to trying some other things
i went there this weekend
though the place is smaller and there is only one common washroom
ughh
we really enjoyed the food
we had tandoori_chicken
naan
kadai chicken and mango_lassi
but i must say the price is a bit high than other places
so good
had the special salad with corn cilantro tomato onion and rice crisps
the chicken curry and garlic_naan
so fire trucking good
not bad at all
the food is tasty
portions are large and prices_are_reasonable
avoid the khus shurbat drink
though it simply tastes like sprite
which is what they said they made it from
masala bay is decent indian fair
the food is great and the terrace is a good as it gets in waterloo
i love the fact that if you want spicy
you
ll get spicy
i just wish the portions were smaller and cheaper
i like to order multiple plates with my friends and share among the group
its my personal preference not to be served a heaping bowl of food and stuff my face
decent indian food in the area
parking can be a bit tricky and when it's raining
you may have some trouble walking in the entryway
that said
we thoroughly_enjoyed our meal here
chicken_tikka_masala
butter_chicken
naan
and rice filled us up just enough
the prices seemed a little high for what we got
other than that
i'd probably stop in here again if i were in the area and craving_indian_food
definitely my favourite place in waterloo
i've tried a couple of indian places nearby and keep_coming_back
many of the staples of indian comfort_food are done very well
the menu marks the spiciness of a given dish very well and i've never been surprised by either how hot or bland a dish was given the spice marking
the portions are very large and conducive to sharing with a friend of partner
i've never been to their_lunch_buffet but their prices can be a big high at dinner
regardless
i consider it a welcome premium for the quality of the food
they also do take out and it is great to take such good food home
the portions are large enough that you can probably make two meals out of it
unassuming exterior
but with well decorated indian themed interior
heavy
solid metal menus are part of the distinctive character
extensive food options
and the place has been full of patrons the two times i've been there
recommend
i love this restaurant
definitely the best indian restaurant in waterloo
the decor is very nice inside
for dinner
they dim the lights and bring out the candles so it has a very romantic feel
in the summer time
they will open up a patio which is a bit more casual if you want to go with a couple of friends
the first time i went
i went with friends and we were all dressed in very casual clothing
it was a little awkward since we were having dinner
and there were candles and everyone around us was dressed up and on a date or with their families
we didn't know
the service is good
but sometimes it seems they are understaffed and take a while to bring you something like more water
overall
the wait_staff is helpful with the menu and friendly
the food is great
the butter_chicken is very tasty and the naan is made very well
they also bring out some complimentary crispy rolls
and sauces for you to dip them in and they taste amazing
the best value is to go during lunch time
for lunch
they only have a buffet
the one time i went
they had fruit
butter_chicken
naan
a type of goat_curry
chicken tandoori
potatoes
some beans veggies dishes
dessert and ice_cream
great value
my_only_complaint is parking
masala bay is located next to a hotel
and there is a private lot but i guess the hotel claims all the parking spots there since there are signs everywhere that state parking is reserved for hotel guests only
consequently
you will have to park on the street and walk about to minutes
depending_on the time of the day
one last note there is a picture on the wall of stephen hawking at the restaurant
neat
masala bay has good indian food
the two times i've gone
i have been with a group_of_people and we have shared dishes
family_style
so
i'm not always sure what i ate
but
it was all good
some of the things that stood_out to me were
the garlic_naan and the vindaloo
it is very spicy even to this southern so watch out
as the previous reviewer pointed_out
it is a small restaurant with what can be difficult parking
the second time we parked in a free parking_lot just past the restaurant which was nice
and they can be understaffed
but
the food is good
the beer is good and the atmosphere is nice
i will certainly go back if i find myself in w town
i came here with such high expectations after having read quite a few positive_reviews
we ordered off the menu for an early dinner
the mango_lassi was quite good
the biriyani rice was dried_out and crunchy probably leftover rice from their_lunch_buffet
the chicken in the curry tasted as though it was a few days old
the lamb in the biriyani had too much fat left on it and made the whole dish taste too greasy
the d_cor inside suits the indian theme of the restaurant
this is definitely not the best place in kw for authentic_indian_food
their weekday lunch buffet is a steal not a deal
food is delicious and they offer dishes that are actually spicy
terrible to average food quality
slow service
dim ambience and expensive
probably still in business because of lack of serious competition in kw
most indian_restaurants in kw are pretty bad
communal pots of sauce are taken from table to table
drying out and picking_up germs as they go
unhealthy and unappetizing
and it is revolting to see other people's crumbs in
your
sauce
i'm not a germphobe but i found this to be a foul practice
i never saw the sauces refilled or the sauce plates taken away to be cleaned
the curries are lacking sloppily presented and tasted of stale spices
the only reason this place gets even two stars is that the samosas are still okay and the tandoori is decent
our shrimp appetizer came with the nasty table sauce and cost for four small fried shrimp
on the menu they allegedly have some special sauce
but it's just the little table sauces and nothing special
wine_list is short
and mark ups are massive
the outdoor tables should be a nice place to eat in the summer but the plastic tablecloths are tacky and dirty
our waiter was rude and awkward
he nearly threw the food on the table and interrupted our conversation
i mentioned it to the hostess
she said he usually works in the kitchen and has a condition that makes it difficult for him to work with customers
this is unfortunate
but i'm still paying pretty high prices and part of that is service
perhaps they should hire another waiter if they are lacking in staff
it's a shame
because we used to love_this_place
it used to be a cozy upscale indian treat and now it's just messy and lazy
they are very lucky that there's little in the way of competition in k w
because this place wouldn't last a week in toronto
we took out of town guests to masala bay more than once and enjoyed it
but this last experience was a total turnoff
we will_not_be_returning
i have tried both there lunch buffet and a la_carte dinner
if you arent that hungry you_will_not_be_disappointed with there a la_carte dinner even though it might be a little pricey but well worth it
if you are hungry then you should try there buffet as they have a lot of varieties of food even for vegetarians
you can notice the quality difference from the buffet to a la_carte but the buffet is still awesome
my husband and i ate at curry_leaf last_night and were very pleased
this place is family_owned
has been open about three months and is located in a strip_mall near a basha's
the place is small and sparsley decorated
but i came to eat not look at stuff on the wall
the service was very friendly and prompt
both my husband and i ordered chicken curry dishes with chapathi which is a whole_wheat flour flat_bread
the food was very tasty and flavorful
i was getting full
but could not stop_eating as i found it that good
as we finished_eating one of the owners came out and we talked with him for a while
he explained how they prepare the food and their goal is for fresh and healthy food
the wife prepares and cooks all of the food and the husband and daughter help out in front
i'm definitley a fan and intended to go back soon as the food was delicious and the owners are very friendly
total sux ass
what a disappointment
we found out that a new indian place openning up near by and wanted to go check it out
came once and they were closed
came again and they were closed
but finally today we found place open
ordered some stuff
got some boxes took them home
its really not an eat in kinda place unless you like dinky tables and walmart plastic chairs
ohh boy
ohh boy
ohh wait
rice
wtf
its just a bowl of rice with some very little
stuff
on top of it
wow are those vegetables from frozen pack
cuz it sure looks like it
tastes like it too
so
i just paid bux for small bowls of rice with some questionable chicken and some frozen veggies that tasted like fast_food indian
damn i feel violated
i highly enjoy this place and my husband and i have been back many times since our first visit
i very much enjoy the food and the owners are so friendly and really go out of their way to make sure you have a good experience
i understand everyone is entitled to their opinion
so for those that did not enjoy this place your opinion is valid
but i don't understand how you had such a horrible experience
i also don't understand why the reviews had to be so nit pickey
for the reviewer that nit picked about the tables and chairs
big_deal
shouldn't you focus on the food and not the decor
i know i go to a restaurant for food not decor
i think the same reviewer remarked that the veggies are frozen
quiet the opposite
the owners pride themselves on the freshness of their food
having spoken to the owners i think they know how to run a business and if more people give them a chance i think they will suceed and they are listening to these yelp_reviews and taking what we say about them into consideration
which is more than i can say for most restaurant owners in this town who don't seem to care a whole lot what their patrons say
i know not everyone will have the same experience
but i can say that i like this place and it's just too bad the other reviewers didn't enjoy what curry_leaf has to offer
yes
we understand
the owners are friendly
i too like the owners
they are a sweet couple
now regarding the actual place itself
skip it
it's amateur food and i mean that sincerely and not as an insult
the person preparing the food is not a chef or a professional cook by_any_means
it just sees as if some random auntie and uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast_food versions of indian food thinking
these dumb americans have no clue
we will call it chicken tikha masala wrap and they will think it's cool
i'm indian and i had a hunch this place was like that but i was bored and decided to pay them a visit and try this authentic food
after all
if the food is great
then i could care less if it's faux indian food
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
bowl
i asked them if they could add some sauce to it and the owner responded
yes
many customers have asked me to do that so we started to do that
first of all
chicken_tikka_masala without sauce is like eating chicken soup without water
it doesn't exist
and what makes this story even more odd is that when i got the chicken with the supposed added sauce
it was still dry
it had literally one teaspoon worth of sauce over some very dry and poorly cooked rice
and i paid bucks for that
needless_to_say i didn't go back
look
i'm not insulting your intelligence
i know you have eaten indian food at an actual sit_down indian restaurant and that this is supposed_to_be good in it's own manner as a pseudo fast_food version of indian
hey
fast_food indian
love the concept
i'm down with that
unfortunately
it's already being done in bigger cities and it's much better
even fast_food indian has more flavor than this place
furthermore
they are slow
you don't walk up
pay bucks and walk away with chicken_tikka wraps minutes_later
you walk up
pay bucks and wait minutes for one auntie to microwave your food in the back
it's interesting seeing some of the reviews on here
you would think curry_leaf was trying to present itself as an upscale indian food restaurant in a hugely desirable area
curry_leaf shares a strip_mall with a dry cleaners
taco bell
az hair co and chuck e cheese
it's a small place with tables to eat in
but i imagine most of their business is takeout or the newly available delivery
jeff p mentions
it just sees as if some random auntie and uncle decided to lease a space and start cooking fast_food versions of indian food
first of all
i disagree with this
and second
isn't america founded on the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses
curry_leaf is owned by a husband wife duo and i was super stoked at how nice the husband was
he answered my questions without prejudice which is rare for me in other indian establishments
while i waited for my food
we chatted about their business
my business and other random chit chat
as i was leaving
another gentleman came in and the husband sang out
hey bob
how are you doing today
it's nice to see that customer_service and appreciation are still alive these days
i ordered the channa_masala bowl with basmati_rice and a side of cumin potatoes and i was really impressed
the flavor in both dishes was great and had just a little tinge of spicyness
the portions were great and for the price of
i think an excellent value
lunch price is
regularly
there are also a couple of really neat things that make this place stand out
they offer deliver and text in service
so you can actually text them your order for pickup
i think that is such a cool idea
you are texting directly to the husbands phone
and then he saves your number so that in the future he knows that its you
i'm pretty sure he remembers every customer
the bowls that they use for takeout are very durable and can be used again as tupperware
i think this is a super cool idea and adds a little value
in a world where we are cattle prodded through life eating out of styrofoam containers in our cars
i believe curry_leaf has made an attempt to add value to their product and i for one am both impressed and inspired and look_forward to a new weekly lunch spot
with regard to amber w
's points
i'm rating the food not the containers or the owners
if it makes you feel better eating subpar food because of the american spirit so be it
others of us are more concerned with the food itself
i'm not downgrading it because it's not a sit_down restaurant
even among non sit_down restaurants or
fast_food
style indian themed eateries
this place is subpar
i've eaten at quick indian eateries and they are much better than this
my review is for people who understand and can appreciate good indian food
it's not for people who value text service
nice containers and chatty owners
i want to support mom_and_pop and locally owned restaurants but i also want to support good ones and not encourage bad ones to emerge simply because there is no competition for indian themed restaurants here
am a big indian food connoisseur
i am always on the hunt for indian food in phoenix and it is too disappointing that no restaurants so far has met my expectations
unlike seattle
where my brother lives
good quality indian food is hard to come by here in phoenix
i have read the reviews_on_yelp and none of it seem to have presented the good and the bad that can provide a feedback to the people running this business
with that in mind
i want to visit this restaurant and will be posting an opinion soon so other yelpers can get a good input
i have never had a nicer
happier or friendlier server in my life
the man was a pure delight
so its somewhat painful to do this
but dont come for the lunch buffet
bland crap bland
the highlight is the starter
which they serve you before allowing you to go to the buffet
we actually got up to hit the shit out of the buffet but were told that we had to wait til we were served the apps
all good
on the buffet the best were the condiments
the worst would have to be the food
not good
there is a much better indian lunch buffet around the corner that i will suss out and up star
suruchi is a friendly
and serious indian restaurant with some fun scottish twists on their menu
i came here on my first night in edinburgh in search of vegetarian fare two other veggie places right down the street didn't pan out for various reasons
and indian food is always a safe bet
i had an excellent kafta makahi dish
and when ordered with the spice_level
as you would have it
please i like spicy foods
i was not dissatisfied
it was perfectly spicy without being overwhelming
and the flavor was excellent all around
service was quick and pleasant
and the cook checked to see how everything was
price paid for a main_dish
drink
irn bru
and garlic nann was
if_you're_looking for great indian food at a reasonable_price
and or a wide_selection_of vegetarian_options
including veggie haggis fritters
what
then give suruchi a shot
i ate lunch here today
and i actually couldn't wait to get home and review it
whether you see that as an indication of how good this place is
or of how sad i am is up to you
but you should definitely eat there before you decide
we went for their course lunch deal for
as we just happened to be walking past and were given a flyer
we did not regret it
although i am now extremely full
i usually steer clear of indian_restaurants as i often find the food can be very greasy and stodgy
and very often it all tastes the same
none of that is true about this place
the starter is automatically brought to you
you don't get to choose it yourself
although the waiter did ask us if we were vegetarians first
he brought us thinly sliced potatoes which had been fried in a lovely combination of spices until crispy
although i'm not going to pretend for a second that i know what they were
alongside these we each got a huge chunk of tandoori grilled chicken and an equally massive chunk of chicken marinated in their own unique spice blend
with a side salad and home made raita
i'm not sure if it was the selection of mains or my boyfriend's almond and saffron lassi which was the ultimate winner
but the mains definitely played a huge part in it
there was a buffet with different curry dishes a tadka dal
a tandoori lamb_curry
a veggie sweet potato spinach curry and the best one of all
chicken cooked with cashew nut paste
roast tomatoes
garlic and green chillies
oh
yes
of course
this all came with an unlimited supply of green salad
home made mango_chutney
flavours of home made poppadums and as much home made naan_bread as you can eat
as for the lassi
you need to go and try that for yourself at
it's an absolute steal
the best thing about all this was the bill
for two of us to eat more than
in all probability
was healthy for that time of the day
a lassi
a beer and large bottle of mineral water we paid just
if you like indian food
or even think you might do but you're still not sure
i can't recommend_this_place highly enough
if you are ever in the mood for a decent indian meal
suruchi is the place to go
situated in the centre of the busy and bustling nicolson street
suruchi is just around the corner from the main university campus
george square and is a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach
the restaurant looks pretty small from the outside
but inside it stretches back quite far and is able to accommodate a lot of customers
suruchi's menu offers a wide_selection_of authentic indian_cuisine and i ordered the seafood soup to start which was truly amazing made with really fresh_ingredients and tasted super fresh yummy
i then had the butter_chicken for my main which was equally as amazing and the chicken was cooked_perfectly and there was no excess layer of oil on the sauce which i sometimes find with indian dishes
there are warnings on the menu indicating which dishes are mild and which are hot which always gets a big thumbs_up from me as you won't get your head blown off by an unexpected chili
the prices are really reasonable here with most main meal curry's costing about six pounds
and there is a lunch deal available too where a two course meal costs what a bargain
suruchi is a really great indian restaurant serving beautiful food and it is definitely worth a visit
some friends and i came across suruchi after an exam in the nearby adam house
we were all starving
tired and just fancied relaxing with a tasty meal
thankfully we found this place which offers great service and delicious
authentic_indian_food at reasonable_prices
the restaurant isn't the biggest and it has a really friendly
chilled out atmosphere with clean
neatly laid_out tables
the staff are all pleasant and they seem to take no time to get your food out the kitchen
i had the butter_chicken with boiled rice and a naan_bread which cost only about
it tasted amazing when it arrived and we all agreed that we'd come here again any day
the flyers say this restaurant offers true taste_of_india
and if thats true im going to have to put it out there and say i don't like the taste_of_india
i was really disappointed with the food here and i wasn't the only one
my korma was kind of watery and way too sweet and the other curries my friends had were equally lack lustre
maybe i went there on a bad day
the other reviews here are really good
the staff were lovely and the restaurant itself was really nice so it could be worth going back for the two course lunch buffet they offer for
to give them another try
i think i might have to give this place another chance i will provide my experience here
but i can't say if this is the norm
basically
i arrived before the rest of my fellow diners
i didn't know if there would be four of five people in total
which apparently wasn't useful to the staff member
who instead of giving me a table which could potentially seat five
made me sit by the door until everyone_else arrived
it took a while for our waiter to take our orders
and when we finally received our food
i was not particularly impressed with what arrived
especially considering the prices
i ordered the navratan kofta
and pretty sure i got the palak kofta makhani instead
by the time we got our food
though
i was too hungry to send it back
the dumplings were absurdly salty
to the point where i almost couldn't eat them
on_the_other_hand
my dining companions seemed to enjoy their dishes
including some tandoori shrimp
after we finished_eating
we wanted to order some desserts
but after waiting over minutes to have our plates cleared
and even then we had to hail a waiter down to do that
we didn't have enough time
and just left
i think i'll stick with the red fort around the corner from here
been just the once but was very impressed
the restaurant itself is a little shabby around the edges but the food was delicious
would definitely go again
exceptional indian food
good service
proportions just right
good variety of starter
nans
seafood
chicken and lamb
disappointing the only gin was gordon's
wanted bombay saphire
exceptional indian food
fair price
good proportions
good service
delicious sea food
chicken
lamb dishes and sppetizers
only disappointment is they only had gordon's gin
wanted beefeaters or bombay saphire
highly_recommended
you know how curry_houses can be oddly stressful in communicating your order and such
this place isn't like that
the food got good reviews from everyone at the table and we were all happy with the service and overall experience
the jalfrezi sauce is some of the best i've ever had
everything was consistently good
not the best indian overall that i've ever had
but i'm really glad we stopped in
we were a group of six and they accommodated us without any trouble or eye rolling
reasonably_priced and delicious
it was during the fringe
as well
so the ability to handle a bigger group was impressive
truly excellent food
great service
an institution
average indian restaurant
i have both eaten here and had home delivery
and the food and service are both fine
most recently i had a goats cheese dish and lamb kadai with garlic_nan
the curry dishes should have been hot and spicy
they were medium hot i think this is another indian restaurant where they are afraid of making their dishes too hot probably because the average british palate cant handle it though i'm make assumptions here
price wise its fine also
i was including tip i can get cheaper closer to home
and of similar quality
i know indian and pakistani people who said this used to be a good indian
so maybe they have changed ownership
or just taken their foot off the gas
while i was in edinburgh
i decided to do a curry tour to hit a new indian_joint every night in search of the most flavorful and spiciest_curry
see
i eat spicy food like most people breathe air
back home
i get indian take away and add both habaneros and ghost pepper hot_sauce before i eat
so
you know
use that as a frame of reference
anyway
this was an elegant and classy looking restaurant that had a laid back and accommodating staff
the prices here were comparable to many in the area but higher_than a few gems that i found
even so
it was a quiet and intimate environment
and the food was great
the flavor of the vindaloo was excellent
it wasn't
however
very spicy at all
at least to me
i had to request they bring me something to spice up the dish more
when i did
though
they brought me a huge dish of pure chile pepper sauce that after mixing with my vindaloo did make the dish at least moderately spicy
that made me happy
so
nowhere near the spiciest_curry in edinburgh but a good restaurant that takes care of its customers
and definitely a staff that knows how to make a proper tasting vindaloo
i'd visit again next time i'm in the city
mezbaan often seem to be left out of favourite curry restaurant lists
it often seems to escape the limelight
this is undeserved
mezbaan is an indian restaurant specialising in south_indian_cuisine
every curry dish i have had hear is scrumptious
i have heard one person complaining that the curry wasn't authentic south_indian
i can't really comment on this
but i can give the taste and presentation a thumbs_up
and for me that's what a mattered
prices_are_pretty reasonable
i ate here with a friend
with two courses and it cost us around
also note that its byob
this shouldn't be a problem as being near tollcross there are several supermarkets
and actually a small grocers right next_door
mezbaan is a sensational restaurant
serving authentic south_indian_cuisine
situated in the tollcross area of edinburgh
mezbaan is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach
and with the outside of the restaurant painted a lovely bright maroon colour
it would be difficult to miss it
the mezbaan menu offers a vast range of authentic south_indian dishes such as kebabs and dosa's
rich pancakes served with a filling
i came here for dinner several months_ago with a friend and i had an absolutely beautiful meal
i had the mixed pakora's for a starter which were tasty
but my main_course of chili beef was definitely something to write_home_about
the beef was cut into the tiniest slices and then fried along with peppers and onions in a chili sauce yum
it was a pretty spicy meal
but definitely something that i would order again
the prices for the meals in mezbaan are quite reasonable considering it is in the tollcross area
the starters are priced at around five pounds and the main_courses are more expensive at about ten to fifteen pounds but the food is definitely worth it
mezbaan also do takeaways and home deliveries which is incredibly handy so they get a big thumbs_up from me
mezbaan has a slightly upscale atmosphere
a bit o the pricier side but authentic and extremely great customer_service
had the naden adu curry which was absolutely_amazing
the only downside is the price
for a cheaper fix for students i suggest the kebab_mahal in newington
dosa do or dosa don't
dosa do
blates
haven't a clue what i'm on about
then go to mezbaan and order a dosa or two
ok so you might not put your faith and dining option based entirely on my review before knowing what you're in for
i went with a mixed group_of_people
some who had travelled south_india and hadn't had a dosa since then
others who hadn't a clue what they were
i've recently learnt that there's a big difference between south and north_indian cooking
most
indian_restaurants
you get here serve north_indian style large curries and rice
food baby
food coma
nom but ooft
southern_indian cooking is
first off
a lot spicier and secondly they use a lot more bread and pancake like ingredients rather than rice
such as dosas
lentil and rice pancakes
stuffed with all sorts of delicious fillings
see uploaded photo
for want of another way to describe it
think crepes
they're kinda like that
but not
and the ones we got were considered small
apparently they can come twice as big
so
they're tasty
really tasty and much lighter than the traditional curry
and at mezbaan anyway
they're cheap
for a dosa
with a side of mango_chutney
home made and delicious
and some veg curry
and twice as filling as a sandwich that would cost probably a few quid more
yes please
i had the mushroom one that was nom
everyone_else had a masala_dosa
made with potato and there wasn't a crumb left
and someone had the lamb dosa which was personally my favourite
with some really fresh
fragrant sweet basil
totally getting that next time
i also got to taste both the mango_lassi and the almon and saffron lassi
the almond and saffron lassi came decorated with little strands of saffron that turned it yellow on top
it was certainly an acquired taste
as it wasnt too sweet
but did the perfect job at neutralising the spice
the main menu looked interesting too
smaller tapas dishes with things like honey chicken
never seen before on an indian menu
i think dosas might be one of my new favourite things
and rather than the odd dosa thrown in for good measure that other indian restaurnats might too
mezbaan specialise in them
so
in summary
dosa do
the food is good
but the service isn't and the venue is unlikely to impress
is the food good enough to compensate for the shortcomings
probably just about
but it's more of a quick dosa lunch place than an evening meal spot
overall
we said
mezbaan undoubtedly serves very tasty grub
but the overall restaurant experience feels a little odd
they definitely need to do something about the look of the place
as it feels unfinished
and given that the food they serve is likely to be at least somewhat unfamiliar to many of their customers
their service needs to be entirely more accurate and confident
as i won't be alone in seeking to rely upon recommendations from the waiters
despite these shortcomings
i'd still recommend that you pay mezbaan a visit
as their food is definitely worth_the_trip
sad to say i have to disagree with all the other reviewers about how great this place is
the restaurant gets two points for the food but ive docked another because of my
lost umbrella
and ehh service
we went to the restaurant and they told us to come back in minutes because they dont have any seats open
ok
so we go to the bar next_door
grab a drink and come back in minutes
still no seat available
by this time
i'm super hungry and about to fall over
but we wait
another minutes pass and finally we get seated
we ordered the overpriced thali and the salmon tikka
tomato rice and naan
naan was fine
salmon tikka was horribly fishy
thali was okay but wayyy overpriced
its essentially a hodgepodge of different curries
i mean
for all that
and the tomato rice
dont get me staretd on that
it tasted liek someone dipped all the rice into a vat of butter and handed to me on a plate
i am married to a south_indian so i know whats good
that was not good
naan was the only thing that was okay in my opinion and i saked for dry naan but again no one seemed to listen
the icing on the top was that we left our umbrella there and were clearly the last people in the restaurant
we call the restaurant to ask to pick_it_up and the guy said they didnt have it
come on really
its only an umbrella
would i recommend to others
that would be ahem
no
there's only one thing you need to know about mezbaan they do cheap as chips
in fact
probably cheaper_than chips
dosas for lunch or dinner
for a dosa as long as your arm that keep you full till past dinner time
seriously
check out the photo i uploaded of that bad boy
what is a dosa
pray tell
a lentil and rice flour pancake stuffed full of yummy spiced goodness
i love the peppered lamb
and the chicken_tikka is so flavourful
the most popular is the potato one
and mushroom is nice too
so
for the same price or in fact cheaper_than a pre packaged
factory prepared sandwich from marks spencers
i'd wager they're around right
you can get a freshly cooked dosa for
and on the side of this dosa there is a little side of cococnut raita
and a little side of vegetable_curry
i mean
really
there's also a menu of tapas dishes
so plenty of options but again just smaller portions
the dosa isn't small though
and i think the one i ordered was the small
with a bigger option being available
if you've never tried a dosa
go
try one
nom and be full
wow
good food and cheapest lunch i've had in a long time
i had the lamb dosa that was massive and deliciously filling
i thought they were all tapas size so ordered a second
chicken mango sauce
but when the samosa arrived i was realising i would have to ask for piggy bag
the place it self could do with a renovation at places water damaged wall paper hanging off one wall didn't really fit the otherwise rather posh table setting and ambience
staff_is_very_friendly and food comes out fast and fresh
a nice wee indian place
semi formal place
cheap dosas were a delight
service
not so fast
the dosas here are still stars
but after a recent dinner here
i do have to amend my review slightly
i'd only ever been for lunch before
the lunch menu has a much larger dosa menu
with at least different vegetarian and different meat dosas
these dosas are
smaller
and by smaller i mean the size of a small baby
they have lamb dosa
mushroom dosa
two types of chicken
so good
and only
for a potato dosa
masala_dosa
the dinner menu only has dosas total
and the only meat options are chicken or prawn
small prawns at that
they are also 'bigger' and by big i mean the size of your entire body
so big
equally delicious
but i was really disappointed when i asked if i could see the lunch time dosa menu and they said it wasn't available
it was a quiet monday night
and if they were making chicken_tikka dosas i didn't see why a mushroom dosa would be out of the question
the service was very proper
but a little confused
the girl who served us seemed very shy and unsure and had to re check several times
and then took quite a while to take our order
but it was still nice
they were friendly and eager to please
the restaurant itself is a bit worn and tired
and bizarrely posh looking
very fancy
like out of the s s attempts at being fancy
the floor
both myself and my dosa date noticed
was beautiful
old fashioned marble esque black and white tiles
i do think the decor could do with an upgrade
but the worst part was how cold it was
it was a cold january night outside and whilst the restaurant was warmer than outside
we both had to dine with our jackets on
and my toes were as cold as ice cubes by the time i left
and our food went cold very quickly
it really was far too cold to be comfortable to dine in
i will still come here for the dosas
and the dosas alone
they are wonderful
quite authentic and unusual to any_other_indian_restaurant in edinburgh
you get a free glass_of_wine with courses
well yes you do
tasty south_indian food
my goodness its coconut heaven
lovely food
nice_atmosphere and service was spot on
oh wow
i can't believe no one else has reviewed this place yet
i've been here twice and it was amazing both times
r and his family have been going here for a while now and love the place
we'll_be_back in edinburgh in a week and there's a chance we might be having dinner here one night so i'll be writing an updated review soon since it's been two years since i've been here
i'm hoping it's as good as i remember
if memory serves
they make the most amazing chicken_korma
wow my mouth is watering already
the khukuri is an excellent indian restaurant which serves amazing food and has friendly
efficient service to match
i came here with my flatmates late last year and we all thought it was great value_for_money considering what a good time we had
the restaurant itself feels quaint and cosy with neatly laid_out tables
relaxing decor and some of the most friendly_staff you could ask for
the menu has an extensive range of authentic indian dishes and prides itself particularly on the quality of its meat
i went for the lamb_rogan_josh which had tender chunks of lamb in an aromatic and flavoursome sauce
they also serve big
filling portions of rice to go with their main_dishes
we spent less than a tenner each when the final bill came which we all thought was excellent deal
this place is definitely worth a look
if i'd not eaten out again in town the night after i was here this past weekend i'd have thought i was maybe out of touch with prices through making use of deals and vouchers over the past few months
at per head for only main_courses
curries
rice and one naan
and beers this was more than i'd paid in quite a while but it does seem to be out of the ordinary thankfully
at least when you're missing out both a starter and a dessert
no complaints about the food itself
or for that matter the service although the waiting staff did seem to have the odd problem understanding my german guests
both of whom have an excellent command of english
so they're maybe used solely to edinburgh accents
i will not though be back here anytime soon
the food is good and the staff true nepalese
friendly and soft spoken
this brings me back to my time in kathmandu
a nice little restauran tfor which i've never yet had to book a table
food good
service excellent and very reasonable
the dishes are mostly indistinguishable from indian food but the ocassional nice surprise on the menu
a wee nepalese place that never struck me as one worth trying till my team leader got us there twice for lunch
and how glad i was for his recommendation
the first time we had l carte dishes
so i opted for the
very generous
lamb_biryani
which i found only nd best for the variety i have tried in edinburgh
some guys ordered the nepalese beer named khukuri
khukuri stands for the traditional nepalese blade
and they were impressed of the gentle and refreshing taste it has
brewed in london
for our second visit we tried out the excellent lunch deal
for two courses or
for three
where the third dish is either a coffee or a simple home made dessert
you have quite a decent choice for main_dish
and both the naan_bread and chapati were very tasty
there was also a mouth_watering starter
sekuwa
which you definitely need to try
grilled chicken with spices and an awesome sauce
in both cases i had mango_lassi
which helps balancing whatever spicy curry you will get
recommended over a beer
the service was very good in both cases
and the prices_are_very_reasonable
now i need to decide what dish to try next
i went here with a large_party
and the staff treated us like royalty
they brought out a number of starter dishes so we did not have to choose everything by single person
even accommodating for the vegetarians
they also have such a variety_of_dishes that when it came time to order for people
the staff were very patient
the food was great
served with some nepali beer
and a variety of rices and naan
the owner even gave_us
all
a small desert on the house because we were celebrating a birthday
they even wrote out a card
overall the dining_experience was great and matched the food as well
i highly enjoyed it
i'm back in edinburgh again for work
i knew there were some pretty good indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
but never truly got a recommendation
so this was my first time at an indian restaurant here
this is a punjabi restaurant
right off the haymarket bus stop
i took the bus from hotel to haymarket stop
walked about minutes
and found myself at this restaurant
i had the chicken_tikki_masala and the curried okra
bhindhi
one word
marvelous
served it with some rice and garlic_naan
of course
this is basically the only dishes that i order at any indian restaurant
the portions were enough to fill me up
i had maybe a little leftover
i have to admit that the okra was so good that no matter how full i was
i had to finish the dish because it was that great
the interior of the restaurant was pretty nice
it was a large restaurant
clean
with new furniture
as soon as we entered
we were led to our table
chairs pulled out to sit_down in
the only thing is
i smelled like the food when i left
but
i've run into that with many different restaurants so it was not a big_deal
so if you find yourself in edinburgh one day
indian food is pretty common and good
i would definitely recommend this restaurant
looks pricey
but not too bad
great location
right in the haymarket area
look for the corner with the big
about gbp per plate
they have a pretty average selection of indian punjabi cuisine and a lackluster selection of desserts
and booze
i have this incredibly rude habit of walking past restaurants with large windows and glaring at the people eating
this is exactly what i did with omar khayyam and promptly told my boyfriend we had to try it
the restaurant is quite bright and spacious due to the large windows
most indians seem to feel dark and dingy
but not this one
the staff were very friendly and service prompt
the menu lists the usual indian dishes you would expect
and there is a good selection
the price ranges up to around a tenner for a main
so it could get costly if you order a lot
i had a biryani which came as a huge portion
it was so delicious i felt bad leaving half of it
the other half had a lamb_rogan_josh which he wolfed down as men do
i enjoyed the poppadums
rice and naan_bread that we had alongside it
i literally felt_like if i was wearing a belt i would have to loosen to it
this restaurant is only two minutes walk from haymarket station so ideal if you are going to and from the station
they offer a set lunch meal also which would bring the price done significantly and definitely fill you up until tea time
i'm a bit of a spice pussy
so a korma will do me nicely thank you
but this korma is really good
you can just tell it's going straight to your hips though
it's too creamy to be good for you
my dad had a somewhat adventurous bhuna
and loved it
he said the meat was cooked well
which is a surprise
and the sauce was really tasty
all in all it was a good experience
however the price was a but hefty
albeit with a bottle_of_wine
it was a good experience though
omar khayyam is a great indian restaurant and although the prices_are_pretty steep
the food and service is excellent
i came here with my parents last year and we all thought it was amazing with authentic indian dishes ranging_from marinated sea bass to chicken_tikka_masala
i went for the shami kebab starter followed by the lamb tikka
they didn't take long at all to arrive and tasted great when they did
all the meat which they use is of the highest quality and the lamb was tender with no chunks of fat or sinew whatsoever
most mains cost at least and side orders of rice or vegetables are about each
it's not a cheap meal
but the food
service and general ambiance all make the cost well worth it
we are not the most at experienced indian food but we were impressed with the taste and quality of omar's food as well as the good service and value
having left a rather atmosphere lacking whighams wine cellar
i made the short journey to the crossroads at haymarket where i was off to treat myself to a curry
the crossroads are more a massive mess of ugly tram works
but omar khayyam is a beacon of chic and stylish light at what used to be a very busy traffic point
on approaching the front door to the restaurant
i was warmly greeted_by one of the servers who opened the inner door for me and showed me to a big table where i choose the comfy booth seat over the chair
he also offered to hang my coat up
which i declined as i just folded it neatly and placed it on the bench beside me
i arrived early
my date still on his way
but this didn't stop the waiter bringing me water
a glass of red_wine
and poppadums with dips
once my date had arrived and taken his seat
he was quickly approached by the ever efficient waiter and asked if he wanted a drink
to which he order a pint of kingfisher
they don't appear to have cobra here
and was brought this seconds later
we had a look at the menu
opting to just go for main_dishes and add a side
using the poppadoms as our starter
after ordering our mains
we started in on the poppadums that were nice and crispy and accompained with three very tasty dips
there was the regular mango_chutney
which was a bit to sweet for me
a spicy raita
and the best spicy onions i've ever had
the onions were fresh
mixed with bits of tomato in a zesty and spicy sauce that made them the perfect topping for the crisp poppadums
our food arrived so quickly that we hadn't even finished the poppadums yet
but the waiter solved that problem by putting the remaining poppadum on top of the naan_bread and leaving use with the dips
now the main_dishes
omg hello flavour explosion
i ordered the punjabi karahi with chicken and this dish was the perfect blend_of_spices and curry and a chilli kick
there was a really warming taste of cinnamon mixed in which just brought the dish to a five star_review rating
it was so good i ate all of it
even though i felt_like i'd have to roll myself home
my date had the black pepper chicken
which i used some naan_bread to dip in the sauce
i also found this dish very tasty and would be happy to order it next time i go
we shared pilau_rice
an onion naan
and a very tasty side of aloo palak
spinach and curried potatoes
the only thing left after we devoured this incredibly delicious meal was a bit of naan that neither of us could fit into our overly full tummies
so the food was outstandingly delish
but the service was also something to compete with
the waiters seem to always be there with what you needed and everything was served so quickly
but they made_us_feel comfortable to linger over our meal and not be rushed out the door
i also liked the hot towels they brought after clearing away the plates
these were proper hot towels not the lame wet tissue like ones you get in other places
the restaurant also looks like it's recently been done up and the decor is all sumptious dark colours and clean lines
clearly
i loved this place
i will definitely be making the extra journey to come here again for some more delicious curry delights
looks are deceiving
the restaurant looks quite expensive from the outside
and sitting smack bang in the centre of town you'd think prices would reflect its location
however
a decent meal will set you back less than per head
the restaurant is large and well kept
my last visit saw the tables packed
varied selection of favourite curries on offer
all dishes ordered were destroyed in about fifteen minutes with lots of head nodding
so the grub definitely hits the spot
i suspect the desserts are bought in so i steered clear of them and opted for a mango_lassi instead delicious
good option if_you_are_looking for a half decent curry that won't break the bank
meaning 'the food provider'
ann purna certainly does provide on many levels
boasting itself as a vegitarian restaurant
but also preparing meat dishes
this traditional_indian restaurant really blew me away
having been persuaded to go by a vegetarian friend
which i am not
i was pleasantly suprised to be so impressed with the vegetarian_dishes on the menu that i went for something totally meat free why go for meat when any restaurant can do that
and to be honest
i'm really glad that i did go for the bahar e nau korma as it was delicious
a combination of carrots
potatoes and kashew nuts
service was excellent
and over all the meal was cheaper_than i had expected
wandered in here my last_night in edinburgh a_few_weeks_ago
not really knowing what to expect
the uk in general is full of great indian_restaurants so i was excited to be trying some out
of course i didn't pay attention to the sign that read
the finest indian vegetarian gujarati cuisine
and seeing how i love my meat
i did not have high hopes
boy was i surprised
the food was absolutely incredible
my parents and i shared several dishes
matar reiggna
bahar e nau korma
ann purna baingan
a side of sindhri batata
along with some roti
every dish exploded with flavor and the portions were nicely sized
gujarati is a province in northwest india that is known for it's vegetarian cuisine and i was very happy to try some excellent authentic food from the region
the servers were all very friendly and happy to explain all of their interesting foreign dishes to us americans
if ever in edinburgh
definitely check it out
i got dragged in here by a vegetarian friend_of_mine
against all my principles
i'm definitely a meat person
i'm glad she coerced me into it though
the food was absolutely_amazing and made me eat my words about how it would be boring and bland
humble pie fully swallowed
my smug looking friend and i had their lunchtime buffet which costs
for all_you_can_eat
unlike a lot of indian places offering cheap buffets like this
the food was really well cooked to the same standard that you'd_expect if you'd ordered la_carte
the service was really friendly too
and we didn't have to think twice about whether or not we were going to leave a tip
and i'll definitely be heading back
although next time i'll be trying one of the few meat options i spied on their main menu
long story short
even if it were a veggie restaurant
it's that good that even the most carnivorous types will be suitably impressed
as it's not
you have absolutely no excuse not to give it a go
i finally visited ann purna the other night
as a vegetarian
i'm really glad there are so many vegetarian restaurants_in_edinburgh
especially a few more affordable ones
i've noticed some strange comments for some of the veggie restaurant reviews around edinburgh
some comment about the fact that despite the fact they eat meat they enjoyed a meat free meal
as if they are surprised that the addition of meat doesn't magically make something taste nice
the other common point made is that they didn't enjoy a vegetarian restaurant because it had no meat in it
it's sad that a restaurant can't be evaluated in its own terms
we don't review an italian saying
well i usually eat only thai food so this italian was a bit crap
i assume that even reviewers who claim they can't live without eating meat don't judge their morning toast by its absence of beef
so let me say that ann purna is a restaurant that serves great food irrespective of its absence of meat
if anything this proves just how flavourful
nutritious and filling vegetarian food can be
apparently they do serve some meat dishes when requested
but this seems pointless
so yeah
i thought the food here tasted great
my girlfriend and i ordered a sweet
coconut flavoured
creamy dish which brilliantly complemented another savoury
tomato based aubergine curry
along with the saffron rice
which remember you have to order separately as its not included in the price of the curry
this meal was satisfying
it was a little higher_than average price wise
when you take into account the curry
the rice
and probable bread
poppadoms or side dishes
all in all expect_to_pay around for a not too extravagant but filling meal
as for service
it was a bit of a let down
the staff were very welcoming but we had a bit of strange experience while ordering
the waiter seemed overly keen to get us to order a starter we just didn't want
he then insisted we ordered a side dish
we already wanted poppadoms
and when they arrived
it came with a range of chutneys to try
great
we thought
complimentary dips
only when we looked at our bill we discovered it wasn't complementary at all
they had seemingly brought us something and charged us without a word
to makes things stranger
they also deducted two of our poppadoms which actually were complimentary only they cost much less than the they charged us for the chutney without telling
i'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say they messed up
otherwise this was pretty unacceptable
you don't want a homely
student friendly
restaurant to rip you off
i look_forward to revisiting and finding out
this experience however couldn't detract from the excellent food
it was so good it's inspired me to be more adventurous with my own curry in future
as i mentioned before
i found the food filling
as someone with a big appetite this isn't often the case
i thought the portions looked small at first
but they didn't feel small after
the creamy dishes are especially filling
definitely recommended
just double check your bill
the best indian vegetarian food
the sign outside proudly proclaims
i admit
when i eat indian food
or any food for that matter
of the time it involves meat
every time
i recently went on a will ferrel movie binge
sorry for the awful references
back on track
so basically
my reference point for other vegetarian indian food is limited
but i can say i adored the food here
even the dips for our popadoms
there were of them
swish
were lovely
i ordered the fried
baked aubergine curry and split with my neighbour the other aubergine dish which was served chopped with nuts
of the two i prefered the one that was served with nuts as the aubergine was in big chunks
whereas with the other you couldn't really taste the texture of the aubergine
i also tried the aloo_gobi
potato curry
and it was amazing
the thing that struck me was that each curry_sauce had a completely different flavour
and you could really see the different spices in it
there wasn't a tikka masala
jalfrezi
or rogan_josh in sight
basically
this was authentic indian_cuisine
quite a lot of the dishes were also vegan
which was a big plus as the birthday girl we were dining with happened to be so
the only downer is none of the desserts were vegan
including the pineapple
mango and payaya
this confused me slightly
the house white wine was also very nice
which is a plus
the only reason i'm holding back that fifth star is that it was outside that night
a nd the restaurant was really quite cold
indian food is hot
warming
fragrant and it needs to be complimented by a hot
bustling interior
sadly
whilst not exactly outdoor temperatures
it was pretty cold
my food cooled quickly as a result
and my toes went numb
hmm
for authentic
good indian food
not
british
indian
even the sworn meat_eaters like myself won't fail to be disappointed
friendly service too
sometimes when you want indian food
you don't know exactly what dish your tummy is asking for
so the answer of course is the indian lunch buffet
my first visit to ann purna was a smashing success
i was on my own
so had plenty of time for
too
many visits to the food table
the pakora starters were fresh and crispy
with the vegetables as the star
not the batter
they offer a small selection of main_dishes
and to be honest
when i took my first look at them
i was prepared to be underwhelmed
the sauces looked watery and they seemed to have some vegetable combos i didn't recognize
although as a anglo my vegetarian indian_cuisine knowledge is somewhat limited
however
the food was simply wonderful
my favorite was what i think was a saucy variation of aloo_gobi
it was deliciously sweet
creamy spicy
the lentil dal
which i usually don't care for
was a great excuse for more basmati naan
which was fresh and puffy from the oven
i was early for lunch
just before noon
and sat and read while the buffet was prepared
i think it was ready to go between
i ate so much i didn't want supper later that evening
so it was a good value for me
what a great location in st
patrick's square
easy to get to from the city centre and the university
and about a mile walk home for me
i've been here twice
pre and post makeover
and the food is divine
a little different from most places as it is vegetarian
but the food is so good you won't even think about the lack of meat dishes
recommended
sometimes with yelp you can get a bit carried away with the idea of a place that the reality can let you down
it wasn't really the case
although i think i would shy away from describing the food here as incredible
but it at the same time
extremely good and what is more
entirely up my vegetable strewn street
as i was incapable of making a decision on such an aubergine heavy menu
oh how i love you so
and the boy lost without meat options
we chose both thali options
to get a few different taste sensations
as we did with a green pea
aubergine and potato dish coming out on top for us
followed by chickpea and potato as well as a mixed_vegetable bhaji
the rice was perfumed with spices
the chapattis burning hot from the oven
i wasn't blown_away by the samosas or pakoras
and found the dhal lacking in flavour
but overall
the quality of food was high
have to give a nod to the service as well
very friendly and pleasant to be around
there was an introduction to some of the dishes on our plates when they arrived
glasses of water part way through and offerings of complimentary drinks at the end
which we were too stuffed to accept
i will also note that although i did enjoy the poppadoms
had more flavour than others i have tried
and the multitude of chutneys a fiver for the pleasure was much too high as noted by a reviewer for another restaurant
there is a large markup on puffs of air
and i definitely experienced that last_night
and we paid nearly eight quid on one beer and a fresh orange and lemonade
which also seemed rather steep to me
i have to note though
prices for the rest of the meal seemed much more reasonable
but it will be sometime to remember for my next visit
it was busy on a saturday when i was there so service was slow
i tried to overlook the fact that the table beside us were served before us even though they arrived after us
the food was fine
nothing special
i like when you are automatically given a jug of water in an indian restaurant but it took quite a while to get any water when we asked for it
we paid our bill and then finished up our drinks
as we walked out of the restaurant we were called back by two waiters and accused of not paying for our meal
i won't be in a hurry to return
omg
what a terrible experience
we picked this restaurant by chance and so many things went wrong here's a detailed report
it showed from the very beginning
i and my friend were given a seat and menu on a set table for four
during browsing
the waiter removed the things from the two other seats as it should
but he also took our empty wine glasses without even asking if we are taking wine
well
we ordered a thalli
pounds
which included a started and also a side
accompanying
portion each
the waiter asked if we want a poppadom and accepted
he did not tell us the price
i asked for a wine_list
but the had only local wine
pounds glass
we also wanted a jug of water
we got served glasses of water with ice
and the glass_of_wine very quickly
and an acceptable mins later the poppadom arrived
it was very thin and breaks in small pieces
so i am not sure if it was the way it should be
two poppadoms came with sauces
my friend drank her glass_of_water and ask twice for a jug of water but was in vain
i had to stand up by the bar and ask it specifically
and then it was served
in the meantime some new diners came along and took a seat beside us
mins passed after finishing our poppadom and we have not yet been served
i drank my wine already
then we saw two thali dishes coming at last we said
but
they were served to the diners who came after us beside us
we kindly pointed_out the issue
and the waiter said ours is coming soon
no problem'
the diners besides us apologized
even if they had not to but they were british
after minutes the waiter brought two large plates
we started to wonder why
then mins after a single thali dish
we asked were is the other one
the waiter disappeared and ignored us
we realized the two plates are for sharing so we called the head waiter
a indian with a green t shirt
and after consulting with the waiter
who was kind inexperienced and not focused
he said it is coming because the waiter took an order of instead
my friend who was scottish was complaining and stood up to leave away
so the waiter said he will give the nd thali for free to compensate the mistake
being so hungry
and did not want to waste time during sat night at the fringe we accepted
so we shared the first one
and then mins after the second one arrived
while eating the second thali
we realized that there should have been a starter included
so we asked the neighbouring diners
who took the same thali
and confirmed they did had a starter
so there we go for another complaint and the waiter replying its
ok
i bring it now
more mins
and so we ended eating the starter at the end of the main_course
then we just wished to leave asap and asked for the bill
it was a notepad page with the price in barely legible red ink
except the final price which was gbp
i realized he did not gave the nd thali for free
so again went personally for complaining
and he said oh yes sure then its pounds
then still
on the way out we were asing if the price of was right was a poppadom
wine
thali and side portions
and jug of water
perhaps we were charged for this
by the way
i forgot to tell you that from the two side portions only one came
vegetables with spices
few shredded lettuce
a sliced tomato
rings of cucumber and cinnamon the only spice
yck
actually we got a chat with the neighbour diners who were sorry for us and told us that they have been here months_ago and was very good
but now the management changed and they also did not liked the long waiting
that was my experience
so you can judge for your future considerations
the raj seem to always have an offer of prices
they certainly are reasonable
it's a nice restaurant which actually has a cinema at the back
the windows look out over the water of leith and at night it's a very cosmopolitan outlook
they do a green chicken dish which has to be seen to be believed
i've even been there for christmas dinner and that was smashing
the raj is a long established indian restaurant and takeaway in the shore area of leith
i tried it out for the first time a_few_weeks_ago after they put a menu through my door
proof that direct marketing works sometimes
the deal was that you could order any two curries
two rice
nan
poppadoms and two beers for
this is ridiculously good value and you would be hard pushed to find anywhere_else that could better it
we drove down to collect the meal
so i was able to have a look inside the restaurant too
it is perhaps in need of a bit of an update
but still looked like a pleasant enough place to have a meal and the view outside over the water made leith look like amsterdam
meaning very pretty
not full of prostitutes
the food was tasty and the lamb in my gosht hindustani was good quality and not sinewy or fatty
next time i fancy a curry
i'll give the raj a ring
i cannot sing this restaurant's praises enough
i can truly say
hand on heart
my favourite indian restaurant that i've ever been to anywhere
i've been here many times and have never not enjoyed or even been disappointed with any of the dishes i've eaten
the flavours and spice combinations that explode in_your_mouth during each bite is spectacular truly a pleasure
what are you waiting for
go now
this restaurant is at the corner of my street at is a convenient place for a little bite to eat
staff are nice but the price is to much for the quality you reserve
not the best indian meal i have ever had
it is a bit dated and its reputation is better than in reality
wouldn't tell people not to go but there are better indian_restaurants close by
my boyfriend and i had been attempting to cut down on the number of takeaways we were eating
and had been doing so well
until last_night when laziness and a desire for curry overcame us and we ordered from the raj
we'd not ordered before
but being leith residents had walked by a few times and had heard of 'curry in a hurry' so thought we'd give it a go
and set to choosing what we wanted from the leaflet pushed through our letterbox a couple of weeks_ago
the deal advertised on the front is for two curries
chicken
lamb or veg
two rice
a naan
poppadoms and two 'free' beers for
pretty decent
it doesn't specifiy any further than that
but it would appear that despite ordering two chicken curries
sag and pasanda
two rice
albeit one of them pilau
a naan
peshwari
and poppadoms we obviously didn't qualify for the discount
perhaps our tastes in rice and naan meant we were disqualified it would be a better idea for the leaflet
and the website
i checked
to specify what rice and naan were included
our total was
which was about p more than i'd calculated off the menu
the rice was fine
although the container wasn't completely full like most are
and the curries were decent
the sag was nicely spicey
and my boyfriend said he'd be happy to order the pasanda again
and most_importantly to a poppadom fiend like myself
the poppadoms were absolutely fine
is it possible to get a truly excellent poppadom
i don't know
but you can certainly get bad ones
i can't say anything was particularly outstanding
and it's annoying to find out when the delivery arrives that you have to pay more than the advertised deal
but the food was okay and delivery was prompt
though not quite as swift as the half an_hour i was told on the phone
we may well order again
but with so many indians to choose from we'll probably keep trying to find 'the one'
i've been to the raj a few times since_moving to leith years_ago and always thought it was ok
i went last month however and it was just a bit tired
no one there really seems to care about the business
which saddens me as it's a lovely spot with some unique stuff about it
the portions aren't particularly big
for the price you pay certainly
and none of the food really delighted me
i hope things improve before long
my local takeaway and very hit_or_miss
the prices are excellent for what you get and although i've yet to have a bad meal from here
there is really absolutely no consistency to their offering
i'm a pretty simple gal when it comes to my tastes with indian food and although i'll occasionally wander off piste i more often than not order the same thing
as such i've had a pretty good litmus test over the past year for that lack of consistency sometimes my chicken passanda is lovely and creamy with a thick sauce that's just made for dipping naan_bread in
and sometimes it's incredibly watery and soupy
likewise
the peshwari_naan wobbles about from divine to woeful
on a good day the inside will be beautifully coated
bright orange and so flavoursome you almost don't want to dip it in anything
whereas other times it looks like they just threw some dessicated coconut inside as an afterthought
a lot of this seems to be down to the day of the week
with weekends having the stronger serving
but i really wish they could just nail this all week round
although i've ordered takeaway from the raj
i doubt i'd ever choose to have a sit_down meal there
the decor is incredibly tired and a bit grubby
it's not often very busy either which does bring the ambiance down a little
it could probably do with some background music to try to perk the place up a bit
they could also do with installing a till system
they simply tot up your order using a menu and a calculator and i don't think i've been quoted the same price for the same meal more than once
in summary
amazing food at weekends and a fab price
but pretty woeful otherwise
my favorite study break over eating place or post pint feast site
kebabs are great
the mushroom and lamb_curry is amazing
you will likely have tummy issues after but it's worth it
cheaper_than most places around
i miss you
a lot
im glad that when i get back all the tourists will be gone and we can rekindle our love
i will ask for a chicken_tikka_masala
and i will carress and love it before inhaling it and licking the plate
please behave while im gone
awesome even though i wasn't too adventurous with tikka masala
which is my gold standard to compare others to
it was fantastic
service was excellent and the price was just right
fantasies of you are inspiring me to finish my phd proposal that will be the only hope of our reunion
please don't change
except maybe you could get more tables
and do delivery
and revamp the toilets
but nothing else
if i don't get accepted
or funding
i will be your us rep and together we will conquer a country of generally mediocre indian food
xxoo
i am addicted to this place
i go twice a week
every week
i can't believe they don't deliver
they won the best curry award for
hands_down my favourite indian place in edinburgh
the lamb bhuna is amazing
aside from near perfect food
the atmosphere is nice
and the owner is a very gracious man who is eager to take care of his patrons
i miss eating there
and it will be atop my list of eateries when i return to the 'burgh
and if you haven't tried it
their baklava is the best i've ever had
and only about a quid per piece
decadent
sumptous
mouth_watering
exquisite
superlatives really do struggle to adequately describe just how good the food is at kebab_mahal
while their kebabs are approximately one million times better than the sweat soaked doners you'll find in am joints
it's the curries that really take the biscuit
quite simply
they are the best i've_ever_eaten
talking_about them doesn't do them justice
you simply have to try one for yourself
i've only been to kebab_mahal once and that was the first night after i moved into my new flat last summer
four of us turned up and waited for about five minutes for a table because it was well beyond maximum capacity as it was so busy
i ordered the lamb balti with rice and a naan and we were eventually seated
the atmosphere is particularly special as it is ethnically diverse with cool music and amazing smells wafting from the kitchen
it was a very fortunate thing that it had a good atmosphere because we literally waited for about an minutes for our food arrive
but when it did it was well worth it
the lamb was good quality with virtually no sinuous or fatty bits amongst it and the flavour of the sauce was delicious
it was seriously spicy
but my flatmate ordered the chicken madras which blew my head off after just a mouthful and he was literally dripping with sweat after about five minutes of eating it
kebab_mahal serves authentic_indian_food at relatively cheap prices and is definitely worth a visit for an amazing dinner any night of the week
as the name suggests they specialise in kebabs and
although i haven't tried them myself
they're meant to be incredible
i had heard amazing things about this kebab house
but not being a kebab lover myself i didn't know how to judge it
i was surprised at how tasty the meat was i didn't think the huge chunk of meat on the spit looked appetizing until it was sliding down my throat
i must admit i've only been once and it was following a rather liquid lunch
but i'll be back and explore the menu further
but so far so very
very good
helllllllllllllllllo kebab_mahal
you tryin to make me fat
so goood
one day i'll come to this restaurant not be able to leave the food is so bang on
damn
i thought this place was a secret
this place is what yelp was made for
if you did not know you would probably would not bother
this place is no secret to folks who love decent curries
lots of regulars from the local indian community to be found here and always some student newbies
occasionally with american accents
mister khan is really nice fellow and his friends in the back make tremendous curries
you could just wander in here and get a kebab or some pakora
however
the folks who know will sit in the back
get yourself a lovely beverage
no alcohol served like all of the best indian_restaurants
and enjoy the fabulous curries
the portions are immense and the curries and breads are always well made
finally
when you leave the price will startle you
it is stupidly low priced
wouldn't it be great if all of the places that looked kebab_mahal were this good
a nasty looking off license with a security screen had some lovely chimay or gambrinus in the beer chiller
or a cheap cafe that served the greatest breakfast ever
so
i told you yeah it is great now don't spoil it
the curries are so hot in this place that even the onion bhajis were too hot for me
really cheap
great curry if you can take the heat
good for both take out and eating in
but it's quite small
excellent curry in a family_run establishment with a total of six tables
the service is quick and the food is great
we had chicken_tikka_masala
excellent
and lamb bhuna
very good
thank you
yelpsters
for a great tip
great for a quick lunch
so tasty
best kebabs in edinburgh
service a bit slow but hey
it's busy for a reason
small spot not great for a large_group
large portions
good prices
and it tastes great
if_you_are_looking for a good curry or kebab
then this is your place
i can't imagine there's a better place in all of edinburgh
cheap and casual
it would be easy to mistake kebab_mahal for just another place that sells processed shaved meats
its unassuming and dated appearance not doing it any favours however the old saying is true one should not judge a book by it's cover
the food is excellent from the mild rich and creamy chicken_tikka_masala to the more spicy madras or vindaloo which have a good balance of heat and flavour and real kebabs
the only thing ever to take me by surprise is that the chicken pakora is on the bone delicious but something to be aware of
to sum up
yes it can be very busy
is small and looks dated however if you want good food at a good price kebab_mahal is one of the best places to get a curry in edinburgh and i for one hope it never changes
i would call this little gem one of edinburgh's hidden secrets
although judging by all the positive comments on here perhaps it's not that well hidden
from the outside it looks like a ropey kebab shop
but step inside and you'll be treated to some of the best_indian_food_in_town
the naan breads are big soft pillows and the currys are bursting with flavour
yes
even the korma
i am currently
as i type this
the very proud parent of a food baby which i named after it's daddy wee mehal
it's been less than a few hours since i had my first kebab mehal meal and one i'll remember for a long while yet
all the reviews_on_yelp are true
it's simply fantastic
i feel i can't add much to what has already been said
sometimes on yelp you find a business that has some star
some star reviews
some people adore it
some people are impartial
and occasionally someone disliked it
but kebab mehal
reading through the others
is certainly 'one size fits all' in the best way possible
if your size consists of elastic waisted relaxi pants
it helps
it looks like nothing on the outside
or rather
it looks like every other kebab shop you see
and there are a lot of kebab shops in edinburgh that are in equal parts kebab shop and pizza chip
only frequented after am when under the influence
in this respect
do not judge this book by its cover
inside it is plain
a diner
a bit scaffy
not a criticism
just the way it is
but smells that greet you
oh and the sight of those freshly_made poppadoms and pakoras
the menu is simple
there is no signature dish
it's just
all of it is brilliant
as charles says
it's family_run
the owner manager
was very friendly
the service prompt although certainly no frills
all i'll say is
the food is amazingly good indian
no runny sauces
tough meats
instead fresh breads
super spicy dips
hot off the grill lamb
the vegetable_biryani
with a side serving of biryani sauce
was loaded with
well veg
there's also pools of that ghee oil at the end which comes back to haunt you
but you don't even care
it was that good
definitely not a 'meal out' type place
if you're going on a fancy date
or a family meal
you come in from the cold at pm on a freezing january day
you keep your coat on whilst you eat
you stay half an_hour and savour the food
or you come at night after a dance class
still sweaty faced
and refuel on the tastiest carbs around
it's no nonsense
but delicious
and i think i'm a little bit in love
i live almost around the corner from the kebab_mahal and i loveeeeeeee it
there really isn't that much more to say that's not been said before
i'm very
very picky about my doner kebab
that's how we write it in dutch
shut it
and i love what they do here
they just can't do a thing wrong
if you ask me
their meat is absolutely_delicious
their wraps are gorgeous and the dressings are good and proper the way they should be
it's the one place that makes me feel at home in edinburgh
pop in
especially after a late_night out
this place will make you very happy indeed
right
so after my last review of kebab_mahal
i decided that i was hungry
so i went back to kebab_mahal
of course
this time i went for the lamb_curry something i hadn't tried before and
being indonesian and curry prone myself
i think i died of bliss
i shuffled in
holding my stomach
bent over and clearly in the final stages of hunger pains
after having placed my order and being greeted_by almost all of the friendly clientele and staff the curry arrived
a light opened up above me
trumpets sounded
a harp was gently plucked
and i may or may not have taken a nose dive into the curry
look
i'm sensitive to heat and so this burnt my throat and mouth to a point of angst ridden pain but it was soooo good that despite the pain
i couldn't stop_eating
my fault for trusting them when they said there were very few chillies in there
almost none
what am i saying
i'm saying get your bee hinds over here and have ye some curry
doesn't get better
really doesn't
and they're so incredibly friendly
as a matter of fact
why
i do believe it's almost lunch time
muahhahaha
we made a beeline here after the rave reviews and
forewarned
we weren't expecting a fancy place
maybe it was because we were looking_forward to it so much that our expectations were somewhat dimmed
the food was generally average
we felt
my vindaloo was spicy enough but the meat was a bit tough and
temperature wise
could've done with being hotter
the naan was not great and didn't seem fresh or have that
just cooked
fluffiness
service was adequate
but slow
as there was a steady stream of people picking_up takeouts
you help yourself to soft_drinks from a chiller at the back
the prices were reasonable
sorry
other lovers of this place
but mother_india is miles better
and not a lot more expensive
so we'll be sticking to that
or kebabish
why oh why have you led so far astray yelp
this hole_in_the_wall restaurant was to be a great secret delicious place
instead it turned out that it was a filthy hovel with terrible starch to fill the belly
waiters with foul yellow stains from their own food eating misadventures
meat sitting in unrefridgerated counters and a dining_room that resembled the boiler room from a b horror film
the food was not cheap in comparison to some amazing restaurants we enjoyed at lunch such as mussel and steak just a short walk away
i know this is supposedly a good place for university students but i would gladly go back to ramon noodles and fluorescent mac and cheese
they seat you at a dingy table while you contemplate running out before someone notices you and then man with a untucked shirt with stains and an unkempt beard asks for your order
the smell of stale food and dry spices fill the nostrils and then the food arrives
rice that's lukewarm and veggies straight from the freezer in spices to hide the freezer burn taste
singed bread that is cool as well and soon you wonder if all they have in the kitchen is a freezer
a toaster and an old microwave
the bill is not printed out but rather shown to you on a calculator
hmm i wonder why
do yourself a favor and call the health inspector on this burke and hare show they call an indian restaurant
run
es la mejor comida india que he probado
es un garito cutre llevado por una familia pero
la comida es absolutamente deliciosa y abundante
vale la pena
tasty food for a reasonable_price
not the nicest venue however if i lived in edinburgh i would frequent this place for sure
this is just a tiny place run by a few guys
but it gets packed and is well worth squeezing in
we had some fantastic samosa to start
then dove into tikka masala and lamb bhuna
both of which were amazing
price was shockingly reasonable
cheap even
hard not to love
tipsy and craving some delicious nighttime kebab
kebab_mahal will be there for you with a delicious doener filled with greasy meat
drippy sauces
and garlic breath the next morning
kinda grotty and not the absolute best doener place in edinburgh
but it will forever hold a special place in my heart
and likely my arteries
do not judge a book by its cover
and certainly do not judge kebab_mahal by its appearance
it will reward you with one delightful indian food experience
from the chicken_tikka karahi to lamb tikka bhuna
every plate is delicious and generous on the size
accompanied with a couple of nans and you have an unforgettable ethnic feast
our meal ended with a baklava and a kataifi which was equally delicious and we hardly reached a bill
best indian in edinburgh for sure
and if you know the cardinality of the set
indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
that says a lot
i'm sad this place is so well known i thought it was my friends and i
are own little secret
but since the cat is out of the bag i am yelping it
this place is hands_down the best curry shop in the whole city
it's the perfect little hole_in_the_wall and when i first walked by it i took one look at it and knew this place was going to be good
my saudi friend then took my here and i was hooked
i was ready to come wash dishes in exchange for food
what can i recommend
all of it seriously
but the creme of the crop is
chicken_tikka_masala
the creamy sauce with the melt in_your_mouth chicken
drool
sooooooo good
the owner is the kindly gentleman with the big white beard so if you see him tell him how wonderful his food is and his establishment
because i always always see him working there and all that hard work has paid off to blossom this place into the best curry this side of india or pakistan hands_down
i do not get the hype here
the food was at best average
it is not a hole_in_the_wall
and it is definitely not fast_food
it is just a mediocre restaurant
the food was so oily that i am pretty sure it seeped through our plastic bag
we ordered the mixed_vegetable curry
the mushroom bhaji and the tarka dhal
i honestly could not taste much as my mouth was coated in oil
we also waited minutes and watched people who came in after us get their take away before us and get served before while sitting down
no explanation
no apology for how long it took and the fact that we got frog jumped by everyone and their mothers
the lamb kebab was ok
but coming here was my biggest regret of our trip
erm
this place is amazing
i've heard about the kebab_mahal on the edinburgh grapevine for years
but for some reason i never felt the need to go there
but now i always feel the need to go there
because the food is fantastic
and oh
so cheap
this is not a posh restaurant
oh no
it's formica tables and stools and weird items stuffed up the back of the room
there's even two parts to the place
separated by a proper wall and accessible only by going outside and entering another main door
this is what i like to call personality
me and my other half had an incredible meal here
in the completely separate restaurant from everyone_else
we ordered a starter of onion bhajis
three arrived the size of steering wheels
followed by a veritable feast of indian main_courses
i opted for two sides and a naan to keep me filled and the bloke opted for a main_course
rice
naan and a side
we couldn't finish it all and took the rest home
all that wonderful food only came to
and the service was good too our waiter was pleasant and we even helped him shift some tables to accommodate us
it felt_like a mad family meal will absolutely
definitely
totally be back for more
long live kebab_mahal
i loved the food here
as they say dont judge the book by the cover
dont judge this place by the looks and the board which boasts pizza and doner kebab on it
the food is good authentic indian and tandoori food cooked brilliantly and is cheap
the service is friendly and of course extra friendly for me as i could speak the language
the saag panner was excellent as was the bhindi_masala
the samosa was spicy and the rotis were huge
tried the special tea and raas malai for dessert and it was excellent
in fact the dessert was the favourite part of my meal
all up with three courses it was quid for two to have dinner including drinks
not bad for what was a big meal
i would drop in here regularly if i could
need a cheap meal
then this is the place to go
great sized curry for was yummy too
super unfriendly and unhelpful staff though
cleanliness of the place was a bit gross
our table hadn't been wiped and floors looked like they hadn't been mopped in a year
on our
me and hubby
two day visit to edinburgh
this was one of the best finds
a hole_in_the_wall kinda restaurant
seems to be very busy and dishes out absolutely lip smacking dishes with ease
we had been to kebab_mahal twice and both the times we loved the food
if you are one of those people who prefer posh restaurants over good food
then my friend this place is not for you
this place looks more like a fast_food_joint but but but
the food is nothing like fast_food
the two times we were here we tried the shammi kebab
chicken tandoori
chicken bhuna
kharahi murgh accompanied with super yummy tandoori garlic_naan
all the dishes including the naan was absolutely_delicious
at the end after you have stuffed yourself with these goodies
if you still have any room left for dessert do try the baklava
best baklavas i have ever tasted
we also tried the almond cake which was also yummmm
delicious food
excellent service and warm welcoming staff awesome gastronomic experience
this place has phenomenal indian food
it's true to the culture and very authentic
try it and you'll be blown_away
i must agree with the first reviewer
sensational indian
i would have given it stars had the dudes working there at least cracked a smile
i've been there at least times and not even a twitch
great food though and only do takeaway
they've jumped a to a stellar stars
not because the food rose to another level as i really don't think it possible
being top of the indian taste ladder as they are
but because
wait for it
i managed a joke with the guy behind_the_counter
finally
wonders never cease and the delta indian takeaway is no
i received
and binned
a whole lot of spam and flyers when i moved into my new flat
but made a point to save at least one of the following
internet offers
pizza places
indian take outs and italian restaurants
the name of this indian restaurant in the west end definitely caught my attention
and the flyer was so fancy i felt the food couldn't be that bad
other than being a restaurant
they're definitely marketing themselves as a home delivery take out
the menu consists of pakoras and samosas as starters
quite an extensive list of curries
many manyyyy side dishes and the typical rice and bread accompaniments
i've only had home delivery with the indian cavalry club
i deviated from my usual chicken_korma and tried the fried paneer
it's fried cottage_cheese
with pasanda curry
a bit unusual at first
but it was quite good
i've had a little peek at the restaurant itself
an elegant looking place and i hope to eat there soon
as for now
i'll be on the lookout for some slightly cheaper indian take outs for home delivery
despite the fact that there are two indian_restaurants withing m of my flat
this place is supposedly the best place to get curry in edinburgh
being a big curry fan
i'm a man who drinks beer and watches football
of course i love curry
i thought it'd be worth checking out
luckily
i have friends who have birthdays and also like curry
so we went on one of said friend's birthdays
now i love making curry myself
properly
not from a jar
i get my spices from kamco on south clerk st
you should go the samosas there are amazing
and i like to think i'm a bit of a dab hand at curry
so i'm rarely impressed when i go out for one
this place just seemed to get everything wrong
first of all
we had to take out a mortgage to pay for it
overpriced
that's not the word
rip off
when you're paying upwards of a head for curry you expect something pretty special
it was ok
but it definitely wasn't special
it was too salty for a start
and the waiters were rude and unhelpful
they seemed to think they were above me
which irked me
i'll not ever be going back
and now i owe northern rock a fortune
best indian food i've_ever_eaten
service was slow but good
would highly_recommend this to anyone that likes indian
super resto indien
et je pense tre assez difficile
cadre chic
pas loin du centre
service correct
bon rapport qualit prix
tr s bons currys
bonnes sauces menthe et mangue

we were in edinburgh for a few days and staying at the caledonian waldorf astoria hotel
which is only a few mins walk from this restaurant
we wanted to have a nice indian meal
and decided_to_give this place a try
that was where we went wrong
the concierge at the hotel called ahead for us
when we arrived at the restaurant
we were seated in the front room
restaurant is simple and classy looking
and it was only about full
we were given menus
and ordered drinks right away
while we were placing our food order
the drinks arrived
out of our party of
one person only wanted water
and a few of us asked for water also
it took us mins plus to order
as the menu is a little complicated
and they carry some untraditional items
we ordered some starters and also wanted some rice with them
this took time
the menu said plain basmati_rice
when we said we want some plain basmati_rice
we received some snotty comment about all of the rice dishes being basmati_rice
we finally got the waiter to understand what rice we wanted
at which point he questioned why we wanted rice with the appetizers
we want it
that's why
then came the main_dishes
i wanted some kheem
traditional_indian lamb_curry
waiter decided to educate me on what
kheema
is
then he told me that they had minced lamb
but wanted to know what curry_sauce i wanted it with
i asked
i picked one and he told me that i should try something else
he suggested another dish
which i said i don't enjoy
he told us that if i had it in america
then i should still try it here
as americans don't know how to cook
of us are american
so this too did not go over well
we finally finished ordering and the drinks arrived
no water
or glass of ice
so we asked about it and were told to be patient and that it was coming
a little while later
our papad
poppodum
was brought out
once we finished with these
the appetizers came out
they decided to bring out the food without clearing the table
so we had to help clear the plates
so they had space to put the food down
we had ordered some chocked pakoras
masala_dosa
lamb kebabs and a prawn an potato crepe
food was ok
nothing spectacular
when the started were brought to the table
we asked for more chutney
and specifically asked for some tamarind and some green chutney
half way through the appetizers
we stopped eating and finally got the attention of one of the waiters to ask them about the chutneys
as we needed them to eat out food
again were were dismissed rudely and told it was coming
waiters were just standing around taking as not doing anything
this was the last straw
so we told them we wanted to see a manager and to cancel our entrees
the wait_staff told us we could not do that as our food was already ordered
told them to get a manager on the phone
after asking for the manager
our regular waiter came by and just started talking to us as if nothing had happened
i stopped him and told_him again to call the manager and to cancel our main_courses
we paid for what we had consumed and left
on our way out
we spotted another person who said that he was one of the owners
we spoke with him and the waiter for a few mins
but the waiter was just defensive and didn't think he had done anything wrong
we walked out and went to mother_india
avoid indian cavalry club at all costs
service is atrocious
and there are better ways to waste your money and
more importantly
time
we've got loads of indian takeaways nearer to us than this
but we always go here
it's worth_the_trip
the food is great
what more do you need to know
oh all right
the chicken puri is excellent it's a starter
but if you don't have a huge appetite it's a big enough portion to qualify as a main
i like their lamb bhuna
spicy enough to have a kick without making your eyes water
and nice tender chunks of lamb
this is one of my favourite restaurants_in_edinburgh
the food here really is delicious
i first heard about it when i was in first year and on the last day of living in halls we decided to treat ourselves to some decent food
ever since
we have always ordered from shapla to celebrate birthdays
end of term or any little event good enough to get an excuse to get one
although the restaurant describes itself as serving bangladeshi cuisine
you will also find indian and other asian dishes being served up here
you can order online via their_website and the delivery time was about half an_hour
which is pretty good
i have been trying to work my way through their menu and there hasn't been one meal where i had finished it feeling dissatisfied
all the meals are full_of_flavour and are well portioned to ensure that you are full by the end of them
best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
this is straight takeaway
you order
you wait
you get your food
you leave
or you could have it delivered
whichever you prefer
they give you a ton of food
one dish could feed a family
inexpensive
flavorful
and well worth the walk to go get it
i tried three different dishes
two different_types_of rice
two types of nan_bread
and the fried bananas
all of it was good
spicy
and chalk full of flavor
all of the indian food i've had and rated now seem second best
i guess i'll have to go to edinburgh again to get some
consistent quality and service
love in all the details
big portions
complex flavour that is made by someone who really understands cooking
i'm vegetarian and they always make me extremely happy
even going so far as to make special dishes for my fussy year_old
love me some shapla
this was such a disappointment
firstly
the curry itself was average at best my tikka massalam was distinctly nippy
much spicier than it ought to have been
now i'm fine with heat but a lot of people aren't and you don't expect a tikka massalam to be hot
my boyfriend's passanda was so so
it wasn't just the sauce
the chicken was dry too
just not nice
and
worst of all for a poppadom lover like me
i received fewer than i'd ordered so i'd been shortchanged
when i phoned to complain i was fobbed off with the explanation that the kitchen doesn't get told how many poppadoms people have ordered
they said to mention next time and i'll get what i ordered but i won't be ordering again
i actually think i ordered from here a few months_ago and the same thing happened then
so much for being one of the best indian takeaways in edinburgh
if you go to edinburgh and you want to eat indian
you go here
the food is so
so much better than indian food you can get in america
and also so so much better than any other indian place i ate in edinburgh or london
the servers are hilarious
especially the main guy
who always teased me about my orders and knew my name and culinary preferences by the second time i'd even been to the restaurant
if i lived in this city
you'd bet i'd be eating here weekly
if not nightly
gur balti is an amazing indian restaurant on dundee terrace which consistently offers delicious food and great service at reasonable_prices
i've been here twice with some friends and both times we've gone away more than satisfied with the whole experience
they pride themselves on serving some of the best indian food in the city and each dish is presented immaculately
the menu has loads to choose from and the last time i was in i went for the balti chicken passanda
it seemed to take no time to arrive and tasted creamy with a great range of flavours
all the meat which they use is of the highest quality and you can definitely taste the difference in all their meat dishes
we all spent no more than each
including drinks
rice and tips
and we'll hopefully be back sometime soon
my flatmates and i have tried various indian takeaways but we always seem to back to the guru because their food is simply amazing
balti as_good_as_it_gets
and the naan breads are giant
it may not be the cheapest place for a takeaway but totally worth_every_penny
i have not eaten in the restaurant so cannot comment on the service
we've been to the guru a few times but since it's new refurbishment i can only say things have only got better
the food has always been great here as the other reviewers remark but it kind of lacked on the decor before
i was pleasantly_surprised on our latest visit
a clean fresh modern look brings it bang up to date and the atmosphere is great
we went on a friday_night and managed to get a table but had to wait for a while before one was available so best to book in advance
i had a mixed kebab to start which was really tasty
you could taste the barbecue flavour from the clay_oven
the waiter recommended the guru special sauce instead of the regular sauce and it was amazing
although not for the faint of heart as it is really spicy but added another dimension of flavour to the dish
i went for a chicken karahi main and we shared a garlic_naan together
if you want authentic naan_bread this is the only place in edinburgh i've been too that serve naan just like india
i mean they are massive but they are thin perfectly_cooked without the normal doughy bits you get in other places
the karahi was excellent although way too much for me
service is great
relaxed and friendly just the way i like it
if you want indian in edinburgh goto the guru
i am of indian heritage myself so for me this place serves the best authentic indian in edinburgh
i have been to the guru balti a few times
over several years
it can be summed up as offering good quality meat and above_average curry
though the hotter dishes tend to lack that real zing of back end heat
they have some of the best and biggest naan_bread though their rice doesn't particularly stand out
the restaurant tends to be fairly quiet through the week
making it a good choice for post cinema eating if you happen to be at the nearby cineworld
guru is a good choice for an indian meal and if you live in the area it should probably be your indian restaurant of choice
when i lived in a flat off gilmore place the bombay bicycle club was my go to indian takeaway
so popular was it with my flatmates and i that for a while i would receive text messages on the way home that only read
'bombay
'
weirdly the delivery man would always arrive to the door in a full suit which made_us_feel especially guilty for slobbing out with a takeaway in our pj's
no_matter_what time of day we ordered it always took them at least minutes to arrive although it was always worth it
byriani
sagg and red fort were our standard orders although the dupiaza was also pretty good
three curries between four was easily enough in fact
by the time we got through the bread and rice we often had too much
even though the restaurant has had a recent revamp i would still find it a bit odd to eat in here
the seats all seem to be pressed against the windows and i'd feel as though the whole street was watching me
i've heard good things about the service but if i was going out for curry i'd probably wander down the road to gandhi's instead
great for delivery but awkward to sit in
i'm not really masterfully adept at recognising a good indian
my weak british mouth can't_handle the chilli and often leaves an unshakeable burning sensation for the rest my meal
ultimately ensuring i can't make head or foot of what i'm eating
deciding to man up and re kindle my indian food knowledge i opted for the bbc's kashmiri curry with a liberal dose of cobra beer
much to my surprise i found i could recognise each flavour rather than sweating the spices away and subsequently had an enjoyable meal
reasonably_priced and with a cool name
i'll be back again
this great little indian restaurant is located in the tollcross area of the city
like sam
i have a palette that prefers non spicy food
so i ordered a mild curry when i visited here for a friend's leaving meal
it wasn't at all busy on the night i visited
the waiters were vigilant
and it did almost feel like we were being watched as we sat and ate the meal
the food was very tasty though
and appeared swiftly after ordering
this was no doubt helped by the fact that there weren't many customers
this place didn't bowl me over like kismot
but it was still a good night out with some tasty food
i would like to go back some time
and i suggest you bear it in mind as a place worth visiting
i had the spiciest_curry ever in bombay bicycle club for lunch one day and i don't think my tongue has ever recovered
this restaurant serves authentic indian_cuisine and there is a really lovely and homely feel to the inside
situated in the tollcross area of edinburgh
bombay bicycle club is just a short walk from the city centre and so it is a convenient place to reach
their lunch menu is truly awesome
and they offer a wide range of indian dishes
i had the onion_bhaji to start which was very tasty followed by chicken with a chili and garlic curry_sauce
they give little warnings next to each dish stating whether the meal is mild or hot which is handy
but i paid no attention to it and went charging in and ordered a 'hot' dish and boy was it hot
the curry was really delicious and full_of_flavour
but my tongue had gone pretty numb after a while from the heat and so i couldn't taste much
i feel i should just warn you that extreme caution ought to be paid to the menu when you are choosing your meal and the next time i go here i will definitely play it safe and order a mild curry
bombay bicycle club serve tandoori and biryani dishes
as well as the more traditional curry's such as madras
there is also a good selection of vegetarian_dishes on offer
takeaways are also available here and they offer a free home delivery service amazing
bombay bicycle club is a fantastic curry_house and one i will definitely_be_going_back to
so i am a notorious curry fiend
it's all i want to eat
all day long
and i just can't get enough
all my friends have learnt not to get in the way of me and my curry
luckily edinburgh has curry_houses a plenty to help me get my fix
so many in fact that it's easy to get overwhelmed and just order from your closest restaurant time and time again
well
if your closest restaurant is not bombay bicycle club and you haven't yet given it a go
you must promise me you will
i spent a month this summer in india giving in to all my curry cravings
and when my friends wanted to go for an indian days after i was back in edinburgh
i was really nervous about whether i'd enjoy it
or whether comparisons with the mother land would leave me in tears
the bbc was incredible authentic
full of traditional spices and serious about its menu
i ordered the marco polo chicken from the chef's recommendations section of the menu
not a traditional curry name i know
but wait til you eat you just won't care
it was rich
well spiced
tangy and saucy
with beautifully marinated chicken strips which were huge
all of my friends were similarly impressed with what they ordered so much so no one offered anyone else a taste
being so happy and protective of their own
the restaurant itself is bright and light
and the service was fine
nothing to rave about
but the food most certainly is
it's not the cheapest curry on the block
with traditional curries being at least for chicken and the chef's specials
but the taste and ingredients are definitely worth splashing out for
we visited bombay bicycle club last week
as a year anniversary hurrah
following up with some good old fringe fun
i've passed this place so many times but never managed to make it in
as most of my stories start
i swear
when i say this
i mean it it's been a good years
i am not entirely convinced it was worth it
i started with vegetable_samosas that looked like they came out of costco pretty forgettable
the boy's prawn puri looked much more
and tasted
much better than my option it's normally my staple
so i was pretty envious as i looked at my sad samosas
for the main
the boy went for the marco polo chicken which he devoured happily
and i had the tandoori trout
lovely seasoning on the trout
but cooked a little too dry
we also shared the afghan chickpeas
which were pretty delicious as an accompaniment
naan was too dry and toasted
now
i've given it two stars
for why
well
food wise
while the main was pleasant
the starter i had was just
eh
i need to find a better word for eh
but at the moment
that's all i can come up with
the mains were pleasant
but in terms of comparing to another restaurant
it isn't food that stands_out as memorable
or particular adept at handling the flavours that can be oh so amazing or delivered with a blunt hammer
so it would be a star for that
i drop down to two because i thought the service was pretty lame
very disinterested
and when you are trying to call the waiter back because he's wandered off halfway through taking your order
that isn't a sign of good service
really
if you think that is
then we need to have a conversation
and doesn't inspire the whole tipping thang
y'know
i'm at a loss for all the praise
as i didn't really experience something that blew my mind
more something that was more mundane than we would have liked
very good food here
living in naples
we don't get that many varieties
so we're happy to travel anywhere and branch outside italian cuisine
this made us happy
it was crowded on a saturday
but they fit us into a snug spot
only flaw was that our appetizer came out a little cold on the inside
never a good sign
they were apologetic and gave_us a second with another free appetizer
the entrees of curry
masala
and tandoori were all excellent
we ordered takeaway from bbc this evening
i had great difficulty ordering on the phone
and the order arrived a bit wrong
i rang them up expecting them to jump to fix it
firstly they just said sorry
and left it at that i had to ask what they were going to do to fix it expecting either off the next order
a refund of the items i didn't want wihtout the accompaniment
or them to send the stuff straight round
we live a min drive from the place
instead they told me i was now at the back of the queue for delivery
when they should have fixed the mistake first
and would have to wait minutes for my missing items
the item was mango_chutney for poppadoms and i didn't want them without it
i also wanted them before the curry so i asked for a refund instead
the guy seemed annoyed
but said fine
he then rang up after to say they wanted the poppadoms back when i got my refund
so back they went
the already touched
already out of the bag poppadoms
i really hope someone notices that before they try and eat them
a takeaway meal for with average curry ruined by a bad telephone manner
bad customer_service
and the thought
thethought
that they have re served poppadoms to people
shudder
ps try pataka on causewayside or kismot on st leonards street
much nicer service
same price range
visited may
if you're wanting a relatively cheap and satisfying indian take away meal
clerk street is the place to go
however
roti restaurant is in whole other league
it's a successful attempt at fusing quality scottish ingredients with indian recipes
the menu has the usual dishes you would expect at an indian restaurant
but if you take a closer look you'll see they've tried to make them more unique
also what i call trying to justify the prices
for example it's possible to have haggis samosas
salmon filled naan
defininitely a first
and for dessert indian carrot cake
the main_dish menu is a little bit more traditional and doesn't stray too much from curries
the tiffin for a tenner option seems pretty cool
it's basically tins filled with different foods
and there are vegetarian
meat and fish options
the decor is quite fancy and contemporary
making it nice for a special night out
as a student living alone
i get take aways regularly
then i get annoyed because my bum isn't getting any smaller
probably something to do with the take aways that i don't stop_eating until a
it's finished and b
i feel sick
but noor seem to have the solution
their portions are quite small perfect for one person
when i first got food from here
chicken_korma
really creamy and delicious
i was kind of disappointed by what seemed like little amount of food i was given
but turns_out it was perfect
they have a really extensive_menu
it all looks delicious
i'm a spice pussy though
so i don't tend to go for the spice
but i'm told it's really good too
they deliver too
which is great
they are even part of just eat
co
uk so you don't even have to pick_up the phone
order online
i really like noor
the food at noor is pretty great and as already explained by emily t
the portions are perfect for if you want a guilt free pig out of delicious indian food in a one person banquet
anyway
the food here is great if a little over priced in my opinion
especially in comparison to other indian take aways in the area
dont write it off yet though while other places are cheaper
they lack the authenticity and generaly very hight quality food that noor offers
choose wisely
noor is totally deserving of my first star_review
and you'll now see why
whenever i want an indian takeaway
there is only one word on my lips noor
for the past few years
it has stood_out for me as a purveyor of some of edinburgh's finest takeaway food
i totally agree with what jonathan said
there are cheaper places
but they don't quite measure up
all of the food i have ordered from noor has been top_notch
i tend to go for the less spicy end of the spectrum
so stick with kormas and bhunas
occasionally stepping up to a tikka masala or rogan_josh
all of the food has been tasty and flavoursome
something which can be lacking in some takeaways
the menu has a good variety
and the online ordering service means that you don't even have to leave the comfort of your sofa
delivery has always been on time
and the food has been piping_hot
it's so difficult to communicate the warm feeling that noor gives in my stomach
before eating
even the mention of a noor curry starts the saliva production
i command everyone to enjoy the awesomeness that is noor
noor is definitely up there as one of my favourite takeaways
they serve really traditional and authentic indian dishes which are of excellent quality
noor's menu has a vast selection of fine indian food which are very well priced at around six pounds for a main meal and you can see the chef's preparing your meal in the back
i love their chicken_tikka buhna which is full_of_flavour and spices
they also have met menu's available which include starters
a main and rice for just under seven pounds per_person
they also have a wide_variety of vegetarian meals which are priced at under five pounds for a main_course
noor offer a home delivery service which i have always found to be extremely efficient and you can order either on line
by phone
text or by popping into the shop itself
the food is cooked fresh on the premises and it only takes about minutes after ordering for your food to be ready
they are open until midnight seven days a week so it is great place to stop buy for decent meal on your way back from a night out
noor is an excellent indian takeaway which offers quick
friendly service and excellent food
i've eaten from here twice with my flatmates and on both occassions we were far from disappointed
the menu_is_extensive with a huge range of authentic indian dishes taken from all over the country
i had the lamb_rogan_josh the first time and it was amazing with a delicious blend of flavours and a good amount of heat running through it
the portion_size wasn't huge
but certainly hit_the_spot
we delivered the second time and i went for the tandoori_chicken kebabs which were seriously spicy
yet also tender
the delivery time was almost negligible it was so fast and the whole meal between four of us came to under
i'd definitely recommend noor if you're in the area
you simply cannot beat noor indian takeaway
the food is delicious enough to make you rejoice for being human and having the ability to appreciate such things
noor is located just a few doors down the road from my flat
and as such
i have quickly become a regular
my friends and i always get the set meals
which include a choice of
golden oldies
curries
all the classics such as korma
rogan_josh
dopiaza
madras
bhuna and
my personal favourite
dhansak
along with rice or naan
five vegetable_pakoras along with some salad and sauces
what more could you want
all for six to seven pounds per_person
depending_on how many of you there are
the absolute beauty of noor is that the food tastes great and the portions are very generous
one portion of curry usually lasts me for my tea that night as well as a very satisfying lunch_the_next_day
as it provides at least two meals
it certainly offers great value_for_money
the pakoras are wonderfully crispy also
and for an extra you can order a bag of ten that are worth_every_penny
due to my close vicinity
i have always collected my orders in person and i have never been kept waiting for than minutes
if you prefer it to be delivered to your door
they will do so for only
although i cannot comment on the speed of delivery
overall
if it's an indian you're after
look no further
you have found something heavenly
noor was my indian of choice for the first two years of my uni life
and while now i will occasionally stray from it
i'll always end up crawling back
the curries are huge
well cooked and really cheap
although they are arguably not as sophisticated as many other curry_houses
they still make a mean dopiaza and friends
found on nicholson street it clearly caters to students and the prices reflect this
you can get a meal deal with a curry and rice or nan for
and one will more than fill all but but the fattest of fatties
as well as this they and a la_carte menu
with all the normal curries and a few specialities
the sauces are great
really creamy and rich without being over the top
all the traditional curries are done exceptionally
and whilst i am yet to sample their specialities i look_forward to it
they also do all the sides you could want
with a variety of nan breads
and pakoras
bhajis
samosas etc for vvery reasonable_prices
the staff are really nice
and the service is very quick
combine this with excellent food and that's a winner in my book
me and my mate ordered from noor takeaway last firday
i was advised from a couple of friends that it was a great place to go to and the reviews on here looked great too so i though that i would go for it
we ordered online
where we were able to choose the time for which we wanted it to be delivered and they were on time which was a good start
i ordered a chicken ceylon
which i had never had before and tasted a spicy korma
the only criticism of it that i could find was that there wasn't enough chicken although it was lovely and tender
the portions that you get are great and me and my friend couldn't finish it all so we put what we couldn't finish into the fridge and ate it the next day
we also ordered papadums and naans
and both were delicious
this is definitely one of the best curry restaurants_in_edinburgh and the prices_are_pretty reasonable too
just discovered_this_place
extraordinarily good food and very friendly_staff
even though it is a take away
we sat at one of the tables and enjoyed our curries
highly_recommend
though named takeaway
there are three tables inside to eat at as well
we tried the set meal for two and were very happy with the choices all of the items were very tasty and fresh
the only
complaint
we could have is that it was simply way too much food
very friendly_staff and great food
my new favorite takeaway
we've lived on the the southside of edinburgh for nearly two years and somehow had overlooked noor
our loss
noor provides an outstanding product
with good customer_service
at very reasonable_prices
saag_paneer is my very fave curry
so that's how i judge most indian places
their's is superb just spicy enough and the spinach not pureed
great pakora and naan
the chicken_korma is very mild
working our way through the menu
on the last visit i had placed a large order that was not ready when i arrived to collect it
a tech glitch had prevented the order from being uploaded and i had to wait about minutes
without asking
was deducted from the total and a litre of coke added
very thoughtful
i love noor
the chicken shajani is the best curry i have ever had and i used to go in there at least once per week
unfortunately
i am no longer in edinburgh so i can not get my noor fix
i have been searching for something even half as good as their shajani but i've not been successful in my search so far
i kind of wish i had never found this place but i guess it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved
or something like that
the portion_sizes are good
the staff are friendly and the food is really tasty
noor is a quality takeaway with a small eating area
tables
and a kitchen you can see while waiting for your food
the curries are fresh
the nan light and the pakoras and samosas are crisp and delicious
basically exactly what you want in indian food
the staff are friendly and happy to serve the food at the tables
if you want to sit in and the food itself is great
so if you are in the area give it a try
this is now my favourite take away and has overtaken the mighty kasbah for me
i left this a while before reviewing as i often ended_up in here on the wrong side of a night out and everything is great when you are half cut
food goggles i guess ha
d
anyway fast forward a few months and i have popped in here a half dozen times or so and the food is consistently amazing
the staff are really fiendly and the delivery service is quick
the restaurants decor is functional and the seating_area is quite comfy with some leather sofas or an area to sit in and dine
often while waiting we recieve complimentary poppadoms and pickles while we wait
there are a few stand out curries on the menu for me from what i have tried sabzi chilli dal
hurri mirchi vegetables and the vegetable persian were great and get reordered each time we go
the veg pakoras are worth a mention in that they are great quality and there are loads of them
also served in a brown paper bag
first time i had pakora it was presented this way so in my head its how they should be served
lastly try the roti boti
tandoori_chicken wrapped in roti bread
these are amazing
noor is a great option if you are after some tasty indian food
i ordered the set meal for two
the lamb dishes were both well cooked
nicely spiced and very tasty
the amount of food which arrived was more than advertised
myself and my flatmate struggled to finish it
which is unusual for us
noor is in my opinion
the best indian take away ever
i was a regular here when i was in edinburgh first for the good price but they i realised how delicious the food was
i always recommend it to friends travelling through as well
the portions and amount of condiments are generous and the ceylon curry is my absolute favourite
i eat here every time i'm back in edinburgh and always find it just as amazing as before
i don't often give stars
however noor has earned them
this is my go to takeaway when it comes to curry
the only better curry is from kismot
which is a restaurant
imo
not only is it great curry
it is great value as the portions
particularly with the set meal
are large
i have worked my way through half the menu and am yet to find a curry which isn't fresh and tasty
i have even bought the set meal for two occasionally
so i can eat curry for two days as the food easily tastes as good re heated the next day
the chicken madras
vindaloo or hurri mirchi are my favourites however this is one of the few places i have enjoyed the milder creamier curries from
in short if you fancy an indian takeaway then noor is highly_recommended
the food was tasty and good
we had the lamb_rogan_josh
highly_recommended
and the chicken madras with ginger naan
the only place i've found making this variety of naan
with onion_bhaji
papadom and pilau_rice
service was fast
portions were big
the meal was meant for two but we were so full after a while that we kept the rest for breakfast the next day
if you're craving good indian food where portions are generous and prices are okay
this is the place to go
if i didnt have tummy issues after eating here it would easily be a star
but the fact that i do get tummy issues but still keep_coming_back means that maybe it is star food
its cheapness makes it seem that much tastier
i will stick with a star only cause there is no indoor seating
you can sit outside at long picnic tables outside
under a tent thingy or just get takeaway
its good
and you get a lot of it
there are brave people eating here in the winter but i am not one of them
they change their menu every day
you walk in to a small room
wait in a usually short line
pick out any number of their around options differing daily that are looking at you so you can see whats up even if you dont know whats in it
wait for it
get it takeway or join some randoms and inhale
i hate to use the word authentic
cause i dont give a shit if something is authentic
if i like it i like it
but if you are one of those people who likes to only eat authentic
ive been told this is authentic as authentic can get
my brother lived in edinburgh for several years and took me here when i came to visit for a few days
i love a lot of things in edinburgh but this was definitely top three stops
enormous
delicious plate of vegetarian food for less than i paid for any other meal on the trip
eating it out back at the picnic tables on a lovely day was tops
a friend took me here for a cheap dinner when i visited him a few years_ago
i think we went back at least twice more in the week i was there
we would have probably gone every day if we hadn't been restrained only by our mutual guilt at eating there so often
the curry is absolutely fantastic
cheap
and lavishly portioned
that plus a little cheap tesco naan
i'm sure their own naan is better
but we were cheap bastards
made for a delicious and filling meal
the ambiance is a bit lacking
so just order for takeaway and enjoy it elsewhere
be sure to hold it with both hands
if it weren't
miles away from me
this would probably be a weekly meal
tucked_away down a subtle side street entrance
the mosque_kitchen is a hidden haven for hearty indian_cuisine
serving locals
students and even the business elite
the luring smell of home_cooked
honest indian_fare attracts all
offering a limited but exceptionally affordable array of dishes
the mosque_kitchen produces some simple but flavoursome gems
vegetarians can enjoy a truly moreish tarka dahl or a flavoursome spinach and potato curry
whilst those of a more meaty persuasion can indulge in one of the mosque's daily chicken or lamb servings
with the offering of rice
plain or garlic_naan to accompany each dish
diners can anticipate a meal that satisfies any level of hunger
a word of warning
though
diners can expect to feast on humble trestle tables
shelter under a rustic corrugated roof and mingle amidst a friendly bunch of pigeons
meek and unassuming
the mosque_kitchen boasts unbeatable prices
food of a superlative nature
and will undoubtedly leave you comfortably stuffed for the day ahead
there are few places anywhere that you will find a curry for
but right here at the mosque_kitchen you can eat your heart out for next to nothing
i love the canteen feel
the outdoor picnic table seating
the paper_plates and the plastic spoons
it doesn't have to please aesthetically just to pull in the punters the people of edinburgh know a good curry when they eat it and this is why the mosque_kitchen is so popular
absolutely great with a big bunch of friends on a summers evening
brilliant if you're skint or if you just can't be bothered cooking as the generous portions will fill you up no problems
it's also the kind of place you could just go and sit on your own tucking into some curry and doing a spot of people watching
little independent places like this are great and i highly_recommend visiting
the vegetable_curry is my favourite
it's nice and spicy just the way i like it
brilliant
a no frills eating venue which has begun to take on an almost legendary status
the mosque_kitchen is a dining_experience quite unlike any other in the city
if it's luxury
ambience
or even proper cutlery you're after
you won't find it here
if however it's a tasty curry at frankly unbelievably cheap prices you want
then that's exactly what you'll get
i'm so carnivorous i'd happily feast on a roadkill rabbit by the side of the motorway
so i was pretty surprised to find it was the vegetable_curry
with all sorts of greenery thrown in
that was my favourite
i expect i'll be a regular visitor here though
so that may change
it's places like this that really give a city it's character
and i'd much rather give my hard earned to the people of the mosque than many of the city's more unscrupulous curry_house owners
i urge you to do the same
if you only have
in your pocket and want a meal that's a
tasty and b
enormous
preferably with a bit of 'character' thrown in
this is where you should head
by 'character'
i mean you sit outside under a gazebo in the backyard of edinburgh central mosque
and you eat out of a polystyrene box with a plastic fork
but the food is that good that you won't care about the pigeon eyeing up our lunch feet away
i usually go for the veggie option
because the one time i did get the chicken there were quite a lot of fatty chewy bits
in fact
it made me stay_away_from here for a while
but then a veggie friend convinced me to get the lentil and spinach curry instead
and years later i'm still eating there
it's right by the uni
but you get a surprsing mix of people thanks to it's word of mouth reputation
if you haven't tried it yet
then you need to
soon
i cant believe i lived across the road from this place for nearly a whole year and didnt try the mosque_kitchen
it was recommended to me
and frankly i didnt fancy it but i was there today and i am now kicking myself that i didnt take advantage while i still could
the food is great
it's propper indian pakistani food
and more importantly there is absolutly loads of it for a very tidy price
eating outdoors is also great
and gives this place a great vibe
i really will be here again
this place should definitely be kept on the down low because it is frickin awesome
i really fancied curry the other day and remembered seeing the raving reviews_on_yelp and thought i would give it a bash
the simplicity of this restaurant might put you off at first but it is fantastic
real
authentic food and at a stupidly cheap price
never has eating out a box been so good
i will return to this place again and again because it is just that good
in the scotsman newspaper placed the mosque_kitchen top of its list of best festival food and it's clear to see why
their curries are authentic
slow cooked
flavoursome and sold in generous portions
i have been twice
both times having the chicken curry with rice and a naan_bread which was tasty and filling
to order your food you simply walk past the eating area and into a small room where you order your curry canteen style and then eat it off a plastic plate
for vegetarians there are a variety of vegetable curries and these
along with the meat and poultry ones
are all served with rice for less than
the service is friendly and effective and i like the eating arrangement where you take your food outside and eat it under the plastic roof while chatting with your mates
the mosque_kitchen offers genuine value_for_money and is visited each day by people from a huge range of ethnic and national backgrounds and for good reason too
nearly every student has heard of the mosque_kitchen
there is a reason for that
situated near george sq in the centre of town
the mosque_kitchen is a canteen esque restaraunt attached to the edinburgh mosque
this where students come to fill up with big portions of cheap curry
don't be put off though
cheap does not mean poor quality
the mosque_kitchen serves a small range of curry every day
there is usually a small selection
that can be accompanied with rice with some side servings such as nan
food is dished up into polystyrene dishes and eaten with plastic cutlery
but make no mistake
the curry is great quality and the portions very reasonable
regular attendees appreciate the lack of fuss made over the presentation
they are here for what the kitchen sets out to do
provide great curry for all
the mosque_kitchen has a communal feel and expects to have some great chat
especially if you come regularly
sitting at one of the few long
school cafeteria type tables
if you're visiting edinburgh and you want to see where the locals
especially the students
eat out
or you are looking for somewhere less pricey to fill up for the day
try the mosque_kitchen
if you live in edinburgh and you haven't been
why not
this place is brilliant
nothing more to say
well
ok i'll go on
it doesn't_look_like much to people walking past and you'll not be the first to walk past it
but if you go in you'll never want to go anywhere_else
the offer huge dishes for next to nothing
the food is delicious and the people there are beyond wonderful
it feels like you're getting a cuddle every time you're in here
it's a total diamond in the rough
only tell your best friends
the mosque_kitchen is a great addition to the curry scene in edinburgh
unlike many traditional curry_houses that serve bland
mass produced masalas etc
the mosque_kitchen has traditional muslim food that
i have been assured by my arabic friends
is what they do eat
the place itself is beautifully grubby
you go into a little kitchen
queue up like in a school canteen then head off outside onto plastic chairs and tables all under a big gazebo
there is nothing refined about the location
the kitchen relies on its food
and the food is really
really good
there are only curries
chicken and lamb
and while the lamb can be quite stringy
the chicken is always excellent
think a korma but less sauce and much more subtly spiced
they also do daal
some form of spinach dish and other dishes i don't recognise as well as kofta kebabs
the rice is absolutely_amazing
and the nan breads are huge
although the price has gone up a wee bit recently
the mosque_kitchen is still the cheapest curry place around
with a curry with rice or nan costing only
and the other dishes less
the guys who work there are really friendly
and it is a great establishment to give your money to
the mosque_kitchen lies just behind edinburgh central mosque and offers food at unbeatable prices where the money you pay goes to worthy causes
i have been here a good few times
and i must say that the last time i went
i was a bit disappointed by the naan_bread
and thought it was a bit dry
but it is the festival period and i came late in the day
so perhaps this may have had something to do with it
even if this was a common occurrence
i would probably still give this place stars
as the curry tastes divine and the portions will fill you up no matter how hungry you are
if you do not want to fork out on extra money on drinks there is a water fountain just outside the kitchen area and there are cups where you can have this water instead
a couple of very minor criticisms of the place is that there are lots of pigeons who pester you during your meal while you sit under the gazebo and they only supply a spoon rather than a knife and fork
other than this
it's great
there aren't many places in edinburgh that can be this
this is the best
place
in
edinburgh
ever
i have friends who come back to visit and refuse to leave without stopping at the mosque_kitchen first
i'm not talking_about people who'd never been here before
though
word does get around
but people who lived in edinburgh for a while and counted on the mosque_kitchen to cure their disproportionate hangover
i always get the vegetarian_options
which have multiplied lately
which are dahl
rice
greasy spinach with potatoes
chickpeas
and sometimes a vegetable_curry
and i think they're definitely the best and cheapest options available
the mosque_kitchen also sells rubicon and delicious ginger beer to quench your thirst
the people who work there are also real sweet too
do i really feel this place needs another star_review
no i do not
do i think that there's anything i can say that hasn't already been said
no i do not
chaise lounge monkey fist
i stand corrected
ok
so this probably isn't news by now
but listen
they give you a lot of food for not a lot of cashmoney
you've heard that before
right
will get you tarka dal
lentils
and rice
sheesh kebabs and rice or a few other options that escape me right now
i have likely been there about or times by now
because you_can't_beat the price
and you_can't_beat the portions
fantastic
delicious
well portioned
fast
inexpensive food
served in the back of a mosque
for a wonderful steaming chicken curry dish that will fill you up
unlike so many places around here
the garlic_nan bread is also delicious
except i'm usually too full to eat it
the only downside to this amazing place is that the seating is outdoors under a tarp
so if it's a windy and cold day you should either bundle up or get it to take away and eat it somewhere warmer
it was okay
for curry
rice
veggies and a drink isn't bad
it's just not the most aesthetically pleasing restaurant
as has been said
you're sitting outside under a tarp on cafeteria style benches
floodlit and surrounded by mossy walls
they have three choices of curry
vegetarian
chicken
or
meat
this concerned me greatly as to what the chicken was if not meat
but i digress
anyway
i was after the
meat
but they sold out so i went for the chicken
i'm not sure what part of the chicken they used but it seemed very fatty
pretty tasty though
and for the asking price
still pretty good
had another funny conversation with the guy behind_the_counter after the
meat
no meat
chicken
conversation
i asked if he had any garlic_naan
he looks at me and goes
naan
pause none
have to get in earlier next time i guess
went to the mosque_kitchen for the first time after a year away travelling
i have to say it was one of the two things i missed while i was away
kopperberg was the other
and i was worried it might have changed
maybe the prices had gone up
maybe they don't do lamb anymore
maybe the pigeons had killed everyone in a fit of impulsive hunger and taken over the little yard behind the mosque
making it a death trap for the students and locals of newington
thankfully none of the above had in fact happened
although
inevitably
there was one niggling negative upon my return
and that was the great big 'mosque kitchen' sign over the archway
this kitchen is edinburgh's best kept secret and should really stay that way if we want to enjoy the portions
the price and the level of service from the lovely folk that run the place
same thing happened to kfc and that place is extortionate now
okay i can't back that up
other than that
i got the ground minced lamb rather than the big chunky lamb
bit of a surprise but still great
chicken's still the chicken
winner
love_this_place
first found out about it through a muslim friend last year and was so happy that day
for you get to fill your tummy with delicious spicy goodness and a nice cool beverage to wash it all down
very good price for the amount of food you get
it's nothing fancy
just a kitchen with an eating area outside covered by tarp
i don't really care about fancy restaurants or anything
so i was perfectly happy to eat outside
as far as i'm concerned
as long as we're not getting rained on
it's all good
great food
great value_for_money
and i recommend them to anyone looking for tasty and tongue tingling food at a competitive price
good for a bowl of tasty hot
cheap
quick vegetarian food
don't go expecting a restaurant
i enjoyed my curry and rice
hmph
i think i was expecting much more from mosque_kitchen than what was delivered
saag aloo that had been cooked to death
somehow the potato remained semi raw
cold chicken and average tarka daal
massive portions yes
perfect for starving students looking for a change from greggs
but for a couple of quid more
you can get a lot better
definitely disappointed in this one
i can't believe i have been yelping for a year and still haven't reviewed the mosque_kitchen
ok here it goes
hungover
like cheap curry
in a hurry
then mosque_kitchen is for you
i really enjoy mosque_kitchen when it isn't freezing outside
it's outdoor seating although i hear they made an indoor seating
nevertheless
be it sun or snow this food will most certainly warm you up from the inside
a great choice for some affordable grub at very substantial portions
you can mix and match the mains if you can't decide on a specific curry
their garlic_naan is particularly tasty also
be warned that lunch times can be very busy as well as swooping pigeons
great food at great value
great for students
or tourists on a budget
huge helping for lunch or dinner for only
i got the chicken curry
with rice and a samosa
extra
and it was such a big helping that even i couldn't finish it
says a lot
the only complaint i have about the mosque is that when i went they weren't serving drinks anymore
i mean like water
juice
it was closed
my friend ended_up going to ask specifically and got herself a bottle of water
but it seemed kinda overpriced
definitely if you're on a budget
this is a great place to go good value for your dollar
and a huge
and delicious
helping
having been recently introduced to the mosque kitchen's new indoor restaurant
i've been a bit of a glutton and visited three times in the last month or two
i really love_this_place
the food is cheap
filling and incredibly tasty
the menu is quite limited
but what it lacks in variety it more than makes up in the yum stakes
there's enough on offer for meat_eaters and veggies alike to be satisfied
you can get a large plate of lentil dhal and rice for and a freshly_made nan_bread for
other things on offer include a spinach dish
vegetable_curry
lamb_curry and chicken curry
as well as garlic nans
samosas and a few other bits and pieces
portion_sizes are large and very enjoyable a bit of a rarity in edinburgh these days
don't expect airs and graces
the place is canteen style and you'll be eating your grub off paper_plates with plastic cutlery
the decor is clean and contemporary
with long tables happily accommodating ten people or more
the food is served buffet style and the service is quick but a little abrupt
i was told that the mosque kitchen's profits go towards funding the mosque and that the staff are volunteers
so i'm not surprised that the service can sometimes be a little lacking in finesse
that's the only reason i'm not giving it stars
if you want something sweet to round off your meal
cakes and pastries are available starting at around
brilliant value_for_money
fab food and a nice_atmosphere make for a great bit of budget dining in the city
this place along with their newly established mosque cafe on clerk nicholson st way
is good quality food for a great price
however
i wish they would use true cutlery and plates instead of the styrofoam they still use in the cafe
it just doesn't suit the establishment and isn't friendly all around
the newer cafe is cleaner than the mosque environs where you had to eat outdoors under a covered area with pigeons flying about
overall
it is great for the food
cheap and cheerful indian food
much paper plate and plastic fork charm
we summed it up as
an unmissable edinburgh lunch spot that represents excellent bang for your buck
if you've not been there
go
and if you haven't been for a while
go back and sample it again
you_won't_be_disappointed
came here a_few_weeks_ago with friends and enjoyed the food but the place was absolutely packed
i guess that's what you get for coming around lunch time near uni
the food was good and the price was definitely nice
you get huge portions
i did feel that my dish was a little too oily buttery though and considering there is indian food on nearly every corner in edinburgh
i wasn't too impressed with it
perfect for students on a budget though
this place was awesome
it's about as hole_in_the_wall as it gets
the food is awesome and entirely authentic
i miss it already
if you ever get the chance
go for it
if you want the extra burn
grab a ginger beer to complement the curry
the mosque_kitchen is a very simple and clean indian place with a menu that won't put a dent in your wallet
the chicken curry is outstanding and some of the most tender curry chicken i've_ever_eaten
the vegetable
chickpea
curry was just as delicious
a huge plate of curry over rice for is pretty amazing
they have an buffet portion after pm
but i found a single portion to be adequate
the only letdown was the lamb_curry
which wasn't nearly as tender
for what it is the new mosque_kitchen
is simply phenomenal
if you don't like curry
don't come here
if you want fancy cutlery
don't come here
if want porcelain or china plates
don't come here
if you want table service
don't come here
if you need booze with your food
don't come here
if you want to eat a really tasty meal
which will leave you feeling full
but not bloated
for hours after come here
if you want to eat well for pennies
come here
if you want to eat cheaply in a family friendly canteen style eatery come here
the address here is right
but pictures are of the old mosque_kitchen
went with the chicken and beef curry with rice
not a bad dish by any standards
the only downside was we had too much leftover and our fridge in the rv was not working
not bad really
just meant back to back meals of great food
i thought that the prices were very good and the food was not the best
but better than most
buffet style
indian_restaurants
if i lived here
i would_definitely_come_back from time to time
this restaurant firmly deserves his reputation for good food
immediately you notice many people in traditional muslim dress
that's an excellent sign
everything is so clean here too
my friend and i got the buffet
this was mainly do not knowing what specifically to order and wanting to sample too much
anyway
the food is great
there is so much to choose from
i especially liked the pakora
rice
naan
and sheekh kebabs
those kebabs were bloody spicy
if you're doing the buffet
you'll pay and get your plate at the main counter
if you're purchasing items off their menu
you can pay where the food is being served
they only accept cash
i'd heard so many good things about the mosque_kitchen but had never been myself
i decided to go for lunch and just fell in love with the concept
they serve lunch from
am until pm then offer an all_you_can_eat buffet until pm
please note though that on fridays they are closed before
pm for prayer
basically
there is no waiting about here so it is the perfect place to go during your lunch hour at work if you want great quality food fast
plus
the prices aren't far off what you pay for a sandwich so it really is a winner
there is no table service so you go up to the hot plate at the back of the restaurant and pick what you'd like to eat
all the meals are already prepared and just waiting for the taking
i had sheekh kebabs with rice
and my companion had chicken curry and rice
we could not even make a dent in our plates as they were heaped so high with food
we thought it'd be rude not to get a nan_bread to accompany the meal though as at they are practically giving themaway
this place doesn't serve alcohol because it is part of the mosque but for all the time you're in there you really don't miss it
with the quality of food so high and prices so low it really does tick all the boxes
great choice for a cheap yet tasty meal
i was originally going to give the mosque a solid but then i had another think about it and i decided i was going to have to reduce this by star
and here is why
pro followed by con
the curry is really tasty but there is more variation in just how tasty it is
today for example i was a bit dissapointed the rice was greasy and the chicken lacked flavour
it's cheap but it's not as cheap as it used to be
the delight was that you could get more food
and a drink faster and cheaper_than anywhere_else
while it's still pretty much faster and more
there is less than you used to get and you're paying almost more than a few years_ago
the location is good
it's central
on that lovely bit of edinburgh old town that seems reserved for mentalists and drug users
however it's close to pretty much all of old town and the uni so this is fine
it's chilled out
the guys are cool
they do takeaway and it's ironically an amazing lunch time hangover cure if you're suffering from the night before
anyway i've mainly given it start because it's not as good as it used to be and it's gotten more expensive
saying that i still eat here a couple times a week
favourite meal
meat curry
rice
dahl and veg
witha can of rubicon guava juice
sweet
there seems to be two restaurants with this name
but the one i went to was not the one under the mosque but it's nearby
corner
since i heard this one has the original chef
i had
chicken pulao with rice
there was no chicken in it
but just this wonderful sauce over rice
even in a styrofoam bowl and eaten with a plastic spoon
it tasted really great
not to add that it was very reasonably_priced at
lots of rice drenched in sauce
the nd time i had it with extra vegetable toppings
peas
carrots
and potatoes for an extra
it wasn't as good though
the chicken curry was even better
very tender chicken
great simple food at fantastic prices
the new mosque_kitchen provides a simple yet basic setting for those seeking an authentic curry in a hurry
the menu is basic but has classic chicken
lamb and vegetarian_options so likely to be somehting to suit everyone and with prices starting at
for tarka dahl with rice to
for chicken curry and rice you definately wont be breaking the bank
the sag aloo was delicious and the garlic_nan is worth_the_wait
if you've not been here before then i'll try and set the scene
dont think of it as a restaurant
there's no menu cards or table service
maybe more of a canteen
there's a menu on the wall and a self service area where you are served food that's ready and waiting
bear in mind that the restaurant belongs to the mosque and so there's no extravagance
it's plastic plates and cutlery however it somehow makes it feel more authentic
as you would expect there's no alcohol available but there is a good range of soft_drinks including traditional lassies
all in all if you like a good curry at fantastic prices then i'd recommend you come here
the mosque_kitchen has been on my internal food radar since about day of moving to edinburgh
when asking for recommendations on where to go
almost everyone told me i simply must try the mosque_kitchen
summed up
it's cheap
it's cheerful
it's no frills
but it's a big plate of food
it's curry and it's tasty
so it was finally over a year later
at pm in the midst of the fringe frenzy that i stumbled upon it with nothing in my but guiness
whisky and an appetite
and for that the middle of a typical fringe day
surrounded by locals
visitors
performers
and pm feeling like pm
i dont know what time this place would close during the festival
but am is a typical hit the hay time
that i lined up in the school cafeteria style queue and ordered my plate of rice
lamb_curry
and paid up front
the lamb was tender
the sauce spicy but that's about as far as it goes
it filled a hole
it was tasty
and it would make do for just those occasions when you're super hungry and just need to fill a hole but want something different to a sandwich hot dog kebab
they mosque_kitchen often do the rounds at festivals too like christmas markets
with their pop up shop
i really like their curry
they're not trying to be a haute cuisine restaurant
so for a time and a place
the mosque_kitchen is perfectly and definitely an edinburgh institution in its own right
ok
so here is the deal
there are two mosque kitchens
a couple of months_ago i ate at the mosque_kitchen that is on the corner of nicholson street and i
was underwhelmed
to say the least
the quality of the food
meh
the cafeteria style setting
meh
no clean tables
meh
didn't like it and couldn't understand for the love of me why people were getting all ravey about it
right
so
get this
if you walk through the front gates of the actual mosque
and walk to the back
there's another mosque_kitchen
where there is table service and the food is positively moarish
it's so good
i'm half suspecting them of just drugging me when i get in there
i get so happy
i have to admit
i now come here about once or twice a week
usually with a colleague
the plates of food you get are just absolutely ridiculous
and the prices are amazingly good
it never fails to keep me full from
well into
which for me is rather important as i get right crabby when i'm hungry
and by crabby i mean
hey lou
have you seen that memo i se
me
grrrrr
colleague
did you just
growl at me
me
kssshhhgrrrrr
ok
so that may not have been the most eloquent explanation
but what i'm trying to get across here is that mosque_kitchen saved my job
and that
my friends
is a good
good thing
this kind of dining is right up my street
unfussy
uncluttered and unassuming
this is how fast_food should be
i will be back
the mosque_kitchen is by far one of the best places to get some of the most succulent kebabs in edinburgh alongside a splash of dall and a dollop of spinach
all over a big full bowl of rice
i would go here at least once or twice a week when i was working at the edinburgh uni library
and would always get a little bit of everything
i was rarely if ever disappointed by the food here
i did make the mistake of going to the new mosque_kitchen they opened up on nicholson
which wasn't too impressive
but was then glad to find out that the original is still alive and well
be warned that this is more of a cafeteria than a restaurant
they will serve you the food inside
and then you go outside to the plastic tables and fold out chairs to enjoy your warm meal
even so
you would still find me here at pm on a cold december night indulging in a big bowl of tasty mosque_kitchen food
anyone who gives this place less than stars needs to take a long
hard look at themselves
this placehas cheap curry
and its like a pot noodle
does exactly what it says on the tin
doesn't try and be posh or anything that its not
just massive portions of tasty cheap curry for under a fiver
dun no
loads of people tell me to come here
and i have come here several times
there are not many options
it is canteen style food
yet the portions are huge
the food is cheap
and this is probably one of the best student meals you will get in the area for the price
especially in terms of quantity
being vegetarian
i have always gone for the chickpea_curry
chana_masala
or the lentil dal with rice
the naan looks decent for the price
plus it's massive
this is a good place to come when you're really hungry and just desperately want to fill up with some food which isn't too bad for you
it's got to be better than kebabs
right
so
this is definitely not a place for a dinner date
nor for a sophisticated ritual for ladies who like to lunch
but it will fill the hole
if i wanted a normal sized portion
i would go to himalaya cafe just up the road and pay around the same price for a delicious curry
yes
it's slightly smaller
but the food is very fresh
tasty
and you get salad with your food
all this in a beautifully decorated cafe
which also offers yoga classes
himalaya also offer an amazing chai latte
which entices me even more
it's cheap and very basic
but has a good variety of curries at very low prices
and the portions are massive so you're probably best asking for take away and finish it off later
no airs and graces
no prevention
i've offend the staff very friendly on both occasions i've been here
it's mass produced food but you know what
there's something refreshing about this place's simplicity
while visiting edinburgh
a friend took us to the mosque_kitchen on our last day in town
as a vegetarian
i thought they had a solid selection for a decent price
the food was tasty and the service was on point
first kitchen i have ever heard of being in or part of a mosque
as its already been pointed_out
reminds me of a cafeteria
stand in line
pick what you want
pay and go back to your seat
has surprisingly good curry
i really enjoyed the spinach lamb_curry
i recommend it
they also have a variety of ethnic beverages to have with your meal
what sold me was the amount of food for the price
it's cheap and left me stuffed
the place also seemed clean when i was there and the staff also friendly
if your tight on money and have a hankering for curry and want a lot of food for cheap this is the place
i ended_up going into this place with some friends
as they said it was pretty good and inexpensive
the actually dining_area isn't anything more then a cafeteria type setting
but there are lots of seats and they can accommodate for larger parties
they have a lot of food places like this in the states
where you basically just go through a line and point to what you want
but this place actually serves decent food
i opted for the vegetarian curries and rice plate
which was pounds for a big plate of rice and curries
i was really keen on the aubergine
but it must be really popular because they were all out
so i opted for the chickpea
mushroom and potato curries
they do have meat
but none of use tried any
i loved the chickpea_curry and the mushrooms as well
but was not a big_fan of the potatoes
the chickpeas were way better then i expected and were really well spiced
overall
the food was quite spicy
but if you can handle it
it is very enjoyable
the only thing
which is a personal thing
is that i like greens in my food
or at least for it to have something green in it
the options i had didn't have any peppers
etc
but i did try my boyfriends okra
which was really nice
so they do offer some good 'green' food options
they provided a good portion of food for the price and all up i think we paid pounds for two meals
a great deal for a cheap and fast eat
i wouldn't go for the ambience
but they also do offer take away if you'd like to sit somewhere without florescent lighting or at home
a nice
quick meal for a reasonable_price
i don't live in the area
but out of the few indian places i've tried in edinburgh
this was the best one
i have been told a few times that this place is an inexpensive gem and for ten pounds i thought why not
the decor is pretty basic although that's to be expected with the low price offer
none of the dishes were labelled
a pretty basic shortcoming for a buffet style restaurant
indeed the first one i've ever been to that you have to make educated guesses on what you're actually eating
secondly the way they were kept
displayed and the lack of fresh replenishments was abysmal
i haven't seen less desirable food in quite some time
after two plates of what i could safely assume was chicken in different and equally horrible guises i'd had my fill although i was in no way full
yes it's ten pounds and it's budget buffet what's your problem i hear you say
i've been to tastier more bountiful buffets for a good four pounds less
i'd rather spend a little bit more cash and go to mother india's cafe or go to flip and have plenty of change in my pocket
this place is great
super cheap and a ton of food
the quality is much better than it should be for how much you pay
if you are a hungry traveler who likes indian food
this is your place
the menu is limited
but the amount of food and tastiness makes this a star
note
this is not the ritz
don't expect a lavish meal
just plain
simple
quick
and good
as a long term patron of madison's indian_restaurants
taste_of_india
maharani
maharaja
and campus biryani
so far
and as a former waitress at an indian restaurant
i'm confident in saying that flavor of india has some of the best north_indian food in the city
its menu is comparable in price and selection to most other indian restaurants_in_madison
however
it has a few things that set it head and shoulders above other locations
decor
service
and a dinner buffet
the walls are painted in rich hues
a welcome pick me up on blustery gray days filled with stinging rain and wind
even the ceiling is decorated in beautiful tapestries
preventing any grating effects of overhead lighting
while still allowing for the space to be bright and cheerful
the service was excellent
prompt
helpful
attentive
and friendly
they even gave my party complimentary papadam with tamarind_sauce and mint and tomato chutneys
the dinner buffet is a rare find in indian_restaurants
and at
it's quite reasonably_priced
it also features a number of dishes not listed on the regular menu
and many are vegetarian
there's also a selection of several desserts
for dinner last_night
my companion and i chose to order samosas
flaky crust and well seasoned contents perfectly accented by the mint_chutney
onion and black pepper kulcha
stuffed with sauteed onions
warm and fluffy
and a shared entree of chicken_tikka_masala
rich
thick medium spicy sauce in a vibrant orange shade
with perfectly_cooked moist chunks of chicken
unlike the sometimes rubbery overdone chicken i've experienced elsewhere
with complimentary rice
par for the course in madison
for drinks
my companion had a mango_lassi
sweet and creamy
with beautiful presentation heretofore only seen at taste_of_india
and i enjoyed a taj_mahal
ounce indian beer
i had to stop my companion from licking the chicken_tikka_masala serving bowl
this was more than enough food for two people
and we could hardly move after dinner
entrees are easily shared between two people
spice_levels are adjusted for midwestern taste_buds
so be sure to stress a high spiciness level if that's your intent
i had an excellent experience at flavor of india last_night
the service was fast and polite
the samosas tasted homemade
the prices were exceedingly reasonable
and the food very tasty
i had the chicken_tikka_masala some of the best i've had ever
my dining companion had the chicken shahikorma
he was swayed by the cashews in cream_sauce
his dish was delicious
but we both agreed that mine was better
the nan was perfect
we were so stuffed from the shared samosas
our entrees
and nan that we had to forgo dessert
i look_forward to returning to flavor of india very soon
i'm well acquainted with every indian restaurant in madison
and this is the best hands_down
i sampled the vegetarian sampler appetizer
two vegetarian entrees
naan and mango_lassi
and everything was excellently prepared
the fried vegetarian appetizer wasn't too greasy and had incredible flavor
the mango_lassi the way it's supposed_to_be
thick and rich
and both the entrees were perfect
flavor of india is a perfect compliment to the capitol square
however a bit hidden
i highly_recommend it
my mom
aunt and i go here pretty much every time we head to madison
we try to vary our orders to make our way through the menu
but the chicken_tikka_masala never fails to be amazing
a_few_weeks_ago we did a take away order and sat at the concert on the square with our dinners
i can't wait until next summer to do it again
i also am dying to get up there during the day to try their_lunch_buffet
the only thing i don't understand is that every time we're there we're usually one of only a few people in the dining_room
madison eaters
go here
wonderful lunch spot
the buffet was about vegetarian
with some unusual offerings like mushrooms and turnips
along with channa_masala
vegetable_pakoras
some potato balls
and vegetable_biryani
all the entrees were tasty and hot
but i wish there was a little more fruit and salad
because one plate of the delicious but oily foods did me in
and i almost always go back for seconds
the chutneys tamarind
mint
and onion were mostly unremarkable
the onion was a little strong
but this was better than any indian food i've had in quite awhile
and i appreciated the abundance of vegetarian_dishes
this place is fantastic
i was a little skeptical at first
i am one who tends to veer away from buffets
but oh so delicious
came in for a saturday lunch and the place seemed to be full of regulars
our waiter sat us
asked if we wanted anything other than water
and pointed to the back of the restaurant
where a buffet is set up against the back wall
there was salad
dessert
chutney
raita
naan
samosas
veggie pakoras
and about kinds of curry
i'm not entirely sure what i tried
i know i got some goat_curry
channa_masala
chicken_tikka
mutter_paneer
a little of everything really
everything was so delicious
probably some of the tastiest indian_food_i've_ever_had
i am craving it right now
buys you a lunch buffet
off with student id
also
save room for the mango_ice_cream
mmmmm perfect ending
all of the other reviews are correct the food here is awesome
minus one star
though
for the decor
it was much prettier when it was the bar
ah
well
i am from seattle
and happened to be in madison for the weekend
i am a big_fan of indian food and was wondering if madison had any good places to go
i used yelp to find this place
and decided
what the heck
i'll try it out
the food here rivaled the better places i've been in seattle
it's not the best place i've been to
but it was definitely good
and i would go back
i had the chicken tandoori saag
hot
they didn't skimp on the heat
which i appreciated
and the chicken was cooked well
i would have liked the saag to have a little more spinach
but it was good nonetheless
i also had garlic_naan
which i'm moderately obsessed with
it was good
overall a good meal
i can't comment on whether or not it was pricey
it was about the same price as indian food in seattle
but i'm not sure if food is normally cheaper in madison or not
coming from california
and formally managing an indian restaurant there
i have high expectations when it comes to indian food and flavor of india lived up to it
i went to there buffet and my_only_complaint was that it was far too mild
don't_get_me_wrong the food was very flavorfull but i'd like to see more heat
i wish i had enough time in madison to go there for dinner there menu is vast and i hear from my friends its spicier too
the only weird thing is they have beef curries
san_francisco doesn't have that
i avoided this place for like two years because of the giant
student id discount
sign in the window
which i generally consider a bad sign more fool i
when my partner and i finally tried them
we were blown_away
they will make things super spicy if you ask them to
as my partner prefers
but they also make things appropriately mild if requested
i'm wimpy
their saag is delicious
one_of_my_favorites
as is their chicken tandoori kebab
although i have to be careful with the latter because i think there's something in the marinade that disagrees with me it's hard to say for sure because every time i eat it
i make a complete pig of myself
anyway
the naan is also good
various varieties we like the spinach stuffed
and my partner loves their biryani
they deliver via straight yourdoor
but if you don't want to pay the fee
they also do take out
since they're right on the square
you don't even really need to live nearby as long as you have transportation of some kind
including a direct bus route
and the student discount is good at dinnertime as well as lunch
at lunch
they have a buffet
we've never gone
but it's under a person
i just hope they get a lot of delivery and lunchtime business
because it seems like whenever we go in at dinnertime
the place is more than half empty
it'd be good for a group you wouldn't have to worry_about seating
they definitely serve beer_and_wine
not sure about hard liquor
decent indian food lacking real flavor
lacking heat
otherwise it was still good
went here for a sunday lunch with friends and overall was happy with what they had to offer
i always try everything on a buffet
unless i know for sure i won't like it
hehe
so i can say that the buffet is kinda small but does have good dishes
they're chicken_tikka_masala was so so yummy
and of course my favorite sweet dough balls
gulab_jamun was also good
my friends enjoyed the tandoori_chicken
and vegetables in a yellow curry_sauce
we also very much liked the naan
even more so when they brought out the cheese_naan
the one thing all of us detested was the papadam
it was made from lentils and although we all had a different taste reaction it it
i thought it was spicy and bad
my friend just thought it was gross
another was intrigued but didn't much like it either and could taste that it was made of lentils
we all hated it
overall
for a quick basic indian lunch
go for it
per_person
i approve
quick visit to madison and we needed something to warm our bones
found flavor of india here at yelp and figure some spice would do the trick
the place had the typical ethnic food vibe going on
quiet with white tablecloths and low lighting
nothing_to_write_home_about
but since it was pretty empty it was just fine
the food was good
i had the shrimp_vindaloo and my girlfriend had the chicken curry
my out of spice wasn't very spicy for my tastes
but we all know that depends on the kitchen's hand that night
overall
i'd give the food stars
but the service is what won the over to stars
i didn't get his name
but the male waiter we had was excellent
at the end of the night
we asked about local dessert places and he not only recommended several but used his phone to look up the exact addresses
he also told us not to go to cold stone b c it wasn't local
which always wins points for someone in my book
totally went above and beyond and it was much appreciated from this out of town tourist
surprisingly good
directly across_the_street from the capitol building in a nondescript storefront
but the interior is attractive and serene
food was tasty
large portions
reasonable_prices
service was quite good although i see from the reviews that it has been erratic for others
my_only_complaint would be that when i asked for
hot
i got the american hot
not indian
hot
this place is incredible
you know that a college city with out of every students being indian asian is going to have a pleasant supply of delicious and affordable indian food
went in for the buffet on a monday afternoon and was blown_away
plenty of vegetarian_options including saag_paneer
vegetable_korma
mushroom and pea masala
potato samosa
potato pakora
onion pakora
naan
mango_ice_cream
rice_pudding
perfect gulab_jamun
carrot halwaa
delicious zucchini and potato dish
and at least chicken beef curries as well
everything was perfectly flavored and presented
absolutely_delicious north indian_cuisine
flawlessly executed
very hospitable staff
two decent bathrooms
brand new cushions
nice lighting
just a really good dining atmosphere
lunch buffet is
that is a steal for someone coming from the west coast where they charge for a measly entree buffet
this is deluxe and delish
we went to flavor of india after a rally in madison
i do not have indian food often
so was apprehensive about the flavors and spices
the restaurant had few customers for a saturday evening
especially since all the other restaurants around the capitol were packed with protesters
the only downside of our visit was the initial amount of time it took to get service
they seemed short staffed
however
the staff members that were there were very friendly and prompt
we had to flag the server down to place our order
the food was delicious
when we left
i noted that i would come back to madison just for dinner
i had the vegetable masala
my companion had the lamb masala
we greatly enjoyed these dishes and would highly_recommend
we also had a fried_cheese appetizer
and we were not as thrilled with that
the potato nan was great as well
excellent food
very impressed
i ordered the matter_paneer and naan from straight yourdoor
com
excellent
speedy
pricey service
the matter_paneer had average flavor and spice
but it was lacking in substance
i had a hard time locating the cheese pieces
and i think that is rather unacceptable for such a high margin dish
for peas
curry and cheese
the naan was tender
but a little flavorless and dry
final assessment
average to good
and i won't be rushing to order take out from flavor of india anytime soon
i think they could do better
the diverse cuisine from the indian subcontinent varies heavily by religion and ethnicity
this place is owned and run by indian muslims
so the food is halal
preparation of the food
but especially meat
is supervised by imams
usually this means a step cleaner
more humane
than just u
s
government inspected
but this isn't always true
and they serve beef curries
you won't find this in hindu establishments
just like you won't find any pork in here
the minimum critical mass of south_asian customers is in the area thanks to the elite graduate programs of uw madison to ensure that any indian restaurant in this town has to be at least pretty good
and this one is a step up from that
we first dropped in after a long
cold day of protesting for worker rights
and inexplicably
every other restaurant and bar surrounding the capitol was packed with cold weary protesters
this one was empty
normally a warning sign
but we needed to sit_down
a very helpful madison police officer
who all seem ridiculously over educated
recommended the place
but i was a bit leery since he was slim and in good shape
i usually get my better restaurant recommendations from fat cops
what a pleasant surprise
it was dhinchak
wonderful
the service was traditionally unhurried
the waiter was friendly and polite
and unlike a lot of south_asian muslim restaurants
quite nice to my consort
my disobedient and independent gori wife
and chief of staff
the papadum was hot
fresh
and crisp
served with what seemed to be fresh made chutneys
we enjoyed the shrimp_curry
chana dal
chickpeas
and palak_paneer
a distant cousin of american creamed spinach
make sure you order an indian bread with your meal
chapati
paratha
nan
they have a good selection
a nice basmati_rice came with the meal
as it should
they have a wide_selection_of vegetarian_dishes
almost a requirement in madison
the decor is pleasant
though uninspired
nicer than the usual casual indian joints
but not as elegant as more expensive formal indian_restaurants
instead of indian music
they piped in some annoying muzak like smooth
jazz
though at a forgivable background volume
surprising for a muslim establishment
they have a good selection of wine and beer
some local
some indian
there really aren't many places in wisconsin to have wine from india
still
i recommend the indian beer instead
i highly_recommend this restaurant for you firangi types who want to try indian food
but are leery of the reputed heat of south_indian
tamil
cuisine
the food here is pretty mild
try to eat the food like we do
with your right hand
it tastes better that way
if you're a desi bhai who likes your food spicy
know that i wasn't successful in getting them to make my food nice and hot
but in general i've found that northern indian muslim cooking isn't relatively spicy
the food here is quite flavorful
it's not bland
it's just not hot enough
i did get the waiter to bring me a
hot_sauce
a red chillies paste which did have a little bite to it
finish your meal with a sweet indian desert
like galub jamun and masala tea
chai
and don't expect the waiter to come running up with the bill
they employ indo pakistani manners and expect you to relax after eating
they're pretty attentive though
so they will bring you your check when you signal for it
try to avoid if buffet hours are almost over
waiter was annoyed we came in minutes before lunch close
felt so unwelcome that i'll try not to go back
food was ok
but nothing any more memorable than other indian_buffets in the city there's several good ones
very good indian food for very reasonable_prices
especially when you consider that it is right on capitol square
you can even get a discount with a student id
i got the vegetable_korma
which was fantastic
sadly
there was no lamb_korma
but that is okay
flatbread was good
especially the potato stuffed one
we got complimentary soup
which was nice
service was very attentive
not a ton to say
otherwise
the food was good
it was very quiet and we had a nice double date
the server was friendly and wasn't afraid to take an extra minute to talk to us
it is a nice relaxing place for an evening meal
authentic_indian_food
very flavorful
reasonable portions
very fair price value by nyc standards
slightly above prices of other student venues nearby
i've only gone for the lunch buffet which is wonderful
i love their naan so much spinach
plain
i don't care
service at lunch is great with plates being removed within seconds of going for round two all for under person
i've never written a bad review on yelp because usually i don't think it's worth it but i have to stand up and say that my partner and i had a horrible experience here
i was over a year_ago
maybe even two now
but we went in for an early dinner there
we had eaten there two other times and had pretty good experiences there
he's a celiac so it's nice to find places where he can eat almost everything
we were eating our meal
the waiter was nice and we were the only ones there
when all of a sudden
there was mold in the food
he had one of the curries and when he took a bit he made a terrible face and spit it out
sure enough
there was a speck of mold in his food
basically
they reheated the thing over and over again and he was left with
a dusty
taste in his mouth
absolutely gross
i haven't even gone to an indian food joint since because of this
i'm very positive about places and worked in a restaurant for years but when i saw this on top restaurants_in_madison on yelp
i had to speak out
some of the best indian buffet food i've had
great variety
full flavor
depth and freshness
naan and rice were not dried_out
the gulab_jamun was still soft and milky
not dried_out and hard
the sauces were very rich and more flavorful
not watered_down than what i would get at any minneapolis indian buffet
great vegetarian selection
the only thing i would like to see is if they made fresh pickles
the ones they had out were pretty oil soaked
probably not crunchy
i wish this place was closer
four stars for food
two stars for service
it was fairly empty when i went there and it took the waiter forever to come get my order
i had plenty of time to look at the menu and ordered my food and drink at the same time
the food came out fairly quickly
i got the chana marsala
it was well made
pretty spicy and interestingly had veggies in it
a nice_touch
the naan was overdone
it was fairly crispy and had obviously spent too much time in the oven
the service was horrible
didnt see my waiter after he delivered my food
had to hunt down a different server for a refill on my pepsi and i had to find somebody else to bring my check and take my money
i would probably go back again
in hopes that i get better service
however the food is highly_recommended
i've tried the lunch buffet at two indian restaurants_in_madison
and i prefer flavor of india
i don't claim to know indian food well
but the flavors here just seemed a little better
although maharani has more choices
this was my first indian experience in madison
and honestly
i wasn't expecting much
however
we were pleasantly_surprised by their_lunch_buffet
which was a steal at
their food wasn't the freshest
but that's to be expected from most buffet places
their selection of food was decent
from samosas to chicken masala
from garlic_naan to potato vindaloo
from saag_paneer to rice_pudding
the waitress also made sure we never went thirsty
immediately filling up our cups the moment someone took a drink
it was actually kinda disconcerting
but meh
the turdoori chicken is good
the place is clean and the staff was friendly
the rice wasnt to my liking but it wasn't bad
also my bf got the lunch buffet deal which we ot to go and it wasn't bad
for
he got rice
lamb
chicken
some dessert thing and bread
oh and rice
and a soup
see
not a bad deal
lol
we got it to go
the place is sort of old school looking with the black and white title and pinkish decor but
like i said very very clean
oh and the meal i got was also about dollars
wasn't the cheapest but i had the meal at
i'm still full
it's not the best indian food
but for the price it's good
and the service is friendly
family_owned
the decor doesn't feel quite like an indian restaurant
but more like a diner
it's a fun mismatch
even weirder
there is also filipino food on the menu
strange combination
but i like it
i've only ever had the buffet
some of the items are hit_or_miss
but the tandoori_chicken is yummy and the aloo_gobi is also very enjoyable
the owners don't always have the same thing on the buffet
so it's always a nice surprise to see what they're serving for the day
the paneer naan is delicious and i could happily eat only that for the rest of my life
we go to vegas or times a year
we found this place by looking for indian food online
we finally got to eat there on
we really liked the food
it was fresh and tasty
the thali is especially good
the gf had this
i had the chilli chicken
never had that indian dish before
it was very
very good
had a lot of chicken in it
we will try the lunch buffet on our next trip up to vegas
in apr may
we met the owner when she took our order
very friendly
i love to see owners actually work their business
shows they care
location is easy_to_find decatur just south of the i
in the target plaza
plenty of parking
the other yelp'ers really nailed it
no ambiance with the diner booths
but the food is good
and it's family_owned
so you_can't_beat that
and the prices are great
we grabbed a restaurant
com gc for
and i ended_up paying under including tax and tip for chicken dishes
a shrimp dish
and two orders of nan
my favorite was the chicken_tikka_masala
very flavorful
wish this place was closer to my house and or was open later
but i'll be back
boo
this place is out of business
i visited hurry curry on a saturday evening for a take away dinner
i believe i visited on their second or third day of operation
i entered a restaurant with modern decor that was spotlessly clean
having read about the restaurant in the republic prior to arriving
i immediately headed towards one of the two flat screen televisions to place my order
ordering was easy and quick and the menus offered descriptions of the indian food for those who may be unfamiliar with the cuisine
i ordered butter_chicken
naan_bread and basmati_rice
this came to
it was a pleasure to see
as is done in many other countries
that the tax was included in the price of each item
while i could have swiped my credit_card to pay at the
menu monitor
i chose to pay cash and received service from the friendly lady at the cash_register
she also validated my parking in the az center garage
my butter_chicken
you can choose naan or rice as a side
was
and my naan was another dollar
which brought the total cost of my meal to
because i was ordering take away
i did not order a drink
i did
however
see that the restaurant is applying for a liquor license
presumably for the sale of beer given that there is no
bar
in the quick service space
after a wait of maybe five minutes
i received my food in what one might describe as
higher quality
chinese_food boxes
the naan_bread was wrapped in foil
after a short drive home
i transferred my food from box to plate and began to enjoy my dinner
while the rice was very well cooked
generally fluffy and not clumped together
the naan
as the republic also reported
was somewhat disappointing
while it was definitely naan and not pita_bread
i found my serving to be almost cracker like in texture and too cool of a temperature
i assume this may be because the naan was prepared earlier in the day
i wonder
though
if they could have devised a way to warm the bread before serving in a convection oven
my butter_chicken was flavorful
but also rather cool in temperature
portion_sizes were more than adequate
when i visited
the restaurant was empty
because i hope this restaurant will survive
i think the concept is novel
i sent some of the concerns detailed above in the form of constructive criticism to the restaurant after eating my dinner
would i return
sure
i enjoyed a healthy
filling and flavorful dinner for a fair price
and
when i return
i will be happy to adjust my star_rating upwards if some minor improvements have been made
ok so here is the skinny on a place i have been anticipating for quite some time
hurry curry is small
basic
and completely neat o
ordering is done via touchscreen televisions and and paid for by swiping your credit_card
if you want to pay cash
you can do so at the counter
you'll slow things down for sure
think of the visa commercials
they are pending a liquor license right now
the people working there were nice
and offered to help me with the ordering process
sorry
if you can't figure this out
you need to go off yourself immediately and stay out of the gene pool
the food is premade
and in pots in the middle of the kitchen
when you order
they go get a plate
put some rice and some main_dish on it and bring it to you
the food i got was tasty
albeit a bit underspiced
they are planning on staying open until pm nightly
i thanked them for their ambitious plans and let them know i hope they don't give up like a lot of places do
if you live in the city
and like this place
i ask you to do the same
it would suck if i got used to this for dinner and they changed to say
pm closing
too
too cool
i ordered on a touch screen
my first time doing so
the buttered chicken was awesome
i don't know much about indian cusine but this restuarant gave me a nice introduction
i will be back
alot
if_you_are_looking for a fresh change of pace then hurry curry is the place for you
i didn't know much about indian food
probably still don't know much more today
but i can say that i have eaten here several times and never have been disappointed
new slick modern place
friendly_staff
quick service all help make the place worthy of the visit
the food is outstanding
one of the things i like best is that the menu is changing all the time
there are new manager specials every time i visit
now when i order i just go for the special
it hits the spot every time
i hope everyone gets a chance to discover this place
downtown needs new creative places like this and this place makes downtown phx just a bit more interesting and lively
i cant wait for my next meal
not a bad place
its fast
convenient
and the food is not too shabby
they have a daily selection of entrees you can choose from that are premade in pots
you choose these items from a computer
and you pay at the computer
very high tech
i had the butter ck which was surprisingly edible and tasty
the naan was made on the spot with dough that they roll out and bake in their special oven
nice
i also tried the mango_lassi which was good
but i did not like the spice they sprinkle on top
for the setup
location
price and food
i will be back
every dish is different
i have tried most of the stuff on the menu
all of the dishes are flavorful
i prefer either a chicken dish like the butter_chicken or spicy curry chicken or tikka masala
i also like the dishes that use cheese
every time i make sure to get the garlic_naan no_matter_what entree i get
the price is very reasonable
the people are friendly
i have been there plenty of times and i think it is the best food joint in az center
hurry for curry
then wait
it took minutes for me to get my order
don't get it confused with the chain curry in a hurry
that would imply they are quick
also don't get it confused with naan and curry in san_francisco
because then it would be cheaper
faster and better
this is the second time i've eaten here
the first time i had the chicken curry
which took awhile too
also
i was confused
because i thought indian curry is usually thick like a paste
this curry was extremely watery
also
i was confused because they gave me a tiny little piece of undercooked bread
which i guess was supposed_to_be the naan
the second time was when i had to wait
longer i mean
when i finally got my order
my extra order of naan wasn't ready
although they certainly had enough naan for everyone_else
i sat_down
finished my food
and sure enough no extra naan
the naan i had was still undercooked
so i thought they would just under cook the extra too
since they don't bother to finish cooking it fully
furthermore
what's with the ordering through computers
are they meant to save time
or look cool
the line is always backed up with people navigating thru menus on these
also
with the automated ordering machines
they should have extra man power in the kitchen right
nope
seriously
this is indian food gone wrong
next time you have a curry craving go for any of the great indian_restaurants in the valley
i've liked all the ones i've tried
or if you're downtown
go next_door to the mexican restaurant
the pizza place
or
never thought i'd say this
subway
if you have the time hop over to breadfruit or pastabar
or just wait till people tire of this place and after it closes
eat at the new restaurant that takes its place
besides for my food not being especially hot
the food was great
quick service
good food
and great prices
if i lived there i would be returning often
i was jonesing for chicken_tikka_masala
after resisting the temptation to be the loser eating at an indian buffet alone i decided to try this new place i'd been hearing about
after fighting downtown traffic and parking
i walk up to the touch screen and discover no tikka masala
super lame
apparently the menu changes daily
i begrudgingly order the butter_chicken and some naan
i was pleasantly_surprised
i was expecting a generic pei wei experience but aside from the naan being a little rubbery and oily it was actually quite tasty
i really wish this place wasn't in the black hole that is the arizona center
er
copper square
whatever
by the looks of how dead it is at lunchtime i don't know how good the survival rate is but i'm excited to go back and try some of the other items
was so excited to have an indian restaurant in downtown phoenix that i can go to for lunch
was instantly disappointed that they offer a limited selection of menu_items
their menu changes daily and they offer a handful of items each day
plus
they only use dark chicken meat
hello
white is so much healthier for you
the food wasn't very flavorful
portions were decent but would have much rather had a buffet
ate there today as a family after the movies
the menu changes daily and you use a touch screen to order no problem
however
after i ordered
i stood in front of the counter to get cups for water for more than min and was completely ignored by the two staff members
finally when another customer was paying cash for his ordered something that still requires human interaction i was able to catch their attention and get my cups
so customer_service non existent
the food was pretty good
we had butter_chicken
vindaloo chicken and dal with two extra naan's on the side
the best entree was butter_chicken
the vindaloo was tasty but not nearly as spicy as it should have been
the naan was freshly_made on the spot
overall though
i'd rather have gone to one of the many indian_buffets for lunch same price
better food and value
of course
don't think there are any in the area
so you'd have to make a trip
got takeout here the other night
disappointed there's no tikka or vindaloo on the menu but meh
it rotates so maybe i'll get lucky next time
the service was courteous and fast
price was right
portions were adequate
naan turned out ok
as did the veg biryani and kidney masala
i got butter_chicken and the kidney masala to go tonight
and dipped my tongue in tastes ok
i'd say more
but i'm in a hurry
bitches
next morning edit
bummer
they burned the bean curry this time
butter_chicken was fine
looks like the neighborhood still desperately needs decent indian takeout
indian food
new fangled technology
cute name
central location
convenient to light rail
there's plenty to like
theoretically
but our experience here was one and done
we arrived early evening
before a ballgame
it seemed a little off peak
like maybe the b team was on duty
we ordered via the touch screen
and after a couple tries
generated a receipt
then waited a long while for
fast_food
and it seemed longer because you dont get a human confirmation that it's even in progress
half the wait
i wondered if there was a problem moreso because workers behind_the_counter looked as disoriented and idle as we were
eventually
they brought the food
or we retrieved it
i forget
but none of this inspired much confidence or good will
my curry was on the bland side
not terrible
but this place is altogether too tentative
dinner before a show at the herberger
we ate at hurry curry at the arizona center
a small place where you order pay at a computer then pick_up your food at the counter
it seems everything was prepared in advance
as all of our orders were filled very quickly
all four of us ordered something different and we shared
my favorite was the butter_chicken
also the naan was good
served piping_hot
pretty good indian food in phoenix
i'm waffling between and stars
will i eat at hurry curry again
yes
why
it was fast
it was not a sandwich
it is close to work
ok
i'm going with stars because i will most likely go there over the other
in a hurry
options at the arizona center
my co_worker picked_up our food
she said the touch screen ordering was great
and we both got the butter_chicken
it was ok nothing out_of_this_world amazing
but it was very saucy
which i like
next time
i'll probably get something with some spice
i didn't realize it was not going to be spicy at all
imagine the pickiest eater in the world
then times it by a million
that's my boss and most times i'm afraid to even suggest a place to eat to him
he took me to this underrated downtown gem and i was instantly hooked
first of all
if you don't know indian food that's ok
simply ask one of the servers for a sample
they will let you sample everything but the made to order black pepper shrimp
my favorites are the chicken_vindaloo and butter_chicken
you must order some rice and garlic na'an to have the full taste experience
this is why you see some yelpers complain_about the sauciness and or lack of fulfillment with their meals
the spicy chicken briyan
sp
is quite good
but has that all spice taste to it that always rubs me the wrong way
my cousins are half pakistani and i have had excellent indian food
this place is not far behind
so give it a shot
and again
don't be shy to ask for a sample
i was initially excited at the idea of fast indian food
the ordering eperance at the kiosk is novel
on my first and only trip to hurry curry i was a bit disappointed
the menu lacked the number of options one would see at other indian reatraunts
i ordered a dish that equated to a black stew of lentils and spices with naan
despite the limited menu and ordering format it too the food several minutes to be ready
for the price
no drink
the portion was very small as was the piece on naan
the flavors were quite muted when compared to some indian places
and this also disappointed me as i like bold and spicy indian foods
i gave their condiment a try
it looked like onions and peppers in a sauce
however it was just very very salty and lack any other flavor
i then went to get my parking validated
i then found out when leaving the garage that the validation that this place offered was virtually useless
this ended_up adding another to a quick and small indian lunch
i was intrigued by the computer kisok ordering
however not getting the human interaction acknowledgement that your order was received on was uncomfortable for me
i ordered thier butter_chicken and was given the choice of either rice or naan
why can't i have both for the
i can add to get both for at least extra
and a mango_lassi
i selected my order to go and awkwardly waited
wondering if they got my order
if i was supposed to wait at the counter for my mango_lassi or if it all came out at once
it wasn't busy
like customers waiting on to go orders
but the employees appeared just as awkward trying to put the food together
the man before me had ordered one of their specials that day the butter_chicken wrap
the butter_chicken was way to saucy for a wrap and the workers were clearly flustered by the fact that it was busting thru the naan
the employees there wanted to make it over for him but he said he would take it as is
they make their naan one at a time
which means you get it fresh but adds to the wait
like many of the other reviewers i waffled between and stars
while the food was good
not great
the awkwardness of the expereince has me dropping it to a
will i go back
yeah
until i get a good indian restaurant downtown
i wavered between and stars on this one
but i decided to be nice and round up
i work in the arizona center
i walk by hurry curry probably or times a day
but do not venture in
why
i really don't have a taste for indian food
but came here with scott w at his request
experience was okay
company was definately more exciting then the restaurant itself
for starters
menu was limited and pricey
i went with the butter_chicken on naan
ordered at the kiosk
and paid with my card
poor scott went serveral minutes before he was able to pay with cash
drink area is self serve
we ended_up eating outside
tables were wobbly
and you had to be careful
i've lost plates of food and hot drinks in my day from wobbly tables
i get nervous
my food was warm
not hot
but warm
i was dissapointed that it wasn't cooked hot
anyways
i will be back
but only if someone else wants me to go with them
this place gets a weak
thursday evening i attended
title of show
at the herberger
oye
and decided i wanted to eat before the show
i found out amy b was going and i asked if she wanted to meet me somewhere close
arizona center doesn't offer much in the way of cheap and quick and i wanted more than a sandwich
i suggested this place and she said ok as she had not yet tried it either
ordering was simple
the kiosk had links to descriptions and stuff
without much going on in the place the folks working there seemed real busy without accomplishing anything
and we sort of got ignored for a few minutes at the counter
and later
while we were eating
there seemed to be a bit of swapping of drinks and things with mi amigo's next_door
and at one point one of the employees went around the corner and i think borrowed some foil pans from someplace
i like the idea that friendly competitors will help each other out
also while we were eating the manager appeared and made the rounds of the tables to see how folks were doing
amy chose a butter_chicken wrap and i ordered the butter_chicken with rice
and a soda
i don't eat much indian middle eastern mediterranean food so i didn't really have a lot to compare against
my americanized description is marinated chicken with rice covered in gravy
the only difference would be the seasonings in the marinade and the gravy
it was ok and a change from some of the more common fast_food items
it was
however
only lukewarm
i think that has to do with a couple of things
the food is kept warm in big clay pots and the choice of styrofoam plates
styrofoam doesn't handle high heat well but if they used paper it doesn't handle gravies very well
they can't win on that one
i thought the meal was priced fairly given the location and the prep involved
given the choice of a similar cuisine i would choose pita jungle
that isn't to say i would rule out going back here again if i was in the area
this place is hip
how do i know
they followed the code of m
c
hammer
too legit to quit
boooohhhh ring
legit quit
whoa
hip and innovative
i for one love integers
so imagine my enthusiasm when they decided not to open a hurry for curry and instead opened a hurry curry
there's all sorts of reasons feel lukewarm about hurry curry
the self serve touchscreens
are people really that excited about this
have they never touched an ipod
i don't understand the thrill of being your own check out person
a la the grocery_store
isn't that what the people behind_the_counter are being paid to do
and i get to do it for free
a rotating menu
look
i can't tell vindaloo from biryani from benny agbayani
that's a baseball zing
so i don't have indian food favorites
but if i did
i think i'd find it really frustrating if i went in and my favorite thing was unavailable just because the owner cooks are bored
maybe the prices are good
maybe they're not
my meal
drink and naan was
rupees
err
excuse me
ten dollars and fifty cents
it doesn't feel like a good deal for fast_food
the postiives
naan_bread was warm and delicious
some added variety to an arizona center devoid of culinary inspiration
people
please stop going to hooters
two worst meals of my life
also
did i mention this already
they have an integer in their name
it's not destination dining but a good break from chain hell
good place for lunch
most dishes are quite spicy
i wished the biryani was a bit milder
naan is so so
i love the automated touchscreen order
i really want to love_this_place
the food is fresh and flavorful
the servings are large enough to share unless you're really hungry
the garlic_naan rocks and the butter_chicken is still my favorite
i recommend always getting the rice with this dish
well i always get rice and naan with this
my main issue is still with the concept
and the employees while friendly and willing to serve still manage awkwardly in the kitchen
this visit they were having to play catch up from the previous shift which leftpots empty and dishes dirty
it was delaying the orders
the self serve ordering process is neat o and fast
but the food is not good at all
i had the daal
which lacked any trace of flavor
just imagine some lentils in a starchy
soupy goop
some salt might have been nice
any seasoning really
it was barely edible
with a thorough dousing of tabasco
the naan was in insult to all that is naan
instead of light
fluffy bread
with a crispy
slightly charred shell
i got a tough
greasy
tortilla like thing
slathered in a butter like substance
two stars for the concept and the really tasty iced_tea
closed
it would seem they did not pay their rent and the az center locked them out
finding something different amongst the hundreds of chinese
indian or italian restaurants_in_edinburgh can be a challange however
located near the city's university
namaste kathmandu may just be the place you were looking for
specialising in both indian and neplaese dishes
there is no chance of you not finding something you want to try on either the main or lunch time menu's or at least
thats what i found
the daal which i ended_up settling for way fantastically presented
and thankfully tasted as good as it looked
with a large dining_area
as well as a private function room
for up to thirty guests
kathmandu is a great place for a different night out
looking for something to eat around downtown edinburgh we found this nepalese place among pubs and food chains
good warm food
at reasonable_prices
i had a mild chicken order and didn't get disappointed
when you there order the nepalese section of the menu as the indian part you can find anywhere_else
i really love indian food
and there's nothing like that feeling of culinary satisfaction when you're presented with an awesomely tasty meal
with the perfect mixture of flavours and spice_levels you require for your fusspot palate
namaste offers up all of these delightful factors for your consumption
plus the food looks great when it's presented
with the traditional brass looking bowls and serving spoons
this is well above_average indian_cuisine
and really reasonably_priced considering that fact
i love the karahi dishes
and the classic rogan_josh
but there are a range of both indian and nepalese dishes to select from
the staff at namaste are super friendly and accomodating
and there's a fair amount of seating room
although you might have to book ahead at weekends
the interior
although nothing super fashionable or over the top
is comfortable and feels welcoming
you're also minimal steps away from various grassmarket drinking joints if you fancy imbibing a few after dinner
i first ate at namaste kathmandu several months_ago with friends as we thought it was a japanese restaurant with it being called 'namaste'
and so we were quite confused when it materialised that this is an indian and nepalese place
oh well
it was still a delicious meal
situated just around the corner from the main university campus george square
namaste kathmandu is a convenient place to reach and would be a great place to go for dinner or lunch
namaste katmandu's menu offers a selection of authentic nepalese and indian dishes including dumplings and curry's
and their menu is split into nepalese and indian meals so you know what type of curry you are ordering
i had a nepalese vegetarian soup to start which was really tasty and clearly made with fresh_ingredients
for my main
i ordered the fish tikka curry
which was marinated sword fish and it was tasted really amazing
full_of_flavour and super fresh yum
they have a huge selection of vegetarian_dishes on the menu so there is something for everyone
it is also pointed_out on the menu which curry's are mild and which are hot
which is incredibly handy and means you won't get your head blown off with an unexpected chili
the prices are really reasonable at namaste kathmandu
with most main_dishes priced at round eight pounds
a lovely place to go for gorgeous tasting food
namaste kathmandu serves excellent nepalese and indian food
the combination of these two similar cuisines makes for a more interesting experience and you can compare where the two types of food differ
i've not eaten much nepalese food so i went for the bhute ko kukhura which was chicken marinated in a whole range of spices
my mate went for the fish tikka which looked delicious and creamy
our meals seemed to take no time to arrive and tasted great when they did
my chicken was pretty spicy
but it also had an amazing range of flavours and the chicken was as tender as i've tasted
our meals
along with some boiled rice
cost less than a tenner which was a brilliant deal considering the quality and portion_sizes of the food
we'll hopefully be here again
i went here with a friend on arriving in edinburgh and i'm not sure where it's because i had such a wonderful experience at the amazing gurkha's diner in balham but i was unfortunately left a little underwhelmed
the food was good
i had the pudini chicken and my friend had the lamb palak
unfortunately they got confused with our dishes and announced them incorrectly so we ended_up with the wrong dishes
however
we'd intented to share anyway so no bother really but coupled with the fact that they brought us the wrong side dishes
it wasn't so good
i always appreciate attentive service in a restaurant but here it was a little too much for me
to check once
maybe twice
during a meal is usually enough
however
our waiters checked in with us five times and just made me feel a little under pressure
my friend was performing in a show a little later on so we decided to only have a glass_of_wine each
i like to drink but didn't think the best part of a bottle_of_wine on my own after a hour train journey was the best idea
however
the waiter almost told us off for not purchasing a whole bottle which was a little off putting
there's a good choice of food on offer with both nepalese and indian dishes and all the food tasted great and is good value_for_money
it's just a shame the service lets it down a little
the food here was good bhindi was flavourful
mango_lassi was just the right consistency
papamdums and rice were good accompaniments
that aside
i found the service here was a bit poor and inattentive it took us minutes to get the bill and i found that our waiter constantly trying to upsell us on everything from beer to appetizers
felt_like eating at a used car lot
i have experienced a lot better than this
and a lot cheaper too
our food was lukewarm and lacking in meat
especially for the price paid
i'd avoid like the plague
to be honest
the first time i ate the food from namaste was by ordering take away i've recently been to the restaurant to eat in as well my opinion about the restaurant remains unchanged
the food is quite delicious and is well presented
the selection is fantastic as there is a large variety and had both indian and nepalese cuisines
the restaurant could do with a bit of brightening up as it's quite dim inside
my only quarrel is that it is slightly pricy and i have have better food for much less
nonetheless it is different from the usual variety that is available in edinburgh
i would recommend the paneer makhni and the prawn malabari
my favourite dishes yum
one of my favorite restaurant in the world
best nepalese hymalayan i ve tried so far
just beware of spicy level
it's very different from indian cusine
if you don't spice a bit it is a bit too sweet
like the decor a lot
i dropped into tandoori_times one night after reading a good review about it in a newspaper
i spent a few years in the bay_area
where i became accustomed to tasty hole_in_the_wall indian food joints rich with sauces and flavors
the only thing they typically lacked
though
was presentation
the restaurants were often uncomfortable or dirty but
in spite of that
the food made it worth_the_trip
tandoori_times is unique
first of all
there is very little quality indian food in the phoenix metro
so that alone sets it apart
on top of that
its appeal is radically different from what i experienced around sf
this place is clean and cool
with sleek decor and comfortable booths to boot
the naan was fantastique
and the food was almost as good
but not quite
the richness and abundance of flavors weren't quite as present as with their slightly grosser counterparts in cali
not cheap
but
then again
hard to come by
i'll be headed back the next time i start feeling the need for some tandoori_chicken and naan
i liked tandoori_times
but it is just too difficult to get to if you don't live in the area
i thought the food was not the normal indian_fare that i have eaten
presentation was stepped up a bit
food quality was great
i was a bit disappointed by the selelction of food
but i guess it is better to do a few key things well than offer a bunch of variety that is not as good
tables and booths were dressed up a bit
i would return here if in the area
but otherwise i prefer maharaja palace
as i ate my umpteenth takeout meal from here tonight
mmm
malai_kofta
i thought it was about time for me to review this place
i really like it
the food at tandoori_times is just more flavorful than it is at many other indian_restaurants in phoenix
and i believe the ingredients are of a better quality
i do wish they had slightly more vegetarian_options here
and i really wish they had pakoras on the appetizer list but other than that
i can't complain
and
while i like the place
my husband absolutely loves it
especially their lamb dishes
also
i have to admit
i'm emotionally attached to this place as my husband and i had the rehearsal dinner for our wedding here last october
they were able to pull it together for us with only a few weeks notice
our other selection had flaked out on us at the last minute
they were really accommodating when we were running late that night
and even started bringing out appetizers to our guests who got there before us
it was supposed_to_be a buffet
but they were thoughtful enough to improvise
everyone loved the food
from the meat and potatoes midwestern uncles to the indian aunties
so that says a lot right there
also
their outside patio is lovely
moved to n
hayden rd
in scottsdale
indian_cuisine is my nose
mouth and eye's favorite food
although my stomach sometimes would disagree mildly
but i don't care
it's worth it
upon entering tandoori_times
located next to the brand new
forbidden
night club on th avenue in old town
scottsdale
i notice what i like to call an honesty kitchen
the first thing i noticed
was the familiar fragrances one always smells upon entering and indian restaurant
i have never seen an honesty kitchen in an indian restaurant
it was amazing
not only can you watch the chef's skewering the meats and vegetables on the long spikes and placing them into the enormous tandoor ovens
you can also see them do little dances as they cook
i enjoyed watching them just a bit more than the belly_dancer
on busier nights
although she was just darling
i avoided her whenever possible
back to the food you can find the usual fare of naan
tandoori
masalas
chutney as well as a bevy of vegetarian favorites
each time i have been into the restaurant i was met by the gracious owner
sonny
who has greeted me kindly
his friendly and surprisingly knowledgeable staff are equally welcoming
the patio is roomy but last i checked
needed some attention
i would probably not dine here then go to forbidden for all night dancing
but that's just me
instead
i would recommend the opposite
you may not find what you want at the clubs
but you will find it at tandoori_times
alas
my craving_for_indian_food came to the point where i had to breakdown and eat indian food on the west coast
i'm sorry to say that my craving for indian was not met and the
timing
to eat at
tandoori_times
couldn't have been worse
to start off my first sign of disappointment was when i called to see if the had a lunch buffet
they didn't
what indian restaurant doesn't do a lunch buffet
well two to be in exact
which happens to be the only two indian_restaurants in old town scottsdale
tandoori_times and jewel of the crown
which is where i work
of course
the cuisine
first off
i'm a big believer that you can judge an indian restaurant by their chicken_tikka_masala
so since this was my first visit to tandoori
i had to try it
let's just say it was okay at best
the tikka masala was little bit spicier than usual
which is fine with me
and it also had the right consistency and richness from the cream you expect
but it missed the slight sweetness that contrasts the spices from the sauce
disappointing
next was the naan
the naan came out warm and had that ever so slight crispy outside that i adore
but the inside was slightly doughy or little too moist
which made the naan slightly chewy after it cooled off
it was still good
but come on
you can at least master the basics right
wrong
let's go to the rice
first and foremost i don't ever recall where you had to pay for rice at any indian restaurant
well guess what
i did
to be exact
and for
did they master this staple side dish
noooo
it wasn't like it was horrible but i have never had indian rice that was oily
it was slight
but you could taste and feel it
overall texture and flavor was sub par
but i couldn't get over the slightly oily taste and texture
all i could think was that i was eating chinese fried_rice
b c of the oiliness
with my tikka masala
sigh
oh well
atleast they gave a hearty portion
decor was adequate
dark green and red colored sheer covered sections of walls and was used a divider to break up the room
but what was up with the standard white office acoustical tiles in the ceiling
atleast black it out like most restaurants
i felt_like i was at work or in some weird episode of the office
an episode when steve carell's character
michael
decides to go to an indian restaurant at lunch and notices the same thing
but to only make an erroneous comment out loud so everyone in the restaurant could here
starts mocking indians and their accent and everything then goes down hill
something i would only laugh if on tv
but would not in real life
i couldn't get over the fact that on top of that they had the audacity to then painted random acoustical tiles dark red and blue
which made your eyes look up at the ceiling
i'm clueless on that one
anyways
i am very hard pressed to find a reason to go back tandoori_times
for all you phoenicians you never had indian food
save your taste_buds and go to nyc or anywhere back east and try it there
but if you get the urge
i would suggest go to india delhi palace on mcdowell road
the food is actually pretty good
for az standards that is
more along the lines of stars
okay
so as a person of indian descent
i had to comment on tandoori_times
it's damn good
i took my parents and friends out there
we ordered basically one of everything and a ton of kingfishers
best indian beer ever
and spent less than
lunch is not too shabby either
any one of their wraps hits the spot
they're extra yummy because they use naans as the wrap
my mother
who despises going to indian_restaurants
even liked it
i just went to tandoori_times tonight for my friend's birthday and i really liked it
everything was delicious
especially the lamb
and the naan was soo good
the garlic_naan
the cheesy naan was a little bland
the service was good
and they gave my friend a free dessert
i did think the restaurant could have used a little more personality
maybe some nicer decorations or better music
but otherwise it was great
would_definitely_go_back again
i met a friend_of_mine here for lunch the other day
she has raved_about this indian food place that she said i had to try
i used to live in the bay_area of california
and i had some of the best indian food while i was there
so i was a little skeptical that i would find something good here in arizona
my friend was right
the food here is awesome
i liked the variety of naan that they had here
from plain to garlic to whole_wheat
we got the whole_wheat
which soaked up the yummy goodness of the sauce that came with my lamb masala
this dish was just spicy enough
very flavorful
and the lamb was super tender
my friend is a veggie and got the dal_makhani
which my carnivorous self actually found quite tasty
and to top it all off
they had some chai_tea that was out_of_this_world
it's a far cry from the sweetened chai stuff that you get at starbucks
very flavorful
the service here was very great and attentive
i'm not sure how this place would be around the dinner hour
but for lunch we were seated quickly and served quickly as well despite quite a few people being there
i can't_wait_to_come_back
food
everything i ate chicken_tikka
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_biryani
mattar pineer
lamb_vindaloo
mumbai shrimp
and garlic_naan were all great
i drank a king fisher
indian beer
and it was pretty good
better than most american bottled beers
mango_lassi was good
as it is in most places
price
it's about for each dish
and for naan
atmosphere
decently nice restaurant
not very much indian decor
the music can get a little too loud
right when i jokingly said
a belly_dancer should come out and dance to this music
one actually freakin did
a white one
it was entertaining and awkward
but when a little girl went to dance like the belly_dancer
that was hilarious
i swear that little kid danced for an_hour straight
service
the waiter
who i've seen at campus multiple_times
was helpful and polite
skinny
this is the best indian restaurant i've been to in the phoenix area
i'm going back for sure to satisfy my indian food cravings
any place that has belly_dancers shake their stuff in your face during dinner gets high marks in my book
i think the belly_dancer
s
are there only on the weekends around
but you might want to check it out
loved the food
garlic_naan
very good
the kitchen is partially open which is nice because you can see them put the meat skewers out of the ovens
maybe they call them tandoors or something
anyways very good food
i bit more upscale than most other_indian_places in the valley
sometimes i get a real hankering for indian food
we decided by the reviews we read to try tandoori_times
love it
we've been back a few times since
everything i've tried there i've loved
my favorite is the saag ghost
my only disappointment is that they don't serve pakora's at dinner
and i never make it there for lunch
but they redeemed themselves by having one of my favorite white wines on the menu
torrontes
the belly_dancer is cool
just make sure you don't sit under one of the speakers in the ceiling
they crank it
definitley one of my favorite restaurants_in_the_valley
tandoori_times never disappoints
their naan_bread is excellent
any dish i have ordered has always been delicious
tandoori_times is good for a romantic dinner or a casual get together with friends or family
oh f ck yeah
okay so ive had indian food before
generally the stuff you can buy at trader joe's or make can make at home
however i have never been to an indian restaurant before
ive always wanted to try but the health reports and the chronic cockroach problems always seemed to keep me and the mr away
after seeing a write up on chow bella i decided that i'd take the plunge
it was so worth the chance
totally clean
super friendly_staff
great drinks and delicious food
we ordered heavy to cross section the menu
not one dish sucked out of the dishes that we ordered
the rice_pudding made certain parts of me stand on end
it was that good
i'm very much looking_forward to coming here again
if i were into the ladies i would have buried my face right into the belly_dancers boobs
seemed like the thing to do after a couple of the best long island ice teas
since everyone in my family digs tandoori_times
i've wandered in for eight or nine earlybird dinners and
honestly
i'm a little underwhelmed
definitely not bad or awful
but maybe if i sandwiched a later supper between undulating bare bellied vixens and a couple of kingfishers
i'd stumble out with a hazier
and happier
overall impression
nothing i've_ever_eaten here was truly bad enough to take back or savory enough to inspire a return_visit
portions tend to be small and sauces are
by and large
mild and rather one dimensional
other than the garlic_naan
i cant remember a dish smelling really awesome as it wafted by
which is a shame considering indian_cuisine is among the world's most aromatic
i was eager to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob
as the portion was good sized about small cubes of lamb
not mega kabob sized cubes
but a very respectable portion for
on the usual tandoori bed of onions and peppers
the lamb exterior was nice crusty
but the inside wasnt moist and tender like you'd_expect from tandoori instead it was hard
chewy and disappointing
companion's entree was tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in a thick sauce
that looked more like an appetizer
chicken dishes are generally better the tandoori version is good
and similar to most indian joints
i recommend the three hot relishes
red sauce
green puree
and pickled peppers
provided tableside
as house preparations
at least in my experience
tend to be mild
servers are generally anglo
pleasant and competent during the meal
but just about every time we walk in for dinner at or
the entire operation seems almost startled by our presence
nobody's overtly rude
but instead of a really warm welcome
you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at the bar staring at you
as if mentally choosing straws to see who has to deal with the first dinner customer of the evening
it's not oppressive
but it's happened more than once and i'm not crazy about the vibe
i do like the complimentary
self serve chai_tea and open kitchen
providing an opportunity to stretch one's legs and socialize a bit
nice touches
the menu_is_extensive
all told about sixty items
and reasonably_priced for indian food
indian textiles
jewelry and artwork is often on display
for sale
and the house music is too loud if you have the misfortune to be seated under a ceiling speaker
it got turned down
eventually
but any restaurant with a few years under it's belt ought to understand customary american tolerances better than that
the atmosphere is up and down
food's ok
service is ok
ask my family and they'll each give it four or five_stars
in my book
tandoori_times is just ok
well i am not the best person to ask about east indian_cuisine
it would not be on my list of top choices
so that being said
i will share my impressions of tanroori times
i have been there twice for lunch
both times my party had the same waitress
and both times she was so slooooowwwww
the second time she accidentally charged us for instead of chicken lunch_specials
we were honest pointing out the undercharge
she proceeded to totally screw up the change
pocketing the cash
and then overcharging the three debit cards as if we did not supply cash as well
if i did not know better i would have said she was blonde
sheeshh
they desperately need some sort of new ventilation system
it smells like all the smoke from the kitchen is not venting out correctly
the ac is way too cold
several in my party were cold
and the bathrooms were gross
the food was tasty
but i'll pass on this one next time
my belief has always been that at a restaurant
nothing matters but the food
service can be abysmal as long as the food is good
tandoori_times has changed my beliefs about this
and i now realize that service can be so amazingly terrible that it can completely ruin a dining_experience
dinner started innocently enough
we sat at a table not far from the bar
and our server started out asking us what we'd like to drink
the server had a young kid with her
maybe years old
and the kid was helping her with things
i thought it was kind of strange
but i assumed it was probably our server's kid and that she couldn't find a babysitter for the night or something no big_deal
i ordered a dirty martini
and our server went back to the bar to mix our drinks
she told us the bartender had already gone home for the night
even though it was only pm
since our table was near the bar
we could hear what was going on there
and within a minute or two
i heard the server asking the rest of the staff if they knew where the olive juice was
after a minute or two of searching
the staff concluded that they were out of olive juice
at this point
i expected our server to come back and ask if she could get me a different drink
she didn't
instead
she started asking the staff what she could substitute for olive juice
and they concluded that saltwater would be good
ugh
she brought me the drink and pretended it was completely normal and nothing was wrong
i pretended i didn't know any better
took a sip of the drink
and told her it was beyond awful and it tasted like they had used salt instead of olive juice
she acted like she couldn't imagine why this was
and she said that she would take the drink off of my bill
when she picked the drink up from the table to take it away
the young kid i mentioned earlier bumped into her and knocked the drink out of her hand
she spilled a bit of it on me
and most of it on the floor
she then walked away and offered no help of any kind no napkins or anything
this spilled drink stayed on the floor the entire rest of the meal
and they never cleaned it up
when we eventually left
i was tempted to
slip
on it
pretend i severely hurt myself
and start yelling about how careless their staff was
how they could be held liable for injuries
blah blah blah
i just wanted someone to recognize that it was ridiculous for them to not clean up things that they had spilled
but it really seemed like they didn't care at all
anyway
the server asked if i wanted something else to drink instead
i went for a gin and tonic
when she got back to the bar
the first thing i heard was
what's in a gin and tonic
how do i make one
sigh
anyway
the gin and tonic turned out okay
all things considered
but at this point i was pretty sad from what had already happened
finally
we got to ordering our food
our server came over
asked what we'd like
and as we started telling her
we noticed she wasn't paying any attention
she was just watching her kid and talking to her
so
we got to repeat our order again
and this time she actually paid attention and wrote it down
yay
awhile later
our food came out we got two naans
one paneer
one chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
palak_paneer
and rice
the naans were pretty average
nothing really special
the chicken_tikka_masala was actually pretty good
and was the only decent part of the whole meal
the palak_paneer was some of the worst i've ever had
and i'm pretty sure they just emptied a defrosted bag of frozen spinach over some cubes of paneer
it tasted like no spices or any kind of flavoring had been added
in the middle of eating
we were interrupted by the server and her kid for a rather awkward moment
the server made her kid apologize for knocking over my drink
and then they walked away
congratulations tandoori_times on making our dinner that much more uncomfortable
our server didn't seem to care about anything throughout the whole meal she never asked how anything was
if we needed anything
etc
when we were done eating
she came by and dropped off the check
without removing our plates from the table or even saying a word
we had been charged an extra
just to have rice with our entrees
which i think is pretty ridiculous
anyway
i took out my credit_card and she came by to pick_it_up
again without saying a word
we left quickly
wanting to get our tandoori_times experience over with as soon as possible
when we left
i was pretty frustrated and angry
which is not how one should feel when leaving a restaurant
i will never
ever
ever come back here again
check out their mutter_paneer
and the curries
complimentary chai just walk up to the bar and serve yourself
order some naan
excellent paneer wrap with tamarind_sauce
if_you're_looking for good value
check out their daily specials
small sized entree
side salad
naan
and rice
for those with a sweet tooth
like me
try their huge pieces of gulab_jamun
mmmm
one huge caveat that begs the question of the authenticity of the meals served at this restaurant the appearance of beef in the menu
holy cow
this is the main reason i haven't gone back
therefore
when i'm dining in scottsdale
i am either at jewel of the crown or indian delhi palace on mcdowell
i thought this place was not that good for indian food
the place was not that clean
overall i have had much better pakistani indian food and wouldn't really recommend_this_place_to_anyone who would want very good food
imagine if you were pakastani and you wanted to open a restaurant that would cater to the mainstream
you would make it trendy inside
you would offer a nice bar
you would hire american people as your servers
and you would make the food not so spicy
in essence
you would create the pf chang's of indian food
you would give it an indian sounding name like tandoori_times and remove any vestiges of pakistan as indian_restaurants are better recognized and thus seen as a safer option among the mainstream
well
that's exactly what tandoor times is
being indian
i prefer indian food meaning i like all the grilled meat items but they better be able to make quality sabjis and vegetarian_dishes too
tandoori_times is a pakastani restaurant
it's not an indian restaurant
it's almost the same but their dishes are different
pakastani cuisine involves tandoori items and grilled items
their cooking style is less spicy and offers less cream in their dishes
indian
punjani north_indian
food involves tandoor items as well in addition to vegetable dishes
more variety and types of curries and is spicier and more flavorful in general
if you are a non vegetarian like myself
you can survive on the curries and the shish kebob and other meat items
however
when you taste their chaat
deserts and vegetarian sabjis
this restaurant clearly does not know what they are doing
if you are vegetarian of indian descent
you will be sorely disappointed
nothing against pakastani cuisine but vegetarian_dishes are not your forte much like curries and grilled options are not really a part of south_indian cooking
the food is on the mild side
of course
if you ask them to make something hotter
they can but their food in general is not very spicy and is bland with the exception of some of their curries
if you are a non indian and you want to try indian food for the first time
this would be a good place to start
if you are someone who has eaten quality indian food and wants the real thing
avoid this place because this is as far from being the real thing as possible
the service and ambience was quite nice
i think that's the real draw of this restaurant since most indian_restaurants have poor service and often a dirty or claustrophobic environment
this is a trendy restaurant in old town scottsdale that you could take a date to
the service was good when we went there but at the same time the servers were pretty ignorant of the menu and didn't know a lot about indian food
being indian
this place was just a bunch of hype
yes
it was neat to see friendly american people serving indian food since i'm used to indian waiters who are abrupt and to the point
i liked the ambience but the food was disappointing
their palak_paneer honestly tasted as if some non indian person decided to try and make it from a cookbook at home
it was not spicy nor was it cooked properly
their malai_kofta was not even malai_kofta
let's put it that way
i will say this
their tandoori chicke was probably the best i've had in the valley and that's not suprising since pakastani cooking involves meat and they know how to grill meat well but outside of their meat dishes
it was completely lackluster
the bottom_line is that if you are an indian person or a person who is used to eating quality indian food and you want honest to goodness quality indian
not pakastani
food
avoid this place
if you are a non indian person wanting to check out indian pakastani food and just want to have a good time
this place is for you
note
however that the prices are rather high for an indian pakastani restaurant so you are paying for that ambience
oh man this was good indian food
coming from a native
i hope this means something
another restaurant close to my hotel so i decided to try it out on my way back
ate at my big fat greek restaurant last_night
to the room
seating confused me at first because the sign said seat yourself but there was also a host directing people to tables
whatever
pretty extensive_menu
i ordered the beef seekh kabab wrap and the butter_chicken with rice and a plain_naan
kind of annoying that none of the curries come with rice or naan
and rice is
for a plain_naan
luckily i was on the expense account so i didn't care about the cost too much
food took a while to come out
but there was also a large_party ahead of me which got served first
the kabab wrap consisted of a monster thick kabab
nothing wimpy like some other restaurants to with the usual accompaniments
the butter_chicken was thick and creamy and the serving dish was filled to the brim
almost overflowing
there was a decent amount of chicken in there
definitely not skimpy like many other restaurants
it tasted delicious and no one seasoning was overpowering
the portion was pretty big and between the kabab wrap and the butter_chicken
two people could easy have eaten and been satisfied
overall delicious food and pretty good service
they don't really have a full bar
as they advertise
there are maybe spirits with a few mixers
and beer
i didn't imbibe
but the selection was pretty standard fare
rum
scotch
tequila
vodka
and looked decently priced
at least according to the drink menu
tandoori_times turned_out_to_be an impromptu valentine's dinner for my husband and i
we just usually don't do dinner out on v day
not that we have anything against the big day
but my idea of a romantic dinner out does not involve other couples having their special dinner at the same time
anywho
fondue was the plan
but i neglected to buy anything to dip into the imaginary cheese i also failed to buy
we settled on tandoori as neither of us had been there
just down the street from home
and we didn't expect it to be a major valentine's destination
i was pleasantly_surprised they were offering a complimentary rose for the ladies
complimentary
as in free
no dude peddling his roses to unsuspecting men who may have previously neglected the flower ritual and know they are damned if they do
like a rose is going to make up for screwing up the flower thing
and damned if they don't
he's so cheap
he couldn't even buy me a stinkin' rose
nice_touch
no pressure
woman happy
all is well
we started with the bread basket which had to be a concoction of robert atkins' evil twin
it had four kinds of naan
plain
onion
garlic
and potato
we ate all we could and then some and still had leftovers
i had the chicken_makhani which is a tomato based curry with herbs and spices
perhaps a little too spicy if you can't tolerate any heat
but for me it was perfect
my husband had the lamb_vindaloo
i tried it and it was a little too hot for me
but it was pretty damn good i must say
we found our server to be pleasant and attentive
i'm sorry we didn't go sooner
actually we tried
but they close between lunch and dinner
as they are moving their scottsdale location to hayden via de ventura
somehow i think we'll make the extra effort to go again
but i will attempt to avoid the belly_dancing i've got more than enough belly of my own

yelpers jim w and audrey w were reportedly seen enjoying lively conversation and delicious indian food with donald s and carin s
witnesses claim the group was laughing loudly at times
one bystander reported
that was a guffaw
that outburst right there was definitely a guffaw
wild stuff
sources have related to this publication that the group dined on two appetizers
one known as a bread basket which consisted of four types of naan_bread
jim w was overheard to say
i really like the onion naan
the other appetizer may have been aloo_tikki
this has not been confirmed as yet
in any case the plate containing the reported aloo_tikki was cleaned by the foursome
several even going so far as to swab at the remaining sauce on the plate
the above sources also reported that the table was served an order of the friday daily special of kahari shrimp
it was overheard by a nearby table that the shrimp was
flavorful with strong notes of garlic and ginger
this has not substantiated
however
audrey w reportedly was served the lamb_korma which she was rumored to have noted was
yummy
carin s apparently was served the chicken masala and donald s may have been served some sort of vindaloo that included potato
it seems there was considerable sharing of the dishes around the table and the main_dishes may have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was a basmati_rice with various herbs and spices
an unnamed source has informed this publication that while jim w claims to have particularly enjoyed the food and festive atmosphere which included a belly_dancer and some swordplay
he was displeased with the excessive sound level produced by the in house sound system and even requested that the music be reduced
jim w's blog had a statement this morning that read
in part
ears haven't hurt the next morning like that since my last rock concert
i really liked the food but i wouldn't go back on a night when they have dancing again
this place has really bad service
we waited for over minutes just to get our drink_orders taken
then another minutes to get our food order taken
then over an_hour to get food
the food is okay i've had better indian food in the valley
the atmosphere is also weird they have this belly_dancer
who has bit too much belly
the owner walks around whistling and putting dollar bills in the belly dancer's top
really bizarre
so not appropriate for families
all in all
there's better food
service
and places to go for authentic_indian_food
i've been twice and both times were very disappointing due to poor quality food and service
there won't be a third time
i'll never go back again
i am remiss in not writing my review of our dinner tandoori_times a little sooner
in my defense
my ears hadn't stopped ringing from the background music for the belly_dancer and i was unable to concentrate on the screen long enough to write a coherent sentence
at least i think that's why i can't write a coherent sentence
the beautiful carin and i met the utterly delightful jim and audrey w
for dinner at tandoori_times last friday_evening
i keep saying it
but one of the things i like about yelp is actually meeting and getting to know real people in
meat world
as opposed to only getting to know someone online
it really gets down to the art of dining
pleasant conversation with convivial company
good food and drink
in an interesting setting
we had all of those things friday_evening
and more
we also had indian food at tandoori_times
i love indian and pakistani food
i play squash and i got to know indian and pakistani food from the kitchens of the wives of some of my squash buddies
incredible meals and incredible hospitality
we could all take lessons
we started with cocktails
kinds of naan
the onion naan was incredible
crusty and crunchy on the outside
literally filled with chunks of soft
savory sweet roasted onion
appetizers included aloo_tikki
a potato pancake with gravy
and you know how much i like gravy
good stuff
we passed things around
family_style
we ordered dinner as we enjoyed our conversations
it was great to get to know jim and audrey better and i'm glad we had some time to chat as dinner was served
really wonderful food
chicken_vindaloo
chicken masala
lamb_korma and kahari shrimp
everything perfectly prepared
spicy and flavorful
the service was warm and friendly
all of the food was served family_style with rice and more naan to sop up the gravies and sauces
so good
then came the belly_dancing and music
there may also have been a fire engine parade and a boeing landing in the parking_lot
it was so loud we'll never really know
the sound system was really cranked for the lovely belly_dancer and it was fun to watch her for the first minutes or so
but after an_hour or so
the fun of watching belly_dancing kind of wore off
we wanted to get back to conversation
even though the belly_dancer was brandishing swords and candles
it was a little like watching nascar
you don't want to see the wreck
but you don't want to miss it either
i'm happy to report that nothing was cut off or burned during the performance
sadly
conversation was rendered nearly impossible by the fact that someone had turned the amplifiers up to
jim would ask me
what do you do for a living
and i would answer
i sold my motorcycle in
with a smile
and he would look puzzled
audrey and carin were having similar difficulties
it's just hard to have quiet chat when the background music is up around decibels
that said
we truly enjoyed the evening with our new friends
and we really enjoyed the food at tandoori_times
i just recommend calling ahead to ask about the belly_dancing
and bring the ear plugs if you go on belly_dancing nights
long holiday weekend
sunday_afternoon around
we finally found the place for lunch it's part of a
or so
building complex wrapped around the back
ok
so we go in
it is completely empty of customers
nice bar to the left with about people who seem to work there but we were ignored for a few minutes till someone notices us and says
oh you can sit anywhere
so we do
we get water immediately
then a wait of about more minutes in an empty room
while the keep on talking
till someone else
our server
arrives with more water and menus
other than that it was ok
we had the tandoori wraps very good
the rest of the menu looked worth trying
evidently they are getting a new menu june
interesting concept of a card that you get cash back on your food totals ask about it
the only other thing worth mentioning is that it would be nice if raita
even plain yogurt
was free on request
is a lot for it
even if you get a lot more than needed
and they were out of the oz kingfisher bottles
ryan
our server
was very nice
interesting decor
indian but not cheesy
funny sidebar about a group of
highly tattooed
who had never eaten indian food before and were given quite a thorough introduction
always glad to have my stereotypes challenged
give it a try
the atlanta yelp empress
kathleen m
came to town this week to help out with the yelp rocks event
so since she's a fan of ethnic cuisine
i decided we'd try tandoori_times
it is kind of hidden in the shopping_center i suggest they get some better signage
but we're smart girls
and we found it
it looked pretty dead from the outside but once we were led to a table
we saw a few other parties dining
including some friends of mine on a date
while our service was attentive enough
our waiter kept attempting to talk us out of what we wanted to order and tried to sell us something different
for example
when we ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
he suggested we order chicken chile instead
no thanks
and when we ordered the bengun bhartha
eggplant_dish
he suggested something else too
we stuck to our guns though
we were girls that knew what we wanted
in addition to the dishes above
we shared a house salad
rice
and a tandoori roti
whole_wheat bread made in the tandoor oven
we would've ordered an appetizer of sorts
ie
samosas
but you have to do that during certain times of the day and we missed our window for that
kind of odd
huh
nonetheless
i enjoyed everything although i added a lot of hot_sauce it didn't have much kick without it
gotta love that hot_sauce
i really enjoy indian food and don't eat it as often as i'd like
it seems that many people are not up for adventurous eating
i don't get it
regardless
i'd come back to tandoori_times in a heartbeat
it didn't knock my socks off but it was a pleasant experience with attentive service
decent ambiance
and moderate prices
thanks to kathleen m for trying something new with me
i visited this restaurant for the first time last week
i can say that everything we had was great
i really liked our server
a young girl
or
who knew the menu so well and who also told us of some special dishes not yet on the menu that we could order
we took her advice on all of her suggestions
and they were delicious
it made dinner that much better to try_new_things and be pleasantly_surprised
an indian coworker of mine who was craving a little chicken_tikka_masala suggested that we check_this_place_out after yelping it
so we headed over one night after work
it was a little hard_to_find as others have mentioned
but we got there in the end
so no harm
no foul
a lot of my recent indian food experiences have been in strip malls
which are about as disasterous as they sound
so i was so thrilled to be able to go
sit_down and enjoy my indian food properly
and enjoy it
i did
my coworkers and i started_off_with the bread basket
which our waiter kindly let us mix n' match
we weren't thrilled about the wheat naan
so he let us switch it out for an extra helping of the onion
garlic or plain_naan
yippee
all of the naans were great
the onion was probably the one that thrilled me the least
but it's hard to go wrong with naan of any variety
so needless_to_say that when our food was gone
the naan was as well
for our entrees
we ended_up going family_style and sharing four dishes
for three people
the chicken_biryani
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_makhani and lamb_vindaloo
they were all great
i would order any of them again
but
if i had to choose my favorite
it would be the chicken_makhani
i really appreciate that they use white
good quality chicken
one of the keys to great indian food
in my opinion
the chicken_tikka_masala was also wonderful as well
but spicier than the makhani
as for the lamb_vindaloo and the chicken_biryani
they didn't do it for me quite like the first two but i really have no complaints about them
and devoured them in no time
the service wasn't super quick
but we'll_be_back
after a great meal
we all agreed that this place could easily become a weekly dining excursion
especially since they have frequent diner cards
every time you're there
they put a certain percentage of what you spend on the card
and then you can use it on any future meal
that's fabulous
it's like free money
what's not to love
my wife doesn't like very hot spicy food
she enjoys indian food and wherever we have lived in the past we have found great indian_restaurants able to make her dishes without all the kick
we went here to check it out and she ordered chicken_tikka_masala and couldn't eat it because of how spicy it was
the manager told her he couldn't make it less potent or else the taste would be sacraficed
well
how did the other indian_restaurants outside of phoenix manage to do it
not impressed at all with this place and won't be going back
gabi k was sweet enough to cater to my indian cravings and we ventured out to tandoori_times on my never ending quest for quality chicken_tikka_masala
as we scanned the menu
i was disappointed to see that a large portion of their options were only available during lunch time
get separate menus so i'm happily oblivious to what i'm missing
i am a chicken_tikka_masala girl through and through
while i may order other dishes in addition to ctm
i have to get it at every indian_joint i go to
yes
yes
i know it may not be the most authentic thing
but i don't care
i love it
so don't you dare try to talk me out of it
and that's exactly what our waiter did
which made me nervous
was the ctm all that bad
no
it was fair
but the waiter's attempt to lead us down a different road makes me wonder if they really do have wonderful food here
it's just not ctm
try it out
and go with their recommendations
yay
i am a big_fan
i am obsessed with their chicken_makhani
aaahhh the naan is always so good i prefer the plain
so happy they serve samosas anytime now
i haven't found better indian food anywhere in phoenix
man
when my ex bf used to work there he would always bring home the best food
i love their channa_masala and lamb saag
they also have some of the best naan around
if you do get dessert
the ghulab jamen is insanely sweet
but their kheer hits the spot
was fully craving indian
and was fortunate enough to be directed here by a few friends that have recently moved to the states from india
can't stress enough how good this place is
complex flavors and delicious sauces
service was great
portions were solid and price was right on
and
if you like spicy
you're in luck
go for 'chef hot'
they don't hold back
definitely part of the regular rotation moving forward
we dropped a party of on them
last minute
not too far from closing time and the service was amazing
the server was excellent
her suggestions were right on
and she even offered to take a dish back when she noticed one person in the party was surprised by the spiciness of her dish
this person didn't complain_about the dish
the server just noticed the look on her face and offered to take it back
zeeeeee food
so good
so
good
i would give this place stars
but i did not have a chance to have any appetizers and rate them with the whole meal
so it's my fault
i will just have to go back and edit my review
fin
i went to tandoori_times today for lunch with six of my co_workers for lunch
it was not the best indian food i've had
but it was definitely not the worst
i had the achari lamb lunch_special
but my experience there was horrible
my issue with tandoori_times was the service
our waitress did not seem to care about our table at all
even though we were the largest party in the place
maybe she felt that she did not need to work for her tip since it was automatically added to our bill
she never checked on us to see if we needed anything
one of our party members even had to chase her down just find out where his food was after everyone else's food had shown up minutes before
she had issues with our check and stiffed us on our change
i bill was
three people put in
another a
and three people asked her to charge a piece on their credit cards
that totals
we asked for change from the cash
she came back with no change and walked away
as we were already minutes late from lunch and were in a hurry we left
but she swiped a
tip
even though the food was good
the service was the worst i think i've ever had
i will_not_be_returning to this restaurant any time soon
finally in north scottsdale
a great indian place
our friend who grew_up in london recommended t t and we wern't disappointed
the best lamb saag i've had and our friend always gets the tiki_masala
excellent service and happy_hour drink prices before pm
my question is where is the garlic in
garlic_naan
badger out
its hard for me to give this restaurant a higher star_rating
this is not due to the food by_any_means
the food is excellent and very genuine
i do however
take issue with the service
everyone is pleasant enough
but none of the wait_staff or take out order employees seem to have any concept of time
i have dined in at the restaurant for lunch a couple_of_times with other colleagues
we have a typical hour lunch break and this establishment is a mere mins away
lets just say both times we told the server we would be in a hurry due to work and both times we were at least to minutes late
lesson learned
so we resorted to calling in our order for pick_up
we were told it would be ready in mins
that was a sheer fabrication as both times we arrived and paid and waited for another minutes for our food at the pick_up window
aka bar
now
why do we keep giving them another chance
well
that's simple
it is the only authentic_indian_food in a mile radius
trust_me
if we had other options we'd take them
bottom_line
great food
crap service
hard place to find
but fairly delicious and affordable
my friends and i go here
we like it
i love_this_place
every time i have a craving_for_indian_food this is where i go
even though i now live about minutes from here
the service is always great
and the food
oh it is wonderful
i usually order the chicken_tikka mahsala
or the chicken mahkni
they are both so good
i also love their naan
i've been to a few other indian restaraunts in the valley
al of which were claimed to be
the best indian food in phoenix
but this truely is the best in phoenix
service
food
cleanliness
atmosphere
value
pros
great atmosphere
good first time indian food
this wont knock over you friends new to the cuisine
cons
difficult to locate
slow kitchen
pricey
ungodly uncomfortable booths
dishes worth the calories
garlic onion naan
saag_paneer
chicken_tikka_masala
full review
well all the indian reviews from the buffay crew finally got to me and i had to have it for a cheat meal
was like mr toads wild ride in my truck getting here
a quick u turn
brake check
sharp right
up a ramp and into a parking place
that complex is like a maze and i feel lucky that i located my destination
walked in the yelp stickered door and was hit with that delicious indian restaurant smell
what was lacking was the scent of mesquite which you can usually pick_up at most places from the tandoor
this was an upclass place so i figured it was just vented well
the place was really cool on the inside having this upscale lounge type feel
nice and dim and easy on the eyes
the guy who was double duty as host waiter seemed a bit annoyed that i was walking in the door at
when they were open until
a tad on the snooty side asked if i was picking_up or eating in with a heavy insinuation that i better be picking_up
luckily i was saved by my phone going off as my friend couldn't find the place
i got to bark two for dinner and walked out the door to find my friend
was happy when our waitress came to the table since i didn't want much to do with the host
she took our drink order and asked if we needed a few more minutes to which i made the mistake of replying yes
normally i have these meals pre planned and know exactly what i want but this was a last minute change of destination
i regretted not ordering right then because we didn't see her again for a long while
my friends have learned that i usually know what's good and just let me order for the table
one of them was an appetizer and as usual i was asked if i wanted that first or with the meal
i try and condense the time that i'm eating bad food to limit the sugar spikes it might create
i'm not even sure why they ask because out of times they bring it first anyway
this was one of those times
we waited for what seemed like an eternity for this one dish to show up
at that point i just started eating because i was super hungry
the rest took another minutes to get there
kitchen here is realllly slow and we were one of only tables
one more note
do yourself a favor and get a table
the booths here are horrible
they press you forward into the table and are very uncomfortable on the back after a while
and you will be there a while
p
food details
onion_bhaji
i ordered these thinking they were something different
they were basically battered onion strings with what i would guess was a plum based sauce
i was expecting the indian fritters that i couldn't remember_the_name of at the time
it was still tasty
bread basket
sampler of different_types_of naan
the only ones i would recommend are the onion and garlic
in the rest the texture was a little different but no flavor profile change and rather dull
chicken_tikka_masala
mmmm i love this dish and it was pretty darn good here
i have had better but it wasn't in the valley
i haven't chowed on much indian since returning here many years_ago
saag_paneer
texturally this was way off from what i'm used to
it was almost like a ground spinach
the spice profile of the dish was excellent but i was a little disappointed in the paneer
this isn't a strong cheese anyway but this really had no flavor to it
i'm used to it adding at least a creamy richness to the dish
this one had the taste texture of firm tofu
tandoori_chicken
i was really craving some tandoori_chicken and i was disappointed
it wasn't bad but it lacked the bold flavor depth this dish usually has
i also totally missed any mesquite wood smoke flavor that should have been there
between the lack of wood taste and smell i think this place may use a gas driven tandoori verses a real mesquite charcoal version
kheer
rice_pudding is great stuff and adding almonds and raisins to it
yum
this is where someone played a cruel joke on us
the dessert glass was an odd shape and the spoon didn't fit all the way
if you wanted to retain your manners there was of the dessert you were unable to reach
manners were tossed out the window
i agree fully with the stars this place has averaged for itself
i made the mistake of trusting some friends over trusting yelp
i could have done much better that night but this was a ok and tamed the craving
we felt very rushed towards the end of the dinner to pay and get a move on
we were there in plenty of time to eat and leave before closing had this place operated at a normal pace
just remember
if your friends had good taste
they would be yelpers
one of my favorite indian_restaurants
i have a half dozen indian coworkers and it is also one of their favorites
lunch typically has a plate of salad
rice
bread
orders diverge depending_on main_dish based_on lamb
chicken
or vegetables
plus a bowl of a lentil soup
been there once for dinner with a group_of_people
food was served indian family_style and kept coming until everybody had enough
outdoor seating is nice
before weather turns to hellacious
and is well away from traffic although a little too close to a large parking_lot
still very nice
food is great
service is not so great
if you can handle waiting for a while for your food
water
and the check
then this place is good
ambience is okay not really fancy
but the food is good
they have a belly_dancer on weekend nights
which is interesting
a bit weird actually and it's loud so you can't hear very well if you want to converse with your own dinner party
i was excited_to_try tandoori_times as good indian good food can be hard to come by here in arizona
i was even more encouraged when i walked in and found an almost exclusively indian
appearing
clientele
to begin
the service was a little off
there was maybe people in the restaurant yet we waited a full five minutes or so for a greeting
when he did come by
he asked if we were ready to order and i looked at him and said
you know
we might need to look at the menus first
perhaps he's used to
regulars
anyway
we began with the onion_bhaji
essentially an indian version of onion rings
and raita
a cucumber
potato
mint and yogurt_sauce
the onion_bhaji looked good in all its fried glory
but was so heavily battered my wife and i both felt ill after trying a few pieces
you could not taste the onion at all
major disaster
the waiter began to redeem himself by noticing that we had hardly touched it and offered to take it off the menu
the raita was fresh and flavorful but didn't exactly fit with anything we ordered and a recommendation of what to eat it with would have been helpful
we also ordered the naan and simply put it was killer hot
light
wonderful
first score at tandoori_times
my wife ordered the chicken_makhani and one sampling of the sauce had us both oohing and ahhing at its rich
buttery flavor
nothing to say here again but killer
i ordered the lamb_korma
and though i found the dish to be decent
it was just very plain when compared_to_other indian dishes i have had that just burst with varied bold flavors
i also asked that it come spicy
out of
but instead it came with no spice at all
while my wife's dish came pretty hot and was supposed_to_be mild
i wouldn't order again but it may be right up someone else's alley
finally
we ordered a plate of rice to accompany our meals
the rice looked and tasted like it had been sitting around since yesterday
and maybe it was
my wife grew_up on rice and loves it more than she loves me
so when she frowns at the sight and scowls at the taste of the rice
it is bad rice
i could justify giving tandoori_times less than three stars but something tells me another visit may render us happier customers
i'll try it again
but only one more time before i chalk it up to
just another indian place
where the food and service simply fall short
the food was excellent
the lamb chop appetizer was incredibly flavorful
although it was a little gristly
the bhindi_masala is among the better bhindi dishes i've had
i still can't place the extra spice they put in it
the saag ghosht was superb
just really an excellent lamb dish
tender lamb and mildly spicy spinach gravy
and of course the chicken_tikka_masala was solid
and tt serves gajrela
an indian carrot pudding
it's been a few years since i've had gajrela
i still love it
service was friendly and speedy
the belly_dancing with the sword was unexpected
my only concern with tt is that if that was its saturday_night rush
then i hope they are making it up during lunch
the place was only full
my wife and i were looking for a good indian restaurant in scottsdale and came across tandoori_times thanks to yelp
the reviews were positive
service was question mark
we were prepared for the wait
we went on sat
night at
and sat right down
we were well fed and walking out in just about an_hour
the service was friendly and great
the garlic and onion naan were great as recommended
so was the chicken_tikka_masala and lamb saag
we are locals and like some spice in our food
we are used to ordering spicy mexican and it being just right
we did the same here
wow
they meant it
loved it
but had a nice sweat going
we were told after that mild is a on spice meter
what we had was out of
you might try mild first trip
i did not give stars due to that being a rare mark
for off the chart experience
like the old sea saw or binkley's
we left with a great dinner experience and a take out menu
we will go back
maybe mild next time
maybe i was lucky
maybe i was just too desperate for a good indian meal
i don't know
but my experience here was fabulous
i can't in good conscience give it a star_rating because i know of better places in ca
but on a scale of 'phoenix area' indian places
this would get a star_rating no problem
i've been looking for a good indian place for over a year
and i saw this place over a year_ago
but decided it was too 'fancy'
and could not rationalize a good indian place in such an upscale
suburban setting
so i kept passing it up
in the meantime
i've been to mesa
tempe
and chandler in search of the solution
most times
i don't even walk in the door
i'm sorry
but as a lone diner
i'm not interested in being the only patron at pm
plus what does that tell you about the food if no one is there
i walked into tt at
pm on a friday_night and it was busy
that was a big plus
and most of the patrons looked indian another big plus
for some reason i'd gotten it into my head that this was a fancy spot
but in fact
the interior is simply 'nicely done'
head and shoulders above most indian places for sure
but definitely not stuffy or over fancy
many people have mentioned the incredibly slow service
my waiter is maybe a yelp reader
because he told me
these tandoori appetizers shouldn't be called appetizers
they should say
' minutes to cook'
he suggested i get my tandoori appetizer at the same time as my main_dish good advice
i had the goat_curry
which was outstanding
and the tandoori lamb_chops which was not perfect way more pieces than i imagined
but thinly sliced
and not as juicy as i had hoped
the rice was absolutely perfect basmati_rice with some whole cloves dotted throughout
the naan_bread was also perfect really
really perfect
and made the meal a perfect treat
just as my meal arrived
boom
the music got loud and out jumped
a belly_dancer
this was not what i was in the mood for
and at first i felt the evening was ruined
but she was good
and really 'worked the crowd' as it were
and made an effort to engage everyone
some tables got up and danced with her
leading to a rather festive atmosphere
overall
a plus
but i'm glad it was only one reasonably short session
in summary good food
nice place
nice_atmosphere
and head and shoulders above anything else i've found in the phoenix metro so far
eastern edge i don't get over to the west
i have eaten there a couple_of_times
nice
friendly_staff
good reasonably_priced food
one time i ordered a meal that was so hot
spicy
it was almost uncomfortable to finish eating
other than that
good experience
great food
loved the chicken curry
although relatively low on spices to tone it down a little
it had all the flavors that i would get back in india
was completely surprised with the belly dance
was pretty neat and a nice show
overall excellent food and really close to authentic
would love to come back
this is definitely the best indian restaurant in phoenix
the tandoori_chicken and aloo_tikki wraps are to die for
you cannot go wrong with this place
after my first good experience
i've been back at least times
each time
the food has been awesome
the friday special 'goat curry' is great
and the saturday special beef stew is also great
the rice and naan are always perfect
and the condiment they bring out with the papadums
a ginger based pickle
is fabulous
the service one night was laughably bad really
really bad
and other nights
not perfect
but the atmosphere
decor
and food make it a real discovery
good food
we have had a lot of indian food in montreal and in the uk
this one is above_average by international standard s
the service though is a bit disorganized and i would the belly_dancer and the loud music for something more quaint
but overall worth repeat visits
the food here is delicious
goa prawn curry
tandoori_chicken
lamb_tikka_masala
garlic_naan
tandoori shrimp app
cocktail samosa app
lamb seekh kabob app
slow service
but that's how most of the indian_restaurants i know are
authentic
salty
tamarind_chutney on point
my boss took me out to lunch here once
and i was very pleasantly_surprised at the flavor and price of the lunch_specials
mostly everything i have tried at tandoori_times has been good
the naan is so fresh and warm
and when you request spicy
that's what you get
enter the mango_lassi
which is really good
it helps cool your mouth when you're eating something fiery
the only thing i have a complaint about are the tandoori appetizer wings
as there was less meat on them than i have seen on any chicken wing
plus it was way too spicy
i also felt_like was way too much to ask when you have to basically get your nutrition from the dish by sucking on bones
but
hey
who am i to judge
right
had they toned the flavor just a bit on that dish
i might have given it another try
however
bleeding from my esophagus is not how i'd like to spend my lunch hour
aside from the wings from hell
i love tandoori_times
it is authentic
affordable and right around the corner from my job
stars
love_this_place
very beautiful decorations
and they have belly_dancing on friday nights
very reasonably_priced considering the ingredients that it takes to make indian food
the only thing i didn't like about their dinners is that you have to order the rice separate from the entree
but still very good
try the samosas
thoroughly impressed with this place
we were in for dinner on a wednesday and the dining_area was crowded and vibrant
the decor is better than average for an indian restaurant
the service was superb and he was honest with his opinions
he told us not to order a certain dish
the food was awesome and the complimentary chai_tea warmed me on the cold night
i strongly recommend_this_place
not too expensive considering the location
my friend suggested that we start our saturday_night here before heading out to other halloween festivities
besides feeling completely out of place in our halloween costumes we had a great time
it's a pretty low key place and it sits towards the back of this shopping complex so unless you know where you're going you would never find it
we had a great experience since my friend personally knows one of the owners
we sat on the patio and started_off_with drinks and hookah and we were given some great suggestions for food
i decided to go for the chili prawns and garlic_naan and a side of the basmati and saffron rice
i'm still drooling thinking about this food
it was so fresh and flavorful
i couldn't stop_eating
the sauce the prawns came in
man was it tasty
after hookah
drinks and this delish food my girls and i got up danced a bit with the resident belly_dancer inside of the restaurant
overall it was a great experience
we felt_like we were part of the family
great service
great ambiance and perfect for dates or family night
if i lived closer i would definitely be a regular
we started with aloo_tikki
it was good but i don't like one of the spices in the garbanzo beans
the aloo_tikki last week in west palm
fla
was infinitely better
i had chicken_korma which again had that taste i am not too keen on
similar to nutmeg or cloves
which i have not noticed in any korma i have ever had previously
the korma sauce was very thick and i liked it but it was much thicker than the usual korma sauce in most other places and although it was good and certainly quite different
i think i prefer the usual consistency
but it is nice to have something different for a change
the onion naan was possibly a little underdone and slightly doughy
though it too was good and i suspect it was not so much underdone as that this is the way it is served at this restaurant
what was over was taken home and certainly thoroughly_enjoyed the next day so it's fair to say i would recommend this restaurant
my chief complaint would be the noise
when we walked in we were pleased to see that there were many indian customers
always a good sign in an indian restaurant
but it was noisy and the most noise came from a crying baby
this is not the baby's fault i wish people with very young children would have the decency to do what i did when my kids were young
leave them at home
many people say that if you can't afford to leave at least a tip then you can't afford to eat out
i think if you can't afford to find a babysitter so you can enjoy your evening and in particular so you can not spoil the evening for others
then please stay home
as usual
the people with the baby were impervious to its crying
they were obviously so accustomed to it that it does not bother them
i am not sure whether to hold this against the restaurant
they could have asked the people to take the baby outside until it settled
but it was cold outside and i wouldn't want to make them do that to the kid
it's a difficult situation for the resaurant but if i go again and the same thing happens again i will mark it down as a family restaurant and keep away when i don't want to deal with the noise of babies crying
ate lunch there after about a two mile walk from the hyatt at gainey ranch
very good food
reasonable_prices and a lunch menu with various specials for each day of the week
complementary chai
waitress was very pleasant and helpful
the restaurant was quite clean as were the bathrooms
would recommend
lunch menu choices were limited to six entrees
this was the first indian restaurant i have ever been to
as it was recommended by some friends
they do have belly_dancer on saturdays
which definitely was not part of my plan for the evening
the music was extremely loud and annoying
since we were sitting right below the speakers playing obnoxiously loud music
we asked to be moved to a different table
which did not help
fortunately it only lasted a couple more songs
they do offer variety of naans in the menu
and i asked if we can have a platter to try different versions
and the waiter said they do not offer platter type assorted naans
pretty annoying as time went by and i saw that they do offer a platter with variety of naans
i guess my fault
i should of read the multi page menu
i wish they had pictures in the menu
which will help if not familiar with the cuisine
we ordered the yellow curry and chicken wrap
chicken wrap was just a wrap
nothing special
yellow curry was cold
not even room temperature
but cold
wasn't too happy about it
prices_are_reasonable
can't expect more
i really liked the variety of spices in the rice
definitely new to me
i really liked this place
the only reason i didn't give it stars was the waiter
who was extremely nice
was a bit inattentive
we had to wave him over quite a few times
the staff was extremely friendly
the music was nice and ambient
not too loud at all
i went on a weeknight
when there is no belly_dancer or loud music
the food was really good
and this is coming from a picky eater who is not a huge_fan_of indian food
the dessert was awesome
and overall
for the enormous amount we ordered for people
i have plenty of leftovers
the price was fairly good
i was surprised at how low the check was
i will
say
though
it was a little hard_to_find
it's off in the back corner of the complex
go with the lamb lunch_special here
chicken is also acceptable
you_will_not_be_disappointed
indian food is not my favorite but i think this is the best place for it in scottsdale
i really love their chicken_tikka_masala
i also think they have great naan and i like that they have a variety of flavors
excellent chai_tea which is free and unlimited
they have lunch_specials
which is also nice
or you can order anything off the dinner menu all day but you will have to split it with someone because the portions are huge
last_night i craved indian food and logged on to yelp for help
my very favorite place is miles away and i wanted something nearby
i found tandoori_times and arrived there at pm
i couldn't believe that at pm there were people ahead of us waiting for a table
a good sign
i thought or
poor management that can't_handle a crowd
someone who appeared_to_be the owner was busy working to see that everyone got a table quickly
we got a table in minutes in a small room they have in the rear of the restaurant
within minutes we got a waitress and placed our order
she brought us condiments
a red spicy sauce
coriander chili sauce and a spicy sauce made with marinated ginger bits
no papadums
most restaurants give you papadums
we missed them
my order of chicken_vindaloo was absolutely delightful spiced just as i requested hot
our double order of bread came hot and delish
we don't eat rice
my husband's lamb tikka was generous and nicely done
during our meal
the belly_dancer started her act
this meant that the loud music would soon begin
and i mean loud
i don't know if it was that we were in that small room
but my eardrums were about to burst
there was no relief until we ended our meal
the belly_dancer could not be seen from our room so we stood up to peek at what was going on
it was an attractive young lady
dressing in belly_dancing garb dancing to indian pop music
not really belly_dancing
i've done belly_dancing myself
next
dessert
i ordered the kheer
it was absolutely_amazing
it was creamy with sliced almonds and raisins
probably one of the best i've had anywhere
i gave tandoori_times stars because the music was too loud and it kind of spoiled the experience for us
other than that the food is really authentic and delicious
i hope that the management will consider toning down the music at least for the poor people in the back room
i would never accept a seat in that room when i return
and
i will return
service was good
food was good
the dancing and music was atrocious
i couldnt enjoy the food due to the ridiculous music volume
other than that
pretty good
they were nice when they brought out my birthday cake
i have been a regular for years and i really like the place
but last_night was a disaster from start to finish
the waiter had no business being a waiter
the food took quite a while and came out lukewarm
all of it
the main_dishes
the rice and the nan
i made them aware and they brought back another round of dishes they claimed to be fresh
not just original dishes heated up
same temperature and virtually no spiciness
we are usually asked how spicy we like our food
the waiter never bothered to ask us
it was as if the place changed ownership and the new team was that day trying to figure_out how to cook and run a restaurant
i made management aware and received off the bill
still not sure when or if i'll be back
great indian food
much better than usual indian places coming from an indian
stars for good food but crappy service
i was raised on indian food
and know what i like
i heard that tandoori_times was a great restaurant
so my boyfriend and i decided to eat there a few weeks back
i had been looking for a new indian restaurant and was excited_to_try it out
the restaurant was busy
and we waited about minutes until a table was available
we were seated on the patio behind a pillar
bad idea
our server came over after a few minutes to take our drink order
he came back with our drinks
and we were unsure as to what we wanted to order for dinner but we ordered the aloo_tikki to start
the appetizer took a long time to come out
about minutes
and our server didn't come back to take our order until shortly before our appetizer arrived
we ordered the bengun bhartha and chicken curry with garlic_naan
another or so minutes went by after we were finished with our appetizer before we saw our server again
he set our dishes down and asked if we wanted anything else
i asked if we could have a side of rice because i just guessed that he had forgotten it
or it was on its way as all indian places i have been to serve rice as an accompaniment to dishes
i told my boyfriend i didn't want to eat my meal without rice
so i waited about minutes
no rice
our server continued serve other tables and walk away before my boyfriend could flag him down
finally
i decided to not let the already mildly cool food get colder
so i reluctantly began eating
the curry tasted great and was well spiced
i also loved the bengun bhartha
i have only found one place that makes it the way i like it
after we were done eating the two dishes
the server finally came over
no rice in hand
to ask how our meal was
my boyfriend politely asked for boxes
our rice to go
since they seemed to be still cooking it
and the check
we waited another or so minutes to get our bill
and the server says
don't worry_about the rice
it's on me
what
we actually have to pay extra for rice
my boyfriend got up and went looking for the manager
he spoke to the hostess and found out the manager had stepped away
but she called and spoke to him
my boyfriend explained our experience
and how it was our first time dining there
the manager said that we would either wait for him to return
or the hostess could take off our bill
not wanting to wait any longer for anything else
my boyfriend just asked for the discount
the food was great
but the service was crap
absolute crap
unfortunately
due to that first impression
i don't want to go back
this is the only india restaurant in az that doesn't disappoint
we have been there a few times and the seekh kababs and chicken_tikka have always been excellent
the food takes a while to come out
but then it is fresh food
fresh food takes time
the service is good
went there with kids once not realizing that they have belly_dancing that was embarrassing
take out food has been disappointing as well
now we always dine in
avoid weekends
and make sure we have plenty of time to wait for enjoy the good food
i bought some frozen indian entrees from sunflower market and it reminded_me_of the time i ate here
my boyfriend's parents were in town for spring break this year and i had been wanting_to_try this place out for quite some time
so the four of us grabbed an early dinner after watching the a's beat the white sox
i should have known it was going to be a poor experience when we drove up and saw how
fancy
the outside was
our waiter was rude
and when taking our order he dropped the
empty
tray once
there were only a couple of other tables with people at them
so it was pretty loud
when our food came
the waiter dropped my plate on the table
and my food got all over the table
my shirt
and even my purse
he brought me napkins a few minutes_later so i could clean up his mess
and dropped his empty tray yet again
it took him forever to bring us the bill
or extra naan
or anything we ordered
each time we waited
i looked over at the bar and he was just standing around drumming his fingers
the food was very bland
even with a ton of heat spice
the blandness overpowered everything
my boyfriend's mom is not picky at all
but she could not eat her food
the only reason i'd even give this place one star is the mango_lassi was delicious
the naan was good
and my boyfriend and his father really enjoyed their huge taj mahal's
i give up
i once loved the food and service here but both have deteriorated to the point of no return
at least my return
once you get past the lackluster service you get mutter_paneer with peas tasting like they just came out of a can and chicken_tika_masala so bland i didn't ask for cartons for the leftovers
serving the tika_masala at near room temperature didn't do it any favors
go find indian paradise in the airpark
while they don't have belly_dancers they have cricket on the tv and truly terrific indian food
having been a big_fan of tandoori_times when it was in old town
i expected the same quality at this location
and was somewhat disappointed
we were there just after opening on a sunday
there was only one other table occupied
yet service was pretty poor
undoubtedly the kitchen was extremely slow
but the server was not much better
as for the food
same great flavor i remember for the most part
the chicken_vindaloo should have been called potato vindaloo
however
very little chicken was to be found
also
the garlic on the naan was extremely bitter
as the naan was slightly charred
i assume the garlic had slightly burned
the price point on both the naan and rice seemed a little high
i believe it was
for the naan and a similar amount for a small cup of rice
charging for rice seems overkill here
the entrees are not that cheap to begin with
it's the old charging for chips salsa debate i guess
overall
an average meal
but i'm hoping it was an off day
will try again sometime
this place is a rare find in the heart of scottsdale
if you love delicious indian
great service
lively ambiance
then you'll fall in love with td just as i have
my favorite dishes are the chicken_tikka_marsala
lamb_vindaloo
paneer makhani
and their garlic_naan
the best naan i've ever tasted
if you enjoy super spicy
make sure you request the chef's spicy
you may be disappointed if you don't request extra_spicy
every friday and saturday the exotic spicy cuisine is paired with its spicy
exotic belly_dancers
i highly_recommend checking this hidden_gem out
i concur with a lot of these reviewers
food is great and reasonably_priced but the service does not invite you to return
my date and i were sat in a tiny back room to sit by ourselves
they should have let us know that was the only available table and asked if it was okay
the belly_dancer enjoyed dancing
but it was obvious she didn't enjoy doing this in front of people
she has the power to set the tone of your dining_experience
but she hopped around without giving any eye contact and seemed to rush by the tables and didn't step foot into our room
when ordering
the server provided no help in making a decision
his response was as if everything was mediocre
he was not excited about what he was selling
next time
i'll do take out
i fell in love with indian food after going to this place
i go there on all my
special occasions
birthdays
holidays
last year i even went for valentines day
the food there is so unique good
i end up getting different meals just so i can keep trying new dishes
the tandoori_chicken is my_favorite_dish
they also have this mango drink that is amazing
i have to have one every time i go
such a yummy place to eat
gosh even writing this review makes me want to go again
it doesn't get much better if_you're_looking for good food
great food
avoid the booths they are the most uncomfortable seating i have ever experienced
loud as hell
they couldn't hear anything over the phone so i just went in person and that was even worse
kids jumping off benches
everyone on staff seemed pissed off and stressed out
no host hostess so if you walk in you will stand there totally ignored forever unless you grab someone in passing
this happened to me and everyone who walked in the whole time i was there
the menus had scribbles and dried food on them
it's all pretty pricey on top of that but at least the food was good
not worth putting up with the rest of that bullshit though
guess i'll just have to stick with the frozen indian entrees and naan from trader joe's
really great naan
have only had fish and veg dishes but never had a dish that wasn't really good
my husband and i went there for lunch on a sunday
the food itself was good but the service was indifferent
many indian_restaurants bring out some complimentary papadams before even ordering
no such luck here
pretty much the only thing that was free was the water and condiments
we tried this out after having had good luck at a couple other indian_restaurants in the area
we will_be_going_back to those places and not returning to tandoori_times
this was our first time going to tandoori_times
the atmosphere was pleasant and i thought it would be more crowded than it was
the good
the food
food was great
i had the goat_curry which was their friday special
and it was wonderful
my husband who doesn't like most curry dishes stuck with the tandoori_chicken which was wonderful as well
a side of pesto naan rounded the meal out
no complaints about the food at all
the bad
the service
our waiter was very polite and friendly the few times we saw him
he brought us menus and then left us waiting for minutes before coming_back to take our order
he then disappeared for most our meal
we had to ask another server to track him down to get our bill
needless_to_say our drinks were not refilled
we also waited a very long time for our food
the ugly
the belly_dancing
actually it wasn't the bellydancing
more specifically the dramatic rise in music and the incessant finger chimes of the dancer grew to be irritating
the dancing was fun to watch in the beginning but became tiresome after first few minutes
it was impossible to chat without shouting at my husband
good place
prices were reasonable and the food was good
but the service needs some work
i love indian_cuisine
so much so
that if i see a sign from the roadway advertising indian food
i'll veer across three lanes of traffic
driving as though i'm vin diesel's stunt double in those
fast and furious
movies
all in an unashamed effort to sample their worldly delights
well
tandoori_times is just one of those places
when i'm in the mood for indian
i will typically run other drivers off the road
push mothers with strollers out of the way
and knock the legs out from under old folks
on my way to td
and all for one menu item
the bengun bhartha
this eggplant_dish is so glorious
it's as though it was passed down from the garden of eden's secret recipe book
which eve presumably stole right along with that apple
all the other menu_items are good if not great
but as i say
the eggplant is one of those dishes that makes me fantasize about it while i'm eating my wife's homemade cooking
i hate to admit it
but td has made me a food philanderer
as far as service
ambiance
and everything else
who cares
when you love something as much as i love their eggplant_dish
the waiter could have servers alzheimer's
my table could be in the middle of the parking_lot
and that idiotic indian music could be blaring faux barry manilow
i simply don't care
just give me the eggplant
some chai_tea
and a guest who hates indian so i can snag all the leftovers
i eat my fair share of indian food and i gotta say
this is probably one of the best
their masala has a smokey flavor to it that is amazing
good selection of indian beers and a nice happy_hour menu
customer_service was excellent
we will_definitely_go_back
i'm from the bay_area land of all things good eats
so i'm always leary about trying new places in phoenix
i tried this spot on my birthday because i really wanted indian food
but specifically because the website said they had belly_dancing entertainment
drove all the way there to find out belly_dancing only happens friday and saturday
bummer
ok so food
it was hella spicy and i like spicy food
but my children couldn't eat it
everyting was one note of spicy so it was hard to enjoy the good flavors
worse off is you didn't have much to wash it down with since there are no refills on drinks
but thank heavens for the hot chai table at least
to top it off i think the prices are wayyy to high as you have to order everything
rice and naan are not included wih the meals
every other indian spot i've been to that is standard
overall the ambience was quaint but i'm sad to say i've had better and didn't have to spend over for tandoori_chicken
spinach paneer
samosas
and pesto naan
the food is awesome
atmosphere is nothing special
but decent
this was my first time visiting tandoori_times
after seeing it advertised on groupon
i thought i'd give it a try
my friend and i decided to go for lunch to celebrate her birthday
it was very busy
which was promising
the waitress was on her second day working there and was unfamiliar with the menu
but she was friendly
the house salad was mediocre
the entree
algoo gobi
was delicious
but the desserts were awful
the
mango
ice_cream was a neon orange and tasted nothing like mango
or any flavor of ice_cream id ever tasted actually
kinda vanilla
kinda puke
yuck
the rice_pudding was not worth eating either
the worst part of the experience was being followed out into the parking_lot
after leaving the groupon and cash tip
to be told that we needed to come speak with management about not ordering at least worth of food
really
i told the waiter that we had spent just over
and we obviously didn't expect any cash back from the groupon
he said his manager was
fussy
and wouldn't like it
i basically told_him that was too damn bad
and that i wasn't ordering more in food
i was actually kinda saving them
he finally figured out what i was saying and left us alone
i did end up calling the manager though
who was not pleased to hear about our experience with the dumb waiter
i don't foresee returning there
i took fellow yelpers' recs and ordered naan and bengun bhartha while my bf ordered chicken_korma
it was all incredible
i've been apprehensive about indian food after a couple bad experiences years_ago
but tandoori_times has changed my perspective degrees
i cannot wait_to_go_back
plus
a majority of the customers tonight were south_asian indians so you know it's truly good indian_cuisine
best indian food there is
i get the chili prawns every time with the potato naan_bread
if you like spicy
get chili prawns or chili_chicken
it's perfection
i crave their naan_bread daily
only complaint is that the service is pretty slow
our waiter was very nice and friendly which made up for the slow service
the bellydancer
kinda awkward
some people we were with were into it
but it was uncomfortable and i basically wanted her to leave our table alone
haha
honestly
it's more like a stripper dancing in front of you as your trying to have a nice romantic dinner with your boyfriend
what a treat
p go during the week to avoid the awkward dancer with abnormally loud music
but the food is worth everything else and i'm giving this stars for the food only
we drive from gilbert to phoenix all the time for this place
the drive is worth it
have been there times now
we had two of the smaller happy_hour apps to start
samosa and the shrimp
both were great
happy drink deals were good
had the vodka lassi
good and inexpensive
for dinner we had the tikka masala lamb and coconut chicken
tried a variety of their naan
all were fresh and delicious
favorite is still the plain_naan but you can't_go_wrong with any of them
service was excellent
really made_us_feel like they were grateful that we were there
recommendation
go durning happy_hour and start off with a couple apps and drinks
being indian_cuisine
most of the dishes have a fantastic spicy flavor
unfortunately my wife doesn't share this same sense of taste
you can request that they keep the spice to a minimum if you can't_handle it
they served us stale rice
average main_dishes
not as flavorful
not enough meat in the lamb dishes
overpriced
i left my iphone here and one of the guys there stole it literally
i went there to collect and they denied it
i sat there from noon till pm till that person who served my table arrived and after too much struggle he accepted and gave me my phone
he was lucky i did not hand him to the cops
never ever go there again
totally untrusted staff
my first experience with tandoori_times amounted to a combination of poor service
but excellent food
went to check this out with a groupon
food was fantastic
service excellent
i would go back for sure
a pleasant surprise
i like this place
i wouldn't say it's the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
but it's close by and very convenient for me to get to and has some good options
i really enjoy their wraps
an easy and quick eat that's also delicious
i really like their naan choices too
lots of different flavors
very tasty
i like to get their tandoori_chicken
pretty good not the best i've ever had
but still
if i want tandoori_chicken
i don't have too far to go
definitely a good location
prices are okay in my experience indian_restaurants always seem kinda pricey
and the charging extra for rice is normal
though i don't care for it
i mean really
who isn't gonna need rice with their paneer
i think the one complaint i have is the service
it doesn't matter when i go there or how crowded it is or isn't the service is always slower then i'd like
and it's a different waiter everytime so i don't get that
still
worth going to on the ocassion i am craving_indian_food
amy
our server was very attentive and pleasant
she was wearing this pretty blouse and i asked about it
and she told me the owner's mother sells them on fridays
def going to check that out next time
i really hope they have itty bitty sizes for me
food
nan was overcooked
the bottom side was burnt
chicken_tikka_masala
seasoning
texture
and consistency of the dish was excellent
chicken was just a tad try but overall
great flavor
would be more awesome if they sliced up the chicken into smaller cubes to give flavor consistency
recommended esp for ppl who don't like spicy
its very
umami
i enjoy the creamy touch this place gives to it
shich distinguishes this place from other places
seasoned rice
came out warm
cooked just right
samosas choley
non spicy dish
i eat it with the red sauce
spicy
to add a lili kick
the exterior was fried crispy just right
and the mashed potato inside were soft and warm
beans were very well seasoned and cooked
could tell they put time into it
methi chicken
i tried this dish for the first time and i must admit i like it quite a bit
ordered spicy
have water prepared
amy was diligent w h
i wish i could go to this place every day if i could afford to
dropping down to three stars
on a recent visit
i saw two roaches on the main floor of the restaurant
no one seemed to care
so i got up and stepped on one
i pointed_out the other
and one of the staff killed it
but they didn't seem surprised
i know that roaches are hard to control
but having two of them wandering about in a busy restaurant just isn't a good thing
also
our waiter was an overly chatty guy who seems to think we are interested in his voice
they had some good staff in the past
but i suspect the owner
who likes to get drunk and hang out on the patio
gives me the impression of a guy who would be difficult to work for
the food is still decent and better than anything else i've found
but i'm looking for alternatives
the food was ok for a top dollar pricing
service was fine for adults with babies
two month old toddlers did not eat or drink and no plates was served
each of us had one drink w people having refills
fairly simple service
we were slapped with an automatic gratuity charge as we had people in our party
babies no mess
beware
we are confused
the waiter said its the number of heads and not who eats matters
advice to stay_away_from this expensive place that rips off customers
we went here for dinner a couple of days back for a celebration
we first chose to sit at a booth
those seats were incredibly uncomfortable
the back rests are too thick which makes the seat really small
so we moved to a table
we started with an appetizer aloo_tikki
which was good
but the chutneys could have been more flavorful
we had baingan bharta
eggplant
which was pretty much burnt and panneer tikka masala which was normal
the breads were good
but the aloo naan was too thick in my opinion
and the veg briyani was pretty ok ish
the lassis were not bad
while we were waiting for our food
there was a big party with a kid who was just let loose and was running from one table to another
before we could realize what was happening
he just threw up next to us
his parents were least bothered and just wiped him up
continued eating and the kid got back to running
we were disgusted to say the least and the waiter moved us to another table
but even after they cleaned up the mess
we could smell vomit throughout the time we were there
they should have used a strong disinfectant
i strongly suspect they used only water to clean it
so anyway
we lost our appetite
ate very little
skipped dessert and took the rest of the food home
with mediocore food and bad ambience
our experience wasn't all that good
one star for the service
one star for the panneer dish
i have to say that this is the best and cleanest indian food i have ever had
from the moment we walked in we loved the smells that greeted us and along with the very friendly service i was sold
my husband ordered the coconut chicken curry and i the paneer makani and three garlic tandoori breads
i could have just eaten the bread
super yum
everything was as we ordered it and food was stove hot
i love_this_place and will go there again and again
to all the haters out there
this is good food
come on
the atmosphere here was great
very laid back and relaxing
the live belly_dancer was a nice_touch
the food and service in the other hand was not so great
i got the chicken_biryani
number
and wren brought the food out was impressed with the portion until i found only small pieces of chicken in the mix the rest was veggies and rice
the service was either to overboard or none existent
asked for a drink and minutes_later got my drink but when ordering the waiter asked me times what i wanted when i told_him i needed some time
overall atmosphere is a star food and service star
when they drink dey rum
dey only want roti
aloo with channa
mix up with some curry
wish they would play more chutney on the radio
anyway
back to the review
this is the closest thing arizona has to a good guyanese
or trini
curry
since there isn't guyanese roti shop
that i'm aware of
in az i make do with tandoori
the atmosphere is cozy and inviting
the staff always friendly and accommodating
the only thing i'm not a fan of is the belly_dancing when i'm eating
makes me feel like i'm in a strip club when they're people sticking money in the dancer's sari
i love the fact that there are always indians eating here
that's a good sign
you wait a little longer for your food but that means it's fresh
it's not fast_food so if you can't_handle the wait
go to mc donalds
this is not a food factory
i always get the tikki_masala with the aloo naan
it's good and it faintly satisfies my cravings for curry with roti or dahl pouri
tandoori's version of roti is some chip thing not a west indian roti
so if_you're_looking for that get the naan
the only thing missing was some rum haha
the portions are very generous so if you're on a diet
be prepared to slip up
prices are great
i believe a dinner for with no alcohol
is around
very affordable for fresh cooked food
yes please
nice interior
casual yet elegant
well priced menu with many options
food is delicious
really wonderful naan
fyi bread
tandori_chicken is great available in all white_meat
vindaloo chicken almost the best cesars had
make sure use the green chutney
if indian_cuisine is new to you the staff was also r eally good with menu suggestions and serving size
live bug in sauce
i saw a bug crawling in green sauce which i already put it in my food
when i reported it to waiter there she just disappeared with the sauce
no one came to my table for minutes and i had to call waiter to replace my food with bug infected food after minutes
worst experience ever
i have to start with the garlic_nan
my favorite part of indian_cuisine is the nan
we oredered orders of garlic_nan and it was burnt
not just a little over cooked
the whole bottom of each piece was black charred burnt
completly ruined the meal
the tiki_masala and vindaloo were both good but for the price
i can get just as good and bigger portions just about everywhere else
the prices were really over the top
you pay for rice and nan as well regardless of what you order
i did not feel like i had a meal by_any_means and that is what dishes
one
small plate
nan
rice
and one drink cost us
we were both just full but had i been with a guy or my step father
we would have needed more food for
the atmosphere is great
the place looks really clean
the nan was so bad though that it ruined the meal and even if it was perfect
i still would have only given it three stars because the prices are just way more than everywhere else
i had more reasonable meals at the best indian_cuisine restaurants in san_francisco
our server was good
however
after our
small plate
she seemed a little put off that we wanted clean plates for our meals
she did bring them and was nice about it but we shouldn't have had to ask
with all the sauces on the meals
mixing them would not have been good and our plates were clearly very dirty after the appetizer
won't be back
just not worth the price
i'm in here for lunch every month or so
and i'm always impressed
fantastic food at very decent prices
it's a great spot to hit if you're craving some indian food
but don't necessarily want to go the buffet route
they've usually got a good crowd
but the service has always been top_notch
no matter how busy
poor
poor management
i had a groupon voucher for this restaurant
and i tried to use it today with a friend as my guest
we arrived and i asked right away what the process was for redeeming the groupon
did they want the voucher now or when the check arrives
the nice server said
now is ok
and i opened the app on my iphone and she wrote down the number
she handed my phone back to me
and i showed her that i was going to press the redeemed button
no problem
my friend and i ordered drinks
a mango_lassi and a diet coke
the server brought the drinks
and my friend and i continued to make small talk and look over the menu
suddenly
the server and a manager were back at the table
there's a problem with the groupon
when we try to enter the number
it says it's been redeemed
no kidding
i just redeemed it in front of the server
the server then apologized because it was her first day
and the manager kept saying
i'm sorry
i can't apply the groupon without the groupon being active
then he went on to say that i should call groupon and have them reactivate this and not to worry because this has happened before
um
is groupon going to take care of this right now
i don't think so
i just wanted to ask at this point
and this is your customer's fault because
so there i had pressed the redeemed button in good faith in front of the server so that she wouldn't get in trouble
i've had people thank me at other places because they forgot to ask me to do this
so i just do it now in front of them
ease of anxiety cuz who needs that
right
and i'm now being told by the manager that we'll have to pay cash because he has no recourse with regard to processing the promotion
good management would have apologized for their establishment's mistake and then filed a claim with groupon themselves
but not here
and the very least he could have done was comp'd our drinks
i think that tab was about
any attempt at concession might have led me to just stay
order a meal and work it out later
but i was furious at this point
work it out
bud
it's what you get paid for
did i mention that our booth was one of two occupied when we were seated before this fiasco
management here needs to
buy a vowel
before i would even consider coming_back to this place
good customer_service can make all the difference when dealing with the general public
this establishment has
obviously
yet to learn that
worst service in town
bought certificate at restaurant
com and was told that we couldn't use it since they don't honor the certificate anymore
i have to get my back from them
haven't tried their food and i will not come here again
went here the other night for dinner
i was worried
because i am a picky eater and have never had indian food before
i had the tandoori_chicken and a naan
which is kind of like a pita
and both were really good
on top of that
while we were eating all of the sudden
the music got kind of loud and we were a bit confused
as it turns_out
they have a belly_dancer that dances there while you're eating
our server was also very nice
the belly_dancing makes it a fun atmosphere
and the food was awesome
have been frequenting tt as long as they've been in the valley
was always happy with service and food
but now i see service going down the tube
had to wait min for drinks order
looks like they prejudice their own
bring out water with no ice without asking
p some of us drink with ice
our server just wanted to rush through
very bad i do know they have good servers
but inconsistency doesn't help
one bad experience is all it takes for not coming_back
if kids have to eat whatever is on the menu is not good enough in my book
was highly_recommended this restaurant by client
the service was a total miss
the food was okay to mediocre
way too expensive for what it is
been to india several times for business and never seen belly_dancing in india
i asked several client friends that are indian if belly_dancing is a tradition
not one said yes
the belly_dancing was a bit annoying and felt slightly uncomfortable with my guests
the dancer was annoyed that no one at my table appreciated it did not tip
she just started to fling her hips closer
i would have flung my naan at her to get the hell away from us
i'm surprised by the low ratings that tandoori_times has received
we really enjoy coming here
and will often come for family dinners when people come into town
we really enjoy the belly_dancing
the women are talented
balancing candles
swords
etc
it's something different and it's always fun when someone at our table gets up and dances too
we also enjoy the hookah lounge on the patio
the patio is a really nice private spot
they have tons of different flavors and the staff is always helpful and attentive
the free_chai is also quite delicious
i love the house salad
the dressing is really delicious
it is a yogurt based dressing with very delicious spices
i really could eat it with a spoon
but i keep it classy and refrain
i also order the vegetable_biryani it's perfectly seasoned and absolutely_amazing
it is delicate
a little spicy and really shows perfect restraint
we love getting the naan
my favorites are
garlic
mmmm so well seasoned
onion
aloo
stuffed with potato
chii naan with cilantro and and green chili
just the right amont of kick
and
my husband loves the keema naan
minced lamb
dishes that are notable
so says my family
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken saag
tandoori fish
my discerning father in law called it one of the best dishes he's ever had
many at the table agreed
also
i forget which but a few of the lamb dishes are a hit
sorry not that helpful
tandoori_times isn't a cheap indian_joint
but we don't mind paying for the quality of food and the experience
we actually had a very different experience than we have had in the past last_night
we ordered different_types_of naan
and they forgot the garlic and gave_us aloo instead
they made it right
by bringing the garlic
but it took a while
i ordered the house salad and it wasn't as fresh as it typically is
i also ordered the vegetable_biryani rice with no peas
when it came
there were peas
i told the waiter and he apologized
and said we should keep that one and they would make another one
then he came back a few seconds later and said
actually i need to take that one
i was obviously very concerned at this point that they were going to pick out the peas from my dish
the dish came back a few minutes_later
luke warm
with a rogue pea or two
this was very uncharacteristic of our times at tandoori_times
and i'm hoping it was just an off night
we will be back again
and i have my fingers crossed that it will be a better experience
back up to stars because the food here is consistently good and their daily specials are really excellent
the tuesday lamb dish is exceptional
and the goat_curry on friday is amazing
i'm not a big_fan personally of the belly_dancing
and their pappadum's have gotten worse just plain now
and seemingly pre cooked days in advance
but the food is great
and still better than anything else i can find in phoenix metro
most authentic_indian_food outside of india
i know
because i've been
don't let the idea of exotic food scare you away
there's something for everyone here
even vegetarians and children
try the paneer
pressed cheese
dishes or samosas choley if you don't like meat
try the chicken or paneer makhani if you don't like the heat
for medium spicy dishes
the chicken_tikka_masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan_bread
if you want a bite of something that'll bite you back with a really great flavor
try the tandoor fish wrap
the key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of or more
get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table
you don't have to drink alcohol
but there's a full service bar at all of the tandoori_times locations and the beer_selection is above_average
this is the original location and offers a great
semi upscale atmosphere and a nice patio complete with hookah
bellydancers join the fun on friday and saturday nights
decent value if you crave very good quality food
an exotic atmosphere and an authentic indian experience
ok
the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic
but it's definitely exciting
one of my favorite weekend hangouts
solid out of
the lunch_specials here are great
especially the vegetarian menu on fridays
the lunch wrap is always a favorite
the salad that comes with the vegetarian lunch menu isn't that great
but the rice is ok
the meals are quick and spicy and the service is very good
not an_expert_on_indian food
my daughter took me
and much to my surprise
i loved it
a
wonderful indian food
the best food and service
give it a try and you_will_not_be_disappointed

best indian food in phoenix scottsdale
great food
great atmosphere
clean
excellent service
great food
but i've had better elsewhere
probably the best i've had around scottsdale
hubby and i decided to
eat outside the box
for our latest date_night
this is definitely a good place to go if you typically don't have a very adventurous palate
the music was a tad loud and our server was on the slow side
but otherwise we had a great experience trying some new dishes
i had the lamb_curry and it was very good
hubby had the saturday special
some kind of beef
can't remember_the_name
and it was very good and just a little spicy
the garlic_naan and basmati_rice were to die for
their_website states they are open on weekends pretty much all day
so my husband called to get us a reservation because for some absurd reason you need a reservation to use their groupon
they didn't answer so he thought they were busy and called back
eventually someone picked_up and made him a reservation
we showed_up on time and the first thing out of the waitstaff's mouth was
so are you the guy who called times
um i don't think it was times but yeah sure
guilty
the thing was that the asshole was relentless
embarrassing us in front of the other customers
we tried to explain that the website and the voice mail gave_us incorrect information but the guy paolo still ended_up blaming us by saying
you should have left a voice mail
and
everyone was sleeping and finally someone woke up to answer roe you
he didn't even apologize and definitely made_us_feel like we were at fault
if he would have taken ownership of the issue it would have been a lot different
i could take the first snide comment and let it roll
but he wouldn't come off it nor apologize
then we thought hey if they are mad that we woke the cooks up then maybe they'll mess with our food or something
we felt so embarrassed and ridiculed and everyone was staring at us so we just left
i work hard for my money
i'm not going to spend it on assholes when there are so many other delicious restaurants to choose from
this place is hard_to_find and i used to forget it even existed
we finally made it there mid week
the menu is huge
so many traditional_indian dishes our favorites like chicken_makhani and garlic_naan plus many others
our waiter was very friendly and had some good drink recommendations off the cocktail list
it was happy_hour pricing at the time
the alcoholic mango_lassi was delectable
there aren't many indian eateries in scottsdale
but this is probably the best
out of the other that i know of
not a fancy place
dress casual
or buy an indian style blouse in the front of the restaurant
i tried to use google translate to find out how to say
holy crap that was expensive
in some indian language but didn't have the option
i came here with a client yesterday for lunch
it was my second time a tandoori_times
although this location was a new one
its actually kind of tough to find
tucked_away in a pretty large complex of businesses and restaurants
we sat_down and were greeted_by a very nice waiter
we both ordered an indian beer and asked for suggestions
he pointed a few out and we got to ordering
appetizer was a lamb kabob
but they take out the stick before it is served
just ground lamb with some saut ed onions and peppers
it was accompanied_by a few sauces
it was ok but certainly nothing earth shattering
then we ordered two entrees he recommended
one was a shrimp dish with a reddish curry
the other was chicken_vindaloo
pretty much chicken with potatoes in a yellowish curry
he also suggested we get some nan
a flat_bread
and some rice
advising the dishes were family_style
hope i don't sound to crabby
but the portions were crap
i was expecting it to be like a chinese restaurant where you get a good portion to share
nope
the shrimp dish had a whopping shrimp
for bucks i expected much more than that
especially after teh family_style sharing comment
if i go to a chinese place and get spicy shrimp they bring out a proper portion
same with the chicken
maybe or chunks of chicken with a little potatoes
same story as above
anywhere_else and i'd get a mountain of chicken
enough to share
right
the little bit of lamb was
plus they also charged for the nan and rice
bucks each
anyway
the food was definitely good
but when accompanied_by a bill
plus tip
this was probably the smallest meal i've had
both my client and i could have eaten much more if allowed
so i guess to sum it up
good food but not at its price point
those things have to line up to get a glowing review from this yelper
highly_recommend it though if price isn't a big concern
can't wait to have to explain to my boss why i'm expensing an lunch for just me and one client at an indian_joint
i figured i would write an update on this review since the waiter reached out and attempted to rebut the points in my review
unfortunately all it did was change their review from stars to one
the waiter's comments are below
waiter response to my original review
hi
i waited to respond so i could look at your check for this day
first i apologize for your experience lamb seekh kabob is served without skewers because they are metal ones and ' long
we have daily lunch_specials which run from
to
its complete lunch and comes with everything
lunch_specials combo of two dishes is only
additional
we cannot compare indian restaurant with chinese restaurant
tips were voluntary
we will surely look into our prices compared_to_other indian_restaurants
thanks
my response to this is
i followed your lead when ordering our meal from beginning to end
i trusted you
if you had options that could have significantly reduced our bill
why was there absolutely no mention of this during my minute lunch
i originally thought the service and food was good
but meal was overpriced compared to what we received
instead
apparently the service was not good
you seem to have let me pay for each meal plus an additional for rice and for nan when we could have gotten much more for a lesser price
and likely left very satisfied
we trusted you to guide us to good food
not just good food that would pad the bill at a la_carte prices
in the future
you may want to guide your customers to your specials
eaten here twice this week delicious indian food
my fianc and i are visiting from iowa and honestly cannot get enough of this place
their staff
bobbi and joel
were really kind and helpful
they know the menu in and out and joel had great suggestions
i had the chicken_korma and it was perfect
recommend getting an order of naan plain and pesto were really good
also a must have is their delicious basmati_rice
oh
and don't forget to get a mango_lassi they're really tasty
another great thing is that their happy_hour is from and they have a great selection of well priced drinks
it's pretty challenging to find this location it's on the north west corner of via ventura and hayden road
google maps has it wrong
persevere it's worth it
this is my favorite indian food in az
super high_quality
fresh_ingredients and the best flavor in town
favorite dishes include shrimp or veggie_korma
tandoori anything
and a variety of delicious paneers
and the naan is incredible garlic is my favorite
but i've tried plain
potato and onion
and they're all wow
the atmosphere is nice sit_down restaurant
although the seating could be a little comfier
the service is always friendly and the patio is lovely
the indoor seating isn't super comfortable
but definitely good enough
seriously delicious food
the food is simply superb always tasty
i often have sag paneer and it is really good
the naan is great
too
this is a very good place to go with a vegetarian because there are many
many options
when the weather is good
it's lovely to sit on the patio
we sat there a_few_weeks_ago and while the service was pretty slow
the entire experience was good
it was saturday_night and they were busy
the vindaroo and naan were exceptional
good portions
it appears they need more servers as it seemed chaotic
or maybe a bartender
i'm
typing
this
to
demonstrate
the
service
speed
very
slow
seriously
minutes for dinner to arrive and after dinner coffee
it was chai_tea
took twenty minutes
there were only six of us
went there to meet friends for dinner
food was okay
i won't be back
although the food is great
the service is just too slow
we stepped inside the door and about five employees saw us and not one acknowledged us
i am not coming_back here
had dinner there tonight
the food was fine
not particularly distinguished but not bad either
unfortunately
the service was brutally slow
it really should not take an_hour for food
meal was over two hours
no desert
sorry but wouldn't go back to find out if this was an aberration
the other reviews suggest its not
great service
i'm a fan of the belly_dancing on weekends which can be fun when on the patio with enjoyable weather
i also recommend the prawn vindaloo if you want spice
the service here was deplorable
i heard several complaints of the lack of service
and i experienced it firsthand
it took minutes to get a menu
and another to get the coke i ordered
how do you forget rice with an entree at an indian restaurant
i hope the food is excellent
but i doubt it
the worst chicken_vindaloo i have ever experienced on three continents
i would not go back to this restaurant
i complained to what appeared_to_be the owner
who stated the chef would come and see me
i am still waiting
i feel like i'm missing something when i don't come here at_least_once_a_week
love_this_place
i can't get enough especially since my friends and i discovered they have a special happy_hour menu
at this point
we don't even need to look at the menu
i love the chilli naan
chilli paneer
tandoori fish
and samosa
you might be thinking whoa
hold on tiger
that's a whole lotta food
yes
it is
i always have leftovers from this place for the next day
yum
first time here
will be back for sure
had the lamb_vindaloo
chicken_tiki
naan sampler and some kingfishers
all amazing
paulo our waiter was awesome
very attentive and took time to explain everything thoroughly to us ignant white folks
give paulo a raise
service was bad
come if you're not in any rush
i'm talking over an_hour before you get a drink
they also forgot to bring out if appetizers which we were glad of in the end because it may have added another hour onto the wait
the belly_dancer gimmick is annoying but i am a joyless swine so it might be your thing
i don't like being worked for tips for something i didn't ask for though and i'm pretty sure belly_dancing is not an indian tradition anyway
food
i ordered a chicken_vindaloo
which is supposed_to_be spicy but was pretty mild it was really tasty though so no complaints
the missus got a chicken_tikka_masala which she enjoyed too
naan was decent
they also serve kingfisher which is a fine beer
best tasting indian i've had in phoenix so far
i have to write that i was disappointed
the problem may have been the waiter but our appetizers didn't come until minutes_later when we had to remind him that it hadn't arrived
he forgot
he forgot the channa_masala and we were too far into our meal to ask for it again
he didn't ask us how hot we wanted our food so it all came out bland without much spice
if you look at my ratings for indian_cuisine
i pretty much love all of it
by far the best i have found in the phoenix area is the dhaba in tempe
here the food was fine but given the alternatives
i wouldn't go back
the veggies were too mashed together and the chicken_tikka_masala sauce was too thick and goopy
the lamb_biryani was good but since they made it so mild
i didn't enjoy it as much as i could have
the atmosphere is cute and more upscale than most indian_restaurants and the mall area is attractive and upscale as well
came here to meet a friend for lunch and i was very disappointed
we ordered biryani rice
not bad but not great either
coconut chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
and garlic_naan
after waiting min we got our food
the chicken dishes were lukewarm at best and there was no flavor difference between the dishes
i had asked for my masala to be spicy but there was no spice whatsoever
the garlic_naan had so much garlic on it that it was like biting straight into raw garlic
we waited another min to get our check since our server was nowhere to be found
i finally had to go to the bar to get the check
do not come here if you want authentic indian_cuisine
value_for_money and its not expensive
with top rate quality food their lunch time menu sets the standard for the rest to follow go on try it
satisfied
tonight's dinner was one of the best meals i have ever had
the chicken_tikki_masala was superb and the naan_bread was the perfect accompaniment
we had a wonderful belly_dancer with a fantastic body and personality to match
the food is good
but the service ruins it
hence the star
i made dinner reservations for people for pm on friday
april th
we had a movie show to catch at
pm
but i figured
hour for dinner should be enough time
boy
was i wrong
we arrived at pm and of us were seated in a booth for four people
go figure
after minutes
we pulled a chair for the fifth person
not a big_deal
but you expect better when you make dinner reservations before hand
anyhow
it took a good minutes for our server to greet us
by this time
we had our entire order ready to be placed
at
we place the order
our drinks were served at
pm
it was just kingfisher
so i guess we got lucky there
it's pm now
minutes since we placed our order
and our food is nowhere to be seen
we try to get a hold of our very busy
slightly rude or maybe he just had a very dry sense of humor that none of the five people in my party really understood
we told the server that we had a movie to catch at
and were hoping to get the food asap now
the server tells us that our food is almost here
with no sign of regret
minutes_later
it's now
pm
our food is still not here
my friend and i go over to the counter and ask our server
who is now the bartender
and he tells us that we are second in line
second in line minutes from placing the order
you got to be kidding me
anyhow
very politely we requested him to cancel our order
since we really didn't wanna miss our movie
then our server disappears
we get hold of another employee outside the kitchen
requesting to cancel our order
at this point
we just wanted to pay for our drinks and get out of there
the second employee then goes in and minutes_later
our server comes out of the kitchen with our food
it's now
pm
exactly minutes from placing the order
and minutes from being seated
we literally swallow our food and got out of there at
pm
of course
we were late for the movie
and got the rd row from the front
to sum up
a
i made dinner reservations
b
got seated in an undersized booth for people
c
waited for minutes for our food
d
ate our food
which should have been a pleasant experience
in less than minutes
e
got late for the movie
definitely one of the worst restaurant experiences
never again
came here while we were in town visiting family this past saturday_night
and i would say without even reading other reviews_on_yelp
i immediately thought wow
do they even know we are out here
we had requested outdoor seating
and they put a table together really quick for us
however
no one came to give us menus until we had to run back inside to remind them we were here
the waitress was very nice and helpful
she asked how we liked our food prepared and suggested appropriate spice_levels
however
getting our wine
appetizers
food and even the check was a very long process
i don't know if it has to do with kitchen organization or just a lack of needed staff
but do not come here if you are on a schedule
the food is great no complaints there
it wasn't the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
but it really got the job done
we asked for chef hot and it actually came out spicy
we did enjoy it
i recommend the tandoori_chicken
lamb_tikka_masala
lamb_biryani and naan
in sum
good food
slow service
a good place to go if you're not in a rush to get anywhere after
also
do not come here when you're on the brink of starvation
because by the time you get your food you might be on the floor
definitely go on a friday or saturday when the belly_dancer is here
she is great and really invokes the crowd and kids
i liked the coconut chicken the best
the spicy wasn't that spicy so next time i will try indian hot
our server
joe was amazing and knew the menu very well
the best part was the happy_hour
you can get a glass_of_wine for only
one of the best indian places i've been to i'm a while
authentic
tasty food
it is a bit expensive
but you get a good amount of good for your money
which makes the cost more bearable
i frequently order take out and they are quick and rarely make mistakes
i do wish though that they would remind you to order rice separately i always forget
what a pathetic food
we went here to celebrate birthday
ordered biriyani
which is so tasteless not even worth of touching it
there chilli chicken is one of the worst i ever had in my life
we were there before
but looks like it's a rapidly going down
i should say this is the worst food ever tasted in a while
watch out if you want to venture out into this place
we went for lunch yesterday and wanted to use a groupon
but we had the dinner one instead
we both ordered from their lunch menu and got wraps
i got the aloo_tikki
potatoes
which also had lettuce
onions
mint_chutney and tamarind_sauce
the menu didn't say this
but it also has mayonnaise in it
it wasn't horrible
but i would've preferred not having it
overall it was great and their naan is really good
i look_forward to trying more items for dinner
like their biryani and samosas
tandoori_times doesn't have a buffet
and i actually thought they had a buffet based_on the groupon description
but they have killer lunch_specials
they have different appetizers
entrees
and desserts everyday on a lowly discounted price of per dish
we were able to order all our main_courses off of this menu and went on our way with a great lunch
the restaurant has great decorations and colorful ambiance as well
i'm shocked i haven't reviewed these_guys before
this is my go to place for indian food
really delicious
pros very good food
i was a newbie to indian food when i first came here
years and years_ago
and now i feel super confident in my ability to order it
you can request what level of spiciness you'd like
scale of to
which is nice if you're a wuss like i am
they have bellydancers on the weekends
don't make eyecontact or they will ask you to dance with them lol
the servers are usually very attentive
fill up soda's quickly
can answer questions
you know
the usual
cons i guess my biggest gripe would be that they are forever offering a groupon
the worst part
when i came here last i was with my aunt and she used a groupon
nooooo
i hate hate hate groupon and groupon users
sorry aunt kris
you are of course exempt because you at least tip on the full amount
i say this with love tandoori_times as i have been loyal to you since high school
no more groupon
honestly it ruins the experience for us loyal full paying customers because suddenly the restaurant is packed with these deal chasing vultures
we went to tandoori_times last_night as it was the only place we fancied that was open
only other tables were taken and our service was great
really friendly server
food was pretty good
i had the mattar_paneer and hubby had the chicken_vindaloo 'chef hot'
also tried the chili naan
all very good
not the best we've ever had
but very good
place could do with a good clean
the area under our table hadn't seen a broom or mop in a while
but all in all
we liked it and would go back
i have had quite a bit of indian food in my life and this has been by far the best
four of us stuffed ourselves into a food coma
the ingredients were all fresh
the lunch_specials such a great deal
the flavors were out_of_this_world
i want to go back soon
i am getting hungry thinking about it
great service also by the way
they were attentive
friendly
and quick
this place just opened last saturday and is one of the first restaurants in centennial center north of ann
west of the
my husband and i went there tonight and really enjoyed it
i think we enjoyed not having to drive all the way to paradise to find indian food
the dishes were a touch expensive for the area
but the quality and location made up for paying a bit extra
they are working on getting their liquor license
so our bill was cheaper_than normal anyhow
i had aloo_gobi and my husband had chicken_korma
their vegetable_samosas were very good
served with two dipping_sauces
you can pick the spiciness of your dish from one to ten
i got a and felt it was very mild and my husband got a and said it felt more like a so go much spicier than you normally would
the service was very polite and prompt we will definitely go there again from the look of the menu
we will have many other things to try
also
i will be trying their lunch_special soon much cheaper and many options there
this girl
points to self with both thumbs
is soooo lucky to have good eats around her
woot
indian_curry_bowl is another semi fast_food semi sit_down joint in the northwest las_vegas area and also down the street from market grille cafe
it's located just down from fresh easy and in the same shopping_center as hr fitness and cafe rio
all the dishes are mom cooked and the mama's and staff are all super_nice
too
even though i haven't tried everything
i can confidently jump to the conclusion that everything is probably pretty good
the curry isn't as thick as other curries i've had
but i definitely like the flavor resulting from all the spices
you can asked for the chili on the side if you're eating with people with different acceptance levels of heat
personally
i luv that stuff
gimme gimme gimme
here's what i tried so far
per the owner
all chicken used in dishes is chicken_breast
garlic_naan slightly charred
but it was nice and chewy
lil' bit of burnt taste gives it flavor
haha
vegetable_samosa deep_fried
but not too greasy at all
when do i ever say
no
to deep_fried
butter_chicken similar to chicken_tikka
chicken_tikka_masala
tomato based curry
chicken saag
spinach based stew
chicken_korma
coconut based curry
p
s
they have a lunch_special for a curry_bowl that's
depending_on the extras you get
yummy curry on fluffy rice happy lunch time nap
woohoo
first off
thanks to julia and michelle for putting reviews in
i was treated to a lunch that i've been waiting two years for
much like market grille
it is run by the mom
this is what the nw was missing
i really can't add much that hasn't already been said except please be sure to treat yourself soon
i had the chicken_korma
veggie_samosas and garlic_naan for about
and it filled me up for both lunch and then as a leftover for dinner
i love eating here
it is my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in las_vegas
i usually get the chicken_tikka for guilt free dining
but everything on the menu is great
i highly_recommend the korma dishes
i love indian_curry_bowl
every time i head to las_vegas i have to make a trip there
the food is simply amazing
the butter_chicken is awesome and the daal makhani is awesome
ask for it extra_spicy
id also like to say that their stuffed naan_bread is hands_down the best tasting naan ive ever had
that says alot because i have quite a few indian friends
ive read of other people complaning about the prices and i have to disagree the prices_are_reasonable especially considering that the quality of the food is top_notch
the only thing i'd have to complain_about is that they dont have a beer or wine license
i'd love to have a good beer or nice bottle_of_wine with their food
i actually cant wait til the next time im able to visit las_vegas again
this is one of my favorite restaurants in lv
especially for indian food
the best part is it is in summerlin
the couple that own this restaurant are sweet and adorable
thank goodness they are in retirement and decided to open a restaurant in lv in their spare time
my favorites are
saag_paneer
butter_chicken
onion naan was delicious too
i also like their tomatoe based curry dishes
mango pudding was delicious for dessert
i'm impressed
although my husband and i have been eating here for months after a recommendation from a friend
tonight was the first time i had a chance to chat with the chef owner rita
i am truly in awe about how much she knows about food allergies
and the lengths at which she goes to ensure that anyone who eats in her restaurant has a good experience
no_matter_what allergy they may have
she also cooks with pure
organic vegetables and spices and will custom make orders to suit your taste
don't wait a minute more to treat yourself to a meal here
i've recently become addicted to indian food
and had heard about this great things about this place for sometime
i finally deceided to give it a try yesterday evening
man am i glad i did
the food gods have smiled upon this restaurant
befor eyou walk in you can smell the curry from the outside
mmmm
i ordered the chicken_vindaloo
extra_spicy and garlic_naan and it was some of thee best i've ever had
the naan was light and airy delicious
i could have eaten two baskets of it
the chicken_vindaloo portion was huge
i was able to split it with my husband and we both walked out full
this place is definitely going to be seeing a lot of more me in the near future
so glad places like this exist in vegas
a funny thing happened here in las_vegas
the couple that owned and ran the samosa_factory had one of the finest indian_restaurants here in town
well
they sold it off to a new agey couple who have proceeded to debase what the original owners created
then they retired
then this place called the indian_curry_bowl opened to a deserving lack of fanfare
things weren't going well until the icb people coaxed rita and her husband out of retirement and once again las_vegas has these wonderful chefs running one of the best indian places in vegas
the food here is top grade
rita is an indian food goddess
taste one of her mango pies for proof
the lamb dishes are always cooked well meaning tender and moist
the lamb_biryani is a good choice to highlight this
the chicken dishes retain the flavors in all the dishes
without being dry or overpowered
try the sweet and sour curry chicken for a hot
flavorful dish done to perfection
the service on_the_other_hand is can be lacking though
rita's husband helps out here when needed and helps smooth over the lack of professionalism of the remaining wait_staff
this is the weakest element to the business
along with the not made for human shaped tables
bad design and harmful to functionality
and a little music would fill in the sound space as well
this place is not going to impress anyone on decor or service
but once they taste the wonders coming out of the kitchen
well
the food speaks for itself
so
yeah
i was really excited about this restaurant after reading the reviews here and have to agree the food is phenomenal
i had a wonderful butter_chicken
i haven't had indian food that good since returning to the states
very nicely seasoned
naan wasn't greasy and the portion was more than enough for lunch_the_next_day
with a second order of naan
i can't in good conscience give this place higher_than stars
however
because the wait_staff was absolutely atrocious
i went there with my husband and our friend and we were happy to see that we had the place mainly to ourselves
we love indian food and had reviewed the menu online before we came
we told our waitress we were ready to order
i went first and ordered the butter_chicken
level spicy
she stared at me for a second as if i wasn't speaking english
after repeating myself a couple_of_times
she actually took the menu and stared at it like she'd never seen it before
very strange
she mumbled something about her husband
huh
finally got it straight and then shuffled over to the kitchen
she brought over our appetizers
but couldn't remember who had what
the same happened with our entrees there are only three of us in the restaurant
you really couldn't get that right
but the most egregious was during the meal
a good waiter waitress knows how to interject to see if you need something
the two girls in the restaurant had this really strange habit of hanging out near the table until all three of us stopped talking to look in their direction because of the creepy staring
then
instead of i don't know
asking if we needed more water
they would comment on our conversation
we tried to be polite about it
but after the third or fourth time
we started making things up for them to get
more water
tea
soda
napkins
just so we could continue our conversation
not that that helped much
it was such a relief when other patrons came in and they were too busy to hover
the food is good enough that i will do take out orders
but i most certainly won't be eating in again
creepy
i had to try this place after hearing so many good things about it and it certainly did_not_disappoint
i'm not really an indian foodie but here goes
the chicken_korma with rice was absolutely_amazing
the creaminess of the coconut milk and spiciness of the sauce made for a perfect combination of flavors
the garlic_naan was light
fresh and equally flavorful
warning
if you get this takeout
your car will smell like garlic for days
the curry chicken bowl lunch_special
extra_spicy
was tasty and full of spices
it was the perfect portion for lunch
i have only ordered take out on the visits i have made
the place seems to be really slow
so i hope it picks up soon
i know i will_be_going_back soon
i've heard that the samosas are the best
very watery korma
the naan had the texture of baked pizza dough
the only good thing was the tartness of the mango_lassie
they were the previous owners of samosa_factory
but their food didn't seem to carry over
samosa_factory has surpassed this place greatly
this place is decent
my friend and i were looking for a late lunch after a hike at mt charleston
i always want to try somewhere i've never been
so i can yelp it of course
i won't pretend that i know what authentic_indian_food tastes like
the bottom_line for me is whether or not i enjoyed it
i honestly couldn't care less about authentic
i ordered a lamb_curry bowl lunch_special
along with some roti and a mango_lassi
everything was good
maybe i'm just too americanized
but the portion was pretty tiny
it costs
for a curry_bowl and then you add for the lamb
or chicken or shrimp
that's
for a tiny bowl of curry
fortunately
the roti and the lassi rounded out my meal and managed to fill me up
like i said
the food is indeed good
it just seems overpriced
you're paying in the mid teens for a regular entr_e
maybe the decor threw me off
the location and appearance suggest a cheaper price point
next time
i'll take my indian friend's advice and check out india_palace
man
now i'm hungry for some more curry
we went here back in january
the service was really slow
the food was ok but very small portions for the price and i don't like big servings
i cook better indian food at home
service was good and fast
food was great
the owner suggested the korma because i have never tried it and it did_not_disappoint
my fiance and i had a craving for good indian food
we usually would go to india_oven but decided to pick a local place closer to our house
indian_curry_bowl is in the northwest part_of_town in a very quiet shopping_center
considering it's location the prices were rather steep
for most lunch entrees
they do however
have a lunch_special
curry bowls starting around dollars and then dollars extra for anything you'd like to add
ie
vegetables
korma sauce
chicken
etc
the husband
who i think is the owner
was somewhat friendly
a little odd and certainly pushy
we placed our order and he told me to try something else instead
we both decided on chicken curry bowls for lunch and he convinced me to try the korma sauce
when asked how spicy we'd like our lunch
i ordered a and my fiance ordered a
then
we ordered naan
plain_naan
yes
plain_naan
we get our bowls
small
but looked appealing
we taste them
bland and the same level of spiciness for both
non existent
there was no spice in either bowl
the lady at a table near us ordered a ten and asked for more spice because it wasn't spicy at all
i think she had to ask for more spice times
later
our naan came
garlic_naan
oops
he must've decided on that for us as well as that korma sauce
although
it wasn't spicy and wasn't the best indian food
we didn't think it was awful
we ate it
we got our dollar bill and gave him dollars to get some change
he smiled and said
thank you
before we had to ask for change
he looked puzzled but brought us change
overall
not awful
it was worth a shot but we aren't going back
service was mediocre and the food wasn't up to par
i'd rather drive several miles to get to a great indian_restaurant_in_vegas
i ordered the lunch_special
butter_chicken
and also ordered the lunch_special chicken_korma and mango_lassi to go
the only other indian place i've been to was mt
everest during the lunch buffet and mint
and then i was hooked to indian food
i am by no means an expert in indian food so bear that in mind
now
the food
comparing the chicken_makhani
butter_chicken
from here to everest and mint
indian curry bowl's is a lot less creamier with more of a spicy raw tomatoey kick
since i'm so accustomed to that super creamy milky tomato sauce at first i was a bit disturbed but as i continue to eat i wondered if there was also a healthy version of indian food
by no means was it bad
in fact it felt extremely healthy and expertly made with spices and such
it's just i wanted that thick super creamy sauce
which i don't even know if that's
authentic
it just appeals to my taste_buds more
service was good
establishment hired a new waitress
checked if everything was okay
drink was filled
etc
nothing stellar but i never really had high hopes either way
it's not some super fancy restaurant in the first place
i'd go back
the total for two lunch_specials
butter_chicken and chicken_korma
with mango_lassi was near
oh and since so many people kept complaining about portions
we must have some beastmode eaters here
i eat a lot and it was enough for me to feel really full
although takeout will be a liiiiiiiittle smaller in portions because of the plastic container they use
and i have a sneaking suspicion that maybe instead of giving me butter_chicken they gave me that chicken_tikka thingy
which i heard isnt as creamy as butter_chicken
hmmm well i'll give it another go
updated
ordered the butter_chicken again
this time
although the texture was still a bit watery
the taste had that creamy milky taste
i was served by arnand this time
perhaps he was in an iffy mood today
wish the new waitress served me this time
she was a lot more friendlier
the food is amazing
i went to get the vegetarian wrap lunch_special
and i didnt expect it to be that great but i will definately be back after today
definately one of my new favorite places to eat
seems like it is family_owned and i loved how nice they all were and the care they put in their food
all i have to say is you should definately eat here
i was super excited_to_try this place
since the reviews were so great
i should have known it was not going to be a good experience since there was not a single soul in the restaurant
i was so disappointed
it still astounds me to this day
me and my boyfriend tried out their lunch_specials
i ordered a chicken curry_bowl and he ordered a shrimp_curry bowl
our server
which seemed to be the owner
asked us how spicy we wanted it
so we told_him medium
then he proceeded to mumble something about baby food
when we got our food it was utterly horrible
it was a watery bowl of rice and chicken
with no flavor whatsoever
my boyfriends lunch was the same
except his shrimp was still grey
the owner and other workers seemed to be looking something up on their computer
but when they finally got around to checking on us
because i believe i was loudly conversing with my boyfriend about my disdain for our lunch
we asked him to cook the shrimp longer
and told_him there was not much flavor
he went on to blame us for the flavoring
saying that we wanted it not spicy
but that he could bring us flavoring on the side
and that we were that ones that wanted baby food
he also informed us that we did not order the right thing
and that if we had asked him he would have told us what was good
let me ask you dear sir
why is it even on your menu if you know it sucks
adding the curry paste improved it slightly
but don't_get_me_wrong it was still gross
when we checked out we had to find him to get our check
he informed us that we didn't like the food
and it was because it was food we were not use to
i am asian and my boyfriend is white
but that does not mean that we have never had good indian food
overall the service was absolutely terrible
the man was condescending as well as ignorant
all of this for the grand price of
the worst i ever spent in my life
i walked in pm on a tuesday night
it was really slow
in fact we were the only ones in the restaurant
we were greeted_by the waitress and told we could sit anywhere
the room was arranged nicely
there was soft jazz playing overall a good ambiance
the service was quick and to the point
we shared the whole chicken tandoori
which ended_up being too much and we only had half
the chicken was fresh but i felt_like it needed something else
we also had the garlic_nan which was hot and fresh
overall the experience was good
i will come back to try out the rest of the menu
hopefully soon
food was great
prices were high for what you got
it's been about months since i last visited indian_curry_bowl
and i'm sad to say it is because the quality of food has seriously gone down
back approximately a year ish ago
they were so bomb
i thought owner andy was funny as the sarcastic grumpy old man
rita
wife
would come out and ask us how the food was
i'm sad to read that he's coming across as grumpy and condescending
and i can definitely see why
in the last few visits
gone now is the consistency
no more fantastically flavorful curries and yes
the portion_sizes are getting smaller
even the naan comes out soggy
conclusion
please
bring back the tasty indian_curry_bowl that i knew so well
service was awful
the mean owner should not
be serving this place
he was rude and just grumpy
i love what the previous person
the owner should not be in the building
the food was excellent though
ill be back
yea
the curry and naan were good
but way overpriced for the dishes
service was also slow
both the butter_chicken and saag_paneer entrees are outstanding
the naan was warm and tasty
portions seem like they should be bigger considering the price
fresh
quality_ingredients
friendly and local
a little pricey
maybe it's fair considering how good it s
but two entrees
two breads
and a pop came to around
i would highly_recommend this to a friend and will continue to eat there
both times that i have been here
it's been dead
excellent chicken_korma and service
had the chicken naan
lamb samosas
chicken_tikka and the chicken_korma
the korma we ordered mild spice
it was a little watery and since we went months_ago
the portion_size had diminished
the chicken_tikka my hubby ordered super hot
it was not
but had some heat to it
the samosas were tasty
but a bit greasy and the naan was a hit with my and year olds
overall
definitely going back
the food comes out piping_hot and freshly_made
which i love
and all of the flavors are there that i look for in indian food
this is a nice little family_owned restaurant with polite and prompt service
but relaxed enough to seat yourself
i love it and i try to go every few months
we ordered lunch from indian_curry_bowl yesterday
and i can't say enough about how horrible it was
not just the food
but the entire experience
the food was very overpriced
for entrees
side
and orders of samosas
the total came to
i was shocked
and looked over the receipt
they were charging me for chutney
i eat indian food from many different establishments on a regular bases
and the chutney is always complimentary
it's like charging for ketchup
while i was waiting for my order
i was watching the elderly woman prepare the food using
a microwave
really
no burners or stoves going
just a couple of microwaves
the food was not good at all
the samosas were soggy and undercooked
the chicken_tikka_masala and saag_paneer were runny and looked like they literally had been mixed with water
so basically
i paid over for food that was microwaved
seriously
i'm still appalled by that one
and terrible
never again
food was mediocre at best
chicken_tikka_masala was not creamy
had very little chicken
and had no real flavor
saag_paneer was relly runny and the cheese was tough
the naan was good
but how can you screw up naan
severely overpriced
the owner acted like he was doing me a favor with the prices and said that he had new menus already printed with higher prices
i will definitely not be returning
the wife and i ended_up here today after discovering that saffron_flavors_of_india has temporarily closed
i'm sad to report that this place is easily the worst a la_carte indian experience i have had in las_vegas
my wife ordered paneer_tikka_masala and i ordered my standard chicken_tikka_masala
we also had our standard mix of garlic and plain_naan which we love to use the mop up all the lovely rich creamy gravy that you usually associate with indian food and these dishes in particular
what arrived was not rich
creamy or even remotely lovely
they seem to take the
healthy take on indian food
to extremes here
my tikka masala looked like it had been prepared by throwing a few pieces of chicken_tikka into a mixture of blended onion
tomato
green peppers
and cilantro which had then been cut with about a cup of water until watery and tasteless
we heard the microwave going during the preparation
so i'd say that's pretty much exactly what was happening
imagine what you'd get if you microwaved a can of
if it existed
progresso low fat
low sodium indian curry chicken soup
there's something extremely wrong with your chicken_tikka_masala when no matter how many times you re dip your chicken in the
sauce
it comes up completely devoid of anything covering it
the chicken itself was bland
waterlogged and soaked free of any flavour whatsoever
we didn't really have much use for our naan since there was no real gravy here
but my garlic_naan was pretty tasteless
the only minor saving grace of the meal was the excellent home made lemonade and the passable samosas we began our meal with
to round things all off
a bill of close to for a terrible meal in a restaurant that felt_like a subway landed on the table and i knew the second star i was going to award this place just for the lemonade and friendly service was gone
if you're a health fanatic who likes vaguely chili flavoured water with your chicken
paneer etc
then this place might be for you
if your looking for wonderful silky sauces and creamy
nutty tastes
run as far from indian_curry_bowl as you can
this is our go to restaurant
if we don't eat here at_least_once_a_week the cravings won't go away
each dish is prepared to order with the highest quality_ingredients
i would highly_recommend if you are vegetarian and even if you aren't try some of the vegetarian_dishes
the owners andy and rita have such a passion and love for preparing food with the most amazing flavors
for anyone who is complaining about the cost
take a step back and remember you get what you pay for
very disappointing for what you pay
the onion and garlic_naan was the best part of the meal
other then that nothing stood_out or made me want to add this to my list of go to restaurants
we got there at and they close at
but the owner was rushing us and pretty much pushed us out the door
there were a few desserts we were eying but he would not allow us to try them
so in the end we will not be back
i am not an indian food expert by_any_means but i do like to try new places
i stopped by and they had a sign for a lunch buffet for
but i wasn
t sure if i wanted a buffet
the i looked at the menu and saw the prices
i guess the lunch buffet sounds good
they had about menu_items i tried
meatballs
chicken curry
butter_chicken
rice
okra
and some garbanzo bean thing
the only item i didn't like too much was the butter_chicken
the chicken was dry
the meatballs had a healthy dose of cumin which was a little strong for my taste
the chicken curry was tasty
my favorite menu item was the okra dish
the place is nice inside
i am guessing the fella working there is the owner
not exactly mister personality
but i had the buffet so he didn't have to do much
i read some reviews and i do agree that the prices seem steep for this type of place
for those prices i would like to see some belly_dancers or something
overall i would say better than average food and decent value for the lunch buffet
i was craving_indian_food one evening and my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in north las_vegas
saffron
is still temporarily closed
i was really heading to fresh and easy to pick_up a few items when i spotted indian_curry_bowl
i had been curious about this place for a while and looked up reviews_on_yelp
i remembered the microwave issues yet my man thought that having a large table inside was a good sign
i thought that having only table at pm on a saturday was a bad sign
to make a long story short
we ordered vegetable_samosa
lamb samosa
salty lassi
chai
garlic_naan and sweet and sour curry
by the way
they no longer serve curry bowls
right after we ordered i heard a microwave go on
that's okay probably for my water for my chai
the microwave went on times
now please understand that the kitchen is in the open
if they did cook anything fresh one would hear so
nobody cooked anything fresh
the microwave did all the cooking
the salty lassi was the only item made fresh
my chai had a tea bag
the chicken in our curry was tandoori_chicken cut up in chunks
strange
the samosas lacked flavor and were dry
the chutneys were okay
again
they used a microwave to cook
as for the bill
well we were charged for the garlic_naan that never made it to our table
at the time we ordered
we were the only table being served
by the time we got the bill we were of tables
total of people
my man called him over and said we never got our naan
he looked around on our table to be sure because he didn't remember if he had made naan
really
using a microwave to cook star
cute restaurant
food mediocre and not authentic
i guess this place caters to gringo palates
we ordered samosas which were pretty good
the naan was a bit lacking in flavor
myself and a companion who were familiar with indian_cuisine ordered the matar paneer and vegetable kofta
food wasn't bad
but lacking in spice and deep traditional_indian flavor
this was disappointing as we had specifically requested that our food be very spicy
the rest of our party ordered lamb_korma and chicken_tikka_masala and were generally pleased as they liked their food on the milder side
the owner
who acted as our waiter
was stingy with the rice
he brought us one bowl for five people and gaped at us when we asked for more
mid dinner service
not that we were being greedy
but this was like the size of a cereal bowl
when most indian_restaurants will give you a serving bowl
he then proceeded to bring us half a cereal bowl full of rice then said
ok guys this is all we have
really
he then paced around the restaurant then glared at us until we left
i understand that we came about an_hour before closing
which can be annoying for most restaurant staff
but there were also two other couples dining
way to get your message across
i get it
you want us to get the f ck out
noted
so we quickly finished and left
needless_to_say i will_not_be_returning
i've had better indian food in the backwoods of north carolina
service was fast
food is ok in a pinch if you're desperate
but for me
indian_curry_bowl is to indian food as taco bell is to mexican food
this was our second visit to the indian_curry_bowl
we ate there shortly_after it opened
and decided then never to go back
it was very expensive
especially for the no frills location and decor
there was no one in the place at pm except us
and they still got our order completely wrong
but it's been awhile
and there is a sign that says best of las_vegas
is there a restaurant that isn't on the best of las_vegas list
so we went in for the lunch buffet
the troll that owns the place is almost enough to make you flee in fright
but we suffered through him anyway
there were about different things on the buffet table
two chicken dishes
meatballs and the rest vegetarian_dishes
naan at the beginning of the table should have been enough to make us change our mind
it was charred
flat and dry
but we took a piece anyway
the chicken curry was okay
and the
butter
chicken
whatever that is
wasn't too bad either
however
most of the rest of the dishes were less than good
naan
usually one of our guilty pleasures
was awful
we have eaten in many
many indian_restaurants here and around the world and are very familiar_with_indian_food
bad and good
origin india in las_vegas
in our opinion
is the very best in town
and india_oven is pretty good too
there were only two other tables of people in the restaurant while we were there
at the noon hour
and one of them was eating the food with gusto
i don't want to question their taste
because this place has been open for a couple of years
so there must be some people who like it
however
we don't
and won't be going back
the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
their lamb is cooked_to_perfection
first few times i tried this place
i liked what i usually order which is chicken_korma curry with rice and naan
i'd only go when i'd have the urging for curry and bc it is in my neighborhood
but i'd spend an easy even just for my small lunch and always thought it was overpriced
i was so pleased to see their_lunch_buffet for
during the week
on weekends
i've been twice now and each time i had a little bit of every item
which were all nicely flavored
both times
finished everything on my plate and was super happy
so spending a for weekend buffet
drink and tip was worth to me bc i got to try everything instead of just one item for the same price
service and ambiance there has always been a little lack luster
but they must be reading their reviews bc the old man was no where to be found and the wife was super welcoming and friendly
and they had an attentive bus boy to help out
i think they need some nice indian music_playing to kill the monotony
but i'm glad they are still open and in the neighborhood
i'd recommend trying the buffet during the week for the best deal
we had take out and it was pretty good for las_vegas indian food
we had different dishes and each of them was delicious
the nan was okay
the garlic_nan could of used a little more garlic
overall it was good though
check it out if you are in the area
i go before closing and order the tandori_chicken
they serve it with bell peppers and onions
it ask comes with rice and lemons
i order rai cucumber sauce and garlic_nan
the owner is very friendly and always knows what i want
nice to see a family_run business
the chai ice tea is good too
will try buffet soon
my wife picked_up orders of lamb and chicken_vindaloo and naan
the vindaloo was supposed_to_be level of for heat
it was so bland i would say it was actually level
the naan was very dry and did not even hold together
it was like bread particle board
not a good meal
but it wasn't over
hrs later i began to have the most violent episode of food poisoning i have experienced in years
hours of projectile fluids coming out both ends
i am lucky i was the only one in my family eating the curry_bowl fare
i will never go near the place again
but hey
at least it was too expensive
i have been here times
i don't know why i've chosen to go so many times
but each time has not been a good experience
my old roomie said it was her favorite indian food in town
it must have been the only place she's ever tried
horrible service
very bland food
i was craving indian for lunch
and this was the only place in the northwest at the time
i ordered take out
took longer than i was told
charged me for the extra rice and naan i ordered
but failed to give it to me
again
the food was very bland and watery
they had just advertised a new buffet for lunch
my boyfriend and i had both agreed this place was not very good
but we decided_to_give it one more try for the buffet
horrible service
and very distasteful food
they didn't direct us to anything
just expected us to know how it worked didn't ask us if we needed anything
there was hardly any food to chose from and what there was available was cold and hardly any left
if you've never had indian food
this place will most likely not ever give you a good impression of it
finally there's indian_cuisine in the southwest part of the valley
opened april
and looks promising to me
located on the northeast corner of mcdowell litchfield
contemporary atmosphere
nice stylish square plates
but limited seating
very nice menu with traditional_indian favorites
plus some of the uncommon items that i've found in cities
such as chicago
that offer more diversity in indian_cuisine
for example
i don't normally see bhindi_masala
mushroom palak
and my favorite bombay aloo
beautiful cumin seed spiced potatoes
tandoori breads are reasonably_priced
which is certainly a change from the norm in the west valley
again the menu offers more diversity garlic roti
gobi parantha
paneer naan
in addition to the usual favorites
they're all rather small and circular
flat thin like tortillas though which isn't too exciting
there are about appetizers to choose from
which is a nice change from the west valley competition which offers just a couple
or only offers them on saturday and sunday afternoons
prices overall are quite reasonable
open days a week
for lunch
and dinner
to pm
buffet offered main_course entrees to choose from
with choice of bread
and vegetable_pakoras were a tasty appetizer
only complaint is that the staff owners have a heavy accent and it was difficult to communicate at times
for ethnic cuisine
though
is this such a flaw
we've been twice for the buffet
we are happy to report that sutra has one of the tastiest and most diverse indian_buffets in town
favorites include chicken_tikka_masala and vegetable_pakoras
diners are given a choice of plain or garlic_naan
it's not all raves and applause the bismati rice was a bit over or undercooked
crunchy
on my last visit
and on both occasions the owner's long winded chit chat actually kept us from enjoying our lunch while it was still piping_hot
still
as far as indian restuarants in the valley go
this one is tops
we hope sutra
opened in april
will be a fixture in goodyear
we don't want to go back to driving to glendale or tempe to find decent
or meh
indian cusine
i must say
i am a picky about my indian food
when this place came to goodyear
i was stoked
i have been driving over to bell road to satisfy cravings for indian and that was for mediocre satisfaction
i'm always a bit worried to fall in love with a restaurant
especially in this area
as most are gone within two years
but i did
i have been to sutra seven times now and every_single time i think
god i hope this place makes it
this restaurant has climbed to my top three favorite indian_restaurants
the food is nothing short of amazing
each time
a bit different
but always very good
the buffet is my favorite b c i like to try all of the flavors
they have five vegetarian entrees and three or four meat dishes
there is nothing on the buffet that i wouldn't eat again
the tikka masala sauce is rich and flavorful and is spiced just right
the palak_paneer
they call it something else
is also wonderful
the service has improved since opening and the
son
is very professional and is johnny on the spot
my drink never went below full and i can get in and out in minutes if i need to
it's the
father
who cooks and i think the recipes he has brought to this restaurant are truly unique
if you love indian food
or even if you don't
please check this gem out
and in response to another's comment on seating
it's a nice modern place
well decorated and there is plenty of seating even at noon sharp
when they first opened they were slammed
but things have settled down to normal business now
they also have a full bar with some very interesting wine selections
i take everyone i know there just so they can experience truly excellent indian food
yum
living in laveen
there are not a ton of indian places to visit
unless you want to take a little trip
the bf and i were looking for something different
something we don't normally have
after a little bit of yelping
we found this place
neither one of us have had indian food
and yelpers seemed to like here
so we thought we'd give it a shot
although urban spoon gives completely opposite reviews
we decide
eh why not
i'm super glad we braved it out
because everything was real good
the bf asked what my_favorite_dish was
and i didn't have an immediate response to this question
one bit
food was great
i really liked the flavors
everything we ordered seemed to be tomato based as everything had a redish color
i don't know if this is typical indian food or not
but it could be
anytime the bf and i try something out
we normally order things to try out and of course end up taking a bunch home
but i think it's only fair to us
and to the restaurant in order for us all to get a feel for each other
i wish i had a pen and pad so i can say what we had
but i'll try to describe as much as possible
we had a lamb dish that was served in a tomato sauce with potatoes
and i ended_up calling this my favorite
come to think of it this is actually the only one i didn't know
i know it was in the lamb section of the menu towards the bottom
then we went with the chicken something masala
they have a regular masala
and we went with the one with words
haha
it was very good too
little bit oily
and the chicken to me was very dry
almost flakey
then we went with the beef curry just in case we didn't like the other too
this dish was real good too
we ordered this with a side of rice
which was fantastic
i loved the rice
its basamati rice
was very fluffy and light
i loved that the rice didn't take over my whole meal and fill me up before i could enjoy each dish
sauce
is more what i'd call it
considering you really need the rice
all in all
we'll definitely go back here
i guess until we actually try another indian spot on our way home from work or something
the place is small
they had cute plates
a little bar
that seems as if it will grow if the people come
i can see upgrading the stars with time
and experience
oh_yeah
those things
plus the rice came to just under
so definitely sweet on the pocket
delicious indian food
as good as the dhabas in india and los angeles
my family was so excited_to_see this place open
i do hope it makes it
go there and try for yourself
you will find amazing food
great service
and a television for your sports viewing pleasure
they also have a full bar
which is an added plus
my fellow goodyear avondale peeps get out of the chains and support this local gem
after spending many years living in silicon valley
i couldn't wait for an indian restaurant to open up in the west valley
it's hard to list a favorite because i loved everything i tried
garlic_naan
shrimp_vindaloo
curry chicken
karahi lamb
etc
don't forget to try the mango_lassi and kheer if you have a sweet tooth
they're family_owned and operated and all great people
i love the decor and ambiance
and i can't_wait_to_try their_lunch_buffet and their beers from india
one word
wow
having moved to buckeye after years of living in boston
ma
i have been suffering miserably without my weekly fix of indian food
this place is not just great
but better than most indian_restaurants i have tried in downtown phoenix
i really hope this place stays afloat
as vegetarians
my boyfriend and i ordered the mushroom bhajii and the beingan bertha
sorry for any misspellings
both were excellent
we also had the vegetable_pakora and garlic_naan and everything was equally as good
waitstaff were super_nice and friendly and genuinely concerned about how we liked our food
we went on a sunday_night and there were lots of diners
though still plenty of seating
it's a great size
and i really enjoyed the music
very non descript location in a shopping plaza
but then what would arizona be without that
check_this_place_out
you_will_not_be_disappointed
i plan to return again and again and again
very excited
just got home from here
my first time eating indian
i am quite happy
it will stick with me like thai food
i will crave it at least weekly now
the only part i wasn't impressed with was the chicken_biryani
it tasted like rice a roni a little
it smelled like heaven though
we had garlic_naan and another chicken dish
but i can't remember_the_name
it was very good
i had the mango_lassi
very good
they also brought us what the owner called
indian doughnuts
they were like wet doughnut holes
very good
but very sweet
i could only eat one
i am going to go for the buffet next time
so i can try a little of everything
i recommend trying it
they may not make it
we were the only ones in there the whole time we ate
i hope more people go
it is worth it
it was the first time for my husband and i to try indian_cuisine
we both liked it very much
yes
we will_be_coming_back to this place
we ordered the non_veg assorted snack
seesh kebab
fish pakoras chicken pakoras
for an appertizer
the seesh kebab was minced lamb mixed with spcies cooked on skeker in clay_oven
not like the normal kebab you think it is
the taste was different
not my cup of tea
but the fish and chicken parkora was very good
for our entrees ordered up a karahi lamb boti masala
boneless tansoori lamb in a tomatoe and butter gravy
and chicken_biryani
basmati_rice with chicken cooked with nuts
herbs
raisins
and spices
the karahi lamb dish was served as medium and the chicken_biryani was served as mild
the lamd dish was too hot for me
but then i am a super lightweight
but the flavor was good
i loved my chicken_biryani
the aromatic rice
herb
and spices was just wonderful to smell and taste
the waitress suggested the garlic_naan bread
it was like a pita with small chunks of garlic and herb
it was very tasty too
we got to chatting with the owners
they were very patience to explain what everything was and give us different sauces to try
cucumber yogurt
minty cream
etc
with our dishes
they also brought out a sample of the kheer
rice_pudding
my husband inhaled it
he loved it
yes
so happy to find indian food in the southwest part of the valley
went here for the lunch buffet good selection of vegetarian and non vegetarian_options
my favorite was the chicken_tikka_masala really flavorful and tender i was able to cut through it with a fork
i'll_definitely_be_back
okay
it almost seems a shame to burst the bubble of the positive_reviews of this place
but i just have to
i'm not an indian food expert
but i am a serious enthusiast and i've eaten at dozens of indian places on three continents
not to mention my family being from the vicinity of that area of the world and therefore having grown up on curry and rice and all things spice
we went here for lunch yesterday
sunday
thanks to a yelp aloqa recommendation after we'd had a romp at estrella mountain park and were starving
the place was almost deserted at pm
with only one other table occupied fair enough
we went for the buffet
and i have to say
it was simply
okay
the buffet didn't have a particularly wide_variety of stuff several items were cheap regulars such as the saag and the dhal spinach and lentils for the uninitiated
they did have aloo zucchini
never seen that before tasted okay
about as good as i'd have been able to make it
and that's actually not a compliment
no lamb dishes disappointing
but unfortunately this is also rare
flavorwise
i found it boring and unspectacular
saag is saag
tandoori_chicken is tandoori_chicken
except their chicken was very light on the tandoori smoke flavour
none of the food left the slight zing on my tongue that it should have
rice was okay
but then you typically can't_go_wrong with cooking basmati
although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on this count
we had our almost year_old along and he did have a little rice
chicken and beef it was his first real curry and thus a pretty substantial milestone for us
then the wife went to get a little kheer and a gulab_jamun ball
the kheer was watery but tasted okay compared unfavourably to the sabudaana kheer at india_palace
the jamun ball was almost completely solid you had to press real hard with a fork to cut it
normally they're nice and soft and soaked
however
another one i got was normal so it was just the luck of the draw there
beef curry was nice
although the first piece i ate was mainly fat whatever
you get that and i don't mind it
the fried pakoras can normally be cut through with a fork
these you had to saw through with a knife not great
chewy to the point of almost being crunchy
no samosas in the buffet
the naan was unusual
i've had a lot of naan before and this stuff was the uncommon kind
not thick and pita ey but instead a little more like a roti
it tasted very fresh we had plain and also garlic and the wife really liked it
kid did too
i personally prefer the other sort of naan softer and a little more substance to it
but this one had merit regardless
however
it took at least fifteen minutes after our food was served before the naan arrived
all up
middle of the road as far as i'm concerned
although the wife quite liked it
note that this is for the buffet only we did not have a la_carte and perhaps the to order cooked food may have tasted better
i've had better buffets the best one in phoenix west of the imo is india_palace a wider variety
a lot busier
as a result
i'm sure
and more flavourful food
admittedly
i haven't tried any other_indian_places south of bell but west of the except for sutra
bell appears to have most of them
i would normally have given this place a flat three stars
but i'm going to give it an extra half and round up for a few reasons
firstly
the waiter was real nice and very attentive up to the standard of a typical us chain place
rather than the silent wanderers with the easter island statue facial expressions at other buffets who do no more than refill your water and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or so
he was asking us how we were doing
offered refills of my wife's iced_tea at appropriate times etc
spot on
next
there's a buffet discount where all kids under are however
we noticed that they appropriately knocked the price down to
for us
unbidden and i guess for the simple reason that he was set up in a high chair and obviously only ate of a breakfast bowl worth of food in total
third
the place had nice decor
although i was a bit concerned there were no tablecloths
with my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh t all over the tabletop
and thankfully they didn't have sh tapple wudda wudda waa waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in a cheap attempt at making you feel like you're actually in india
i'd eat here again
but only if i'm in the area and dying for indian food
it simply didn't measure up
either buffet wise or flavour wise
for first timers
i can see how they would have enjoyed the experience clean seating_area
americanized flavours and a good waiter
my experience
however
has been burned in over almost four decades and i've kicked the tyres of more cuisines from this area of the world than i can recount
especially indian
three and a half
rounded up to four
seacrest out
this review is for the buffet
typical buffet food
i had saag
bombay potatoes
tandoori_chicken
curry chicken and pakoras
i think they must leave out the spices for the buffet in case first timers come in
the saag was good
but it wasn't anything special
bombay potatoes were just meh
this was however
the first indian buffet i have been to where the tandoori_chicken was not dry as a bone
it was actually juicy
props for keeping the bones in the curry chicken
although there seemed to be more bone than meat
and the pakoras
bleh
i ordered a roti and a parantha
it was the weirdest roti i had ever seen
i am going to agree with dean ryan s and say it looked like a mix of roti and naan
it wasn't horrible though
the parantha on_the_other_hand was dry and almost burned
i was there by myself and the young guy and older woman were both very friendly
at first the guy was making conversation with me keeping me entertained but then he went in the back
i'd return perhaps for dinner
but since i don't live here i doubt that will happen
best indian restaurant i've been to in forever
i was spoiled by the great places in england
sutra is as good if not better
great flavors and use of spices
super friendly_staff
extensive_menu
if you are in the vicinity you've got to check_this_place_out
we stopped by for our first experience of indian food a little more then a week ago
there was only my husband and i and one other couple in the whole place
the one waiter spent the entire time talking to the other couple
we ordered drinks that we never actually received
at the suggestion of our waiter who was friendly in the few minutes he actually spent speaking with us
we had the buffet
it seemed very very bland
i was really excited_to_try indian food because i'd heard such wonderful things about the flavors
we will be trying indian food again
but never from here
my wife and i love us some good curry
we went here on a double date and i like the cafe type atmosphere
we were the only ones in the restaurant for the first min
the food was pretty good
warning
these_guys are serious about spicy
medium is a normal person's hot and hot is
wow i'm gonna feel that tomorrow kind of hot
the chicken seemed really fatty to me and not cooked enough for my tastes but i like my chicken well done
since its the only real indian place on_the_west_side we'll probably go there again
i was running errands and hungry
so i stopped in to get some lunch
oh my goodness everything in the lunch buffet was amazing
i am new to indian food
but i love it
this place is great
sutra here sits in a large shopping_center
i would describe it as a stylish
mid sized cafe
there's a full bar
which features several special wines
plus beer varieties
along with the usual well drinks
the salad_bar had the expected chopped lettuce
sliced tomatoes
cucumbers
purple onions the chopped salsa like topping mix
the name of which escapes me
there were also lemon slices
cut the right direction
chunks of cantaloupe
the naan_bread was warm but plain
there were mostly the usual dishes
including chicken_tikki_masala
tandoori_chicken
something i hadn't seen before was egg burgy
minced
curried egg with onion
whatever it was
it was good
for me
though
there was nothing particularly exciting about this place
having both medium and large plates out was a nice_touch
the matronly server lady was friendly attentive
the lunch buffet is
it's
a ok
this is the first time i have tried this restaurant
and the atmosphere is very pleasant
dinner was amazing the soup
the bread
and the curry chicken were just fantastic
the spices and flavors perfect
the staff was very nice and helpful
i am recommending sutra to all of my friends
and my family
i will definitely be returning to enjoy this fine indian_cuisine again and again
it is also reasonably_priced and very clean
it's just ok
i've lived in india and would have to say this is an american version of indian food
otherwise
i guess it would be quite tasty had i not visited india
probably would not re visit
nor recommend
attempted to have dinner here tonight
but appears they were closed
no signs confirming
but pm on a thursday and not open makes one think they are gone
if i find this to be in error i will remove this review comment
we chose to go to india garden on dysart instead
very strong first impression
superior dining_experience
the decor is embellished and thoughtful
the food was very tasty
lunch buffet review to follow in an update
for dinner
though
lamb_curry
medium spicy
vegetable_samosa
of them as appetizer
garlic nann and
yes
mixed pickle
and a bottomless coke for around
i felt the quality and quantity of the food was superior
and priced correctly
visitors to las_vegas should appreciate this restaurant
please note
to find this restaurant from the strip
drive on flamingo or tropicana or even spring mountain westward
up the slope
until you get to valley view
turn right
northward
and drive to sahara at the stop light with the rebel gas station
at the stop light
intersection of valley view and sahara
turn right again
going down the slope
back toward the strip
the restaurant is immediately on your right
right next to the rebel gas station
in the same parking_lot as marianna's supermarket
please do not attempt to turn left against traffic on sahara at any time of the day in an uncontrolled intersection
you'll be thankful for both the dining and the driving experience
enjoy and make sure to review this restaurant
i and co_workers tried this place for lunch
i was anticipating this place opening as soon as i saw the sign that it was an indian restaurant and had lunch buffet so when it finally opened
we had to go
it did_not_disappoint
the lunch buffet is
and there is a great selection of food
it's not the best indian that i've had but for the value
it is excellent
the thing i also appreciated was the naan was included with the meal and you didn't have to pay extra for it as i had at other indian_restaurants
they give you a choice of either plain or garlic so we went with garlice
it was awesome
hot and fresh from the oven
had herbs and plenty of garlic to our liking
the service was great as well as the servers attended to our table and made sure our drink glasses were never empty
they checked regularly to ask how everything was
all of us left very full and happy with our experience at mt
everest
we will definitely be returning regularly for lunch
we went the st day they were open and it was fantastic
easily the most variety of indian food offered
curries
tons of veggie dishes
for a lunch buffet around town and the price is unbeatable
service was friendly and extremely attentive which prob had to do w this being their grand opening
i left stuffed beyond belief
highest quality indian lunch buffet
wow
very tasty food
spicy enough for most americans
though not so spicy for many from the region
twelve bucks with drink and tax
very impressive restaurant
this place has a great variety of indian dishes
we were here for the lunch buffet and were not disappointed
the naan_bread was a little fatty and not as crisp as i hoped it would be but all other dishes made up for it
we will be back for sure
i took the family for the lunch buffet and it was the best indian buffet in las_vegas
i had been to just about every indian_buffet_in_town before getting a recommendation from a friend
the place was clean
the food was well_stocked
and the fresh naan that's included with the
was excellent
particularly good was the chicken_tikka_masala
since my kids liked it
i will_be_going_back there often
amazing
amazing food
even better price
forget spending
at a casino buffet when you can eat here for lunch
trust_me
the service is amazing
i love waiters that fill your drink glass without you asking
well
lets just say my glass was always full
this place is really really really reaaly good
it was a
yelp it to get off the strip
find
everything made fresh and
instant
see the naan on the menu
the buffet is for lunch only and yes
it had some weird decor
a couple of electriic guitars and a neon billiards sign
go here
eat here
love it
i have eaten here about ten times now
and it is a pretty new restaurant
so that is saying something especially since i am a very picky eater
at lunch you can either have the buffet or order from the menu
at dinner you order from the menu
many of the items on the lunch buffet vary from day to day some days there will be chana_masala
some days vegetable_korma
etc
it's always great
i actually like ordering from the menu better
though
the owner is a very nice guy and works hard to make sure his customers have everything they need
i have introduced several people to this place
and they all come here regularly now
and some of them are pretty picky people
too
i give a star for the food and service
my wife and i were a bit hesitant when we only saw others eating in the restaurant
also it looks like a converted burger_king and the decor is a bit drab
but decided to try it anyway
we had great dishes and the naan was excellent
if you can overlook the very basic decor and consider the food end service
this place is great
we would eat here again
a note to the owners if you read this
get rid of the florescent lighting and add more soft lighting
maybe get spend a bit to warm up the atmosphere and you will have a winner restaurant
good luck
prices seemed mid range for indian_cuisine
i think we had two dishes and naan totaling about before taxes
very fair for quality food
when i saw mt_everest getting ready to open i was initially a little put off by the locale in a defunct burger_king building
next to a gas station
in a grotty parking_lot outside marianna's mexican supermarket on west sahara
eventually we tried the extremely reasonably_priced lunch buffet for
and were immediately blown_away by the quality and variety of food here
i am a meat_eater and my wife is a vegatarian
but there is so much for both of us
the chicken_makhani and chicken_tikka_masala
these two rotate so you will get either one of the other
are both wonderful and there's always a few delicious vegetable dishes that are cooked and seasoned to perfection
vegetables that i would never consider eating elsewhere are somehow transformed into pure delights
also excellent is the selection of pakora and the large
delicious samosas
i usually manage to polish off three of these
freshly cooked naan
so fresh you almost burn your hands if you aren't careful
is so good you could make a meal out of it and some of the sauce from the buffet alone
our hosts usually offer us our choice of plain or garlic_naan or even both
they are eager to please their customers here at mt_everest
quite often i can tell when an indian restaurant is going to be good by the number of indian people eating there mt_everest attracts a diverse mix of clientele
yet does not fall into the trap of becoming too westernised
if i have one small criticism it is that gulab_jamun
a personal favourite
never seems to appear as the dessert on the buffet
but this is an extremely minor complaint
the dinner menu_is_extensive with as many as ten options for each base type of food
veg
chicken
lamb etc
at dinner you get a free serve of papadums along with well priced servings that were a good cheaper_than in some of the local competitor restaurants and possible twice the size extremely good value and the dinner time butter_chicken could be the best i have ever tasted
note
you might want to look over all star reviews of mount_everest
and for that matter
all vegas indian_restaurants
with a critical eye
you'll notice they are often from people who have written no other real reviews
i strongly suspect there's some
review wars
going on between different establishments
you'll notice they will always claim that staff are
rude
disrespectful
etc
there isn't an indian_restaurant_in_vegas i have been to where the staff have been anything short of gracious to the point of humble and mt_everest is no exception
don't believe the bogus reviews that claim otherwise
this is an extremely good indian restaurant
the chefs certainly know their way around a spice rack
my_favorite_dish so far is the vegetable_korma
i'd suggest ordering a side of garlic_naan with your meal
since it's hands_down the best naan in town
i highly_recommend this restaurant
fail to understand the yelp hype here
very standard north_indian restaurant
solid
and in the top half of that category
but not star by any stretch
only a couple of nepalese dishes
vegetable chow chow was kind of lame
just a few chopped peppers and onions
there are too many indian_restaurants bringing the same menu and they all blend together
india is a huge country
especially when you're including neighboring countries like nepal
and it has a vast variety of cuisines and styles
somebody please bring something more adventurous than saag_paneer and chicken_tikka_masala
good solid indian food
the lunch buffet is an amazing deal
the food is always made to order
dinner and take out is always great
would recommend this restaurant to any one craving_indian_food
don't judge a book by it's cover
they got new windows that makes them look closed hehe
we love_this_place
great selection
changes per day
good thing because we do come here consecutively
the service is friendly_and_attentive
lunch buffet
wow
for the low maintenance diner
i've been to mt_everest several times for lunch
buffet
and dinner
and have been pleased on each visit
i had dinner there about week ago
portions were large
food was good quality
service was fast and friendly
overall definitely recommended
don't let the location put you off
i've been here over a dozen times for both lunch and dinner and have left happy each time
definitely try the buffet for lunch
food is hot
fresh
and tasty
you get both plain and garlic_naan as part of the meal
all for
dinner is great as well
lamb and chicken dishes were quite tasty
the only dish which has disappointed was the tandori which was flavorful but overcooked and dry
i've tried it twice with the same result so i'm sticking with the curries
this place hits the spots and location is a little dirty looking on the outside
but inside clean and totally different atmosphere
they impressed my friend that they use real table clothes at lunch
it is off the strip
no casino buffet line here
prices are great and food is tasty too
if you have few friends get the coupon on their web site to get a discount
lunch was hot and fresh
and we got garlic and plain_naan
with our meal
oh yummy
and you have to splurge and get the mango_lassi again yummy
i had dinner here tonight
it was my first visit
i had the lamb saag and an order of garlic_naan
i really enjoyed my meal
i asked for it to be spicy
it was a little mild for me
but it was still very good
i'll be back to try the lunch buffet to get a mix of their food
a luncheon with my fellow yelpers
misti y
and blair t
at mt
everest india's_cuisine was just delightful
this indian canteen is clean
but small
the variety of food choice was short
but it was good
they had cuisine choice for predators and plant eaters
my favorite is their nan basket that they brought out from the back
which is delivered to your table as you sit_down with your food
i like this concept because some indian_buffets will have the nan sitting on the buffet to be grabbed individually
the mt_everest way
keeps the nan fresh and savory by delivery
the big plus is that they offer a coupon to purchase buffets and get free
which is good until may
you can redeem this online http

i will_be_coming_back and especially being located close to my office
i had a fabulous lunch here with yelp's misti and honey
i'm not an indian food expert i'd defer you to misti's review if_you're_looking for technical insight on the food quality
overall i was quite impressed
this will be my new go to indian food buffet spot for lunch
with coupon
is definitely a great price for the quality level
as the other ladies mentioned the naan basket is out_of_this_world
garlic and plain
yes please
i might have eaten like half the basket sorry girls
i should also mention despite the location and the shady looking exterior
the inside is neat and clean and very spruced up
don't let the location scare you this place is worth the investment
a great steal for lunch buffet
person
gets you fresh garlic butter nan_bread
every item in the menu was great
with a great selection from about items on the table
ample parking space about miles from strip
my fav lunch destination in vegas
had the buffet and it was among the best indian_buffets i've ever had
and i try to test them all out
the service was a bit strained
because there was only one person doing everything
being a buffet
that didn't really matter too much
but a little more attentiveness would have been nice
i saw a review about it being too cold
but when we went
it was super hot and humid in the restaurant
so much that we wanted to hurry and get out
if it is like that every time
it will definitely put me off of going in the future
edit
i've been back for the buffet probably times since this initial review and things have been great ever since
i'm upgrading to stars
i loooove this place
veggie_options are very good here
i love the basmati_rice
it is cooked_to_perfection
i have been here many times and they have different options in veggie dishes
my last visit they had an excellent cabbage dish which was sauteed in yummy herbs and spices
curry
makes the world go around
the world go around
the world go around
curry
makes the world go around
it makes the world go 'round
money
from cabaret
with some slight changes
there's a reason indian restaurant lunch_buffets are so popular all the curry you can eat and lots of varieties
mt_everest knows it and does a great job with its buffet
options of vegetarian curry
lamb_curry
chicken curry anchor the buffet offerings and they are all tasty
although a little lacking in spice
those looking to set the
roof
of their mouth
on fire
will be a little disappointed
what makes mt everest's buffet exceptional are the additional offerings delicious samosas
sweet sticky rice
soft basmati_rice and free
warm
garlic_naan on the table
all of which makes this the best indian_buffet_in_town
outstanding
my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in las_vegas
very busy during the lunchtime buffet
evening dinners are more relaxed and comfortable
what's up with me
indian_buffets in days
that must be a first for me
i don't think i've been to one for six months prior to this
my craving for the indian buffet had not been satiated by my visit to mint and so i was determined to have a good experience today
after extensive research on yelp i decided to try mt
everest
a co_worker of mine agreed to join me
ditching his diet
thanks to the fact that shari s had described the naans here as being
billowy
we made the long mile trudge to mt_everest from the office
this buffet is seriously amazing
for a little tiny place charging
per_person
it seriously hit every craving and made us happy campers
there is an extensive vegetarian selection in the buffet
soft basmati_rice with peas
palak_paneer
punjabi kadi
malai_kofta
dhal
cauliflower and potato stirfry
sambar
idly
samosas
pakoras and a myriad of chutneys
yogurt
salad and dips
i have only good things to say about every_single dish on the buffet
tasted good and the ingredients were all fresh
indian_buffets frequently omit primo dishes like paneer
indian cottage_cheese cubes
kofta
indian dumplings in gravy
samosas and fresh
not frozen
veggies in their food
mt
everest did no such thing
they spared no expense and made this buffet experience fantastic
my co_worker who eats meat couldn't stop raving about the creamy chicken_makhani
lamb_curry and the samosas
he went pretty crazy with all the chutneys
and yes
the garlic naans that came with the buffet
we asked for garlic
were billowy
and extremely tasty
my only gripe with mt
everest is the dessert selection
they had sweet_rice
which really is a cop out dessert
but i settled for their fresh fruit selection
oranges and watermelon
i would give these_guys a
stars
taking off a half star for the dessert
but since i can't on yelp
they get a four
next time
if they serve gulab_jamun i will be more than happy to up it to a no questions asked star_review
it's truly heartwarming to see an indian buffet keep it's quality consistent even after being open a while
mt
everest really did warm my heart and brought back some of my lost hope in the indian buffet genre in las_vegas
thanks to all the yelpers that did a wonderful job describing this place
you guys were spot on
the buffet is pretty good compared to all the other indian_buffet_in_town
but you really have to try some of the stuff off the menu
the vindaloo and jalab gamun were excellant
i also tried the chai here
but it left something more to be disired
all in all
its always a positive experience here
and like everyone says
you have to try the garlic_naan bread
i'm not down for indian
but i gave it a try
i unfortunately eat with my nose
too
and i cannot stand the smell of curry
but i tried
the plus for those who don't like indian_cuisine but are forced to eat at an indian restaurant is the naan
eat lots of it
it's awesome
i gave a based_on the bread and the lamb
lamb was good and not too overwhelming
ignore my review
though
it's not fair because i'm biased
lunch buffet was mediocre
flavors were good but meat quality was below average
service was average
nothing special here
as a kid i used to hang out with a lot of guys from sri lanka and malaysia and this place reminded_me_of the food they made
i didn't look at the menu much on this visit because that buffet called to me
teasing my nose like a cartoon depiction of the smell of food tickling scooby's nose
the curry selection here is fantastic and so are all the other dishes on the buffet
this is definitely my favorite indian_cuisine restaurant now and i will come here anytime my better half lets me lol
i'm not an_expert_on_indian food
it's probably not even on my list of top cuisines
maybe every or years i'll have a craving_for_indian_food
i'm more of a japanese or thai curry person
after today's meal at mt_everest i will b eating more indian curries
the lunch buffet was really good
everything was hot and fresh
the naan_bread both garlic and plain was super
everything i ate i enjoyed daal
tandoori chix
some spinach and cheese dish a lot of other foods don't remember the names
service was attentive and the restaurant look alot better inside then out
i think it was a burger_king in it's former life
like i said not an_expert_on_indian food
but this was goooood
there are already plenty of reviews
so i'll focus on the korma sauce
it's a creamy concoction of special magnificence
whenever this buffet has anything with korma
i have to eat it
the sauce is rich
slightly spicy
and quite magical
everything else is also tasty and the bollywood videos are hypnotizing
my_only_complaint is that on several occasions the service has been rather grumpy
a bit sketchy on the outside
and thankfully i did not judge the book by its cover
buffet had many good options and was a steal at only
naan was among the best i had in vegas this trip
the korma sauces were rich and flavorful
just as other yelpers mentioned
i think the one i had was cheese cubes with peas
and it was quite delectable
this is by_far_the_best_indian lunch buffet i ever had in vegas
the service was amazing and restaurant itself it clean and quiet
most indian restaurants' lunch buffet are dishes from days_ago
at mt_everest i could really taste the flavor of different spices they use and the meat dishes were tender but not too soft
the curry dishes were just perfect
enough sweetness but also taste the kick of other spices they use
i truly believe this place roast their own spices and grind it up themselves also
loved the place
glad we found it on yelp because the outside isn't very inviting
i'd definitely pass the place if i saw it since it looks very plain and the buiding is aging
first
the price is great at under for the lunch buffet
the manager and staff were very nice and attentive
we were seated_right_away
so no wait around pm
i tried everything
the chicken curry
chicken_korma
veggie_korma
palik paneer
dahl
soup
rice_pudding
etc
with a hot indian chai
the veggie_korma was very creamy and seemed even better than the chicken
though the chicken was really good
this isn't diet food and we had a very light dinner since we were full all day
i saw some people get the buffet to go
which seemed like a good idea
at
you meet or beat the price of most other lunch spots
other stuff
chai was as it should be
nothing super special
but i'd order again
the garlic_naan was different
but we prefer regular naan
the garlic changes the flavor of the food too much
regardless
it's nice having warm
fresh naan brought to your table instead of having it sit on the buffet
due to our complete
total satisfaction
the price and friendliness of staff
i'm giving a rare stars
stars is really giving the benefit of the doubt here
i would say service was a solid stars
although there was a bit of the soft upsell here on beer and extra side items like multiple orders of naan
but food was stars
stars tops
i really like the strong and bold flavors of indian_cuisine
and also the quality of the sauces
which tend to be very smooth
with supporting notes of texture like cashew or other items to provide some 'tooth' to a dish
i found the sauces here to be very heavy
a bit 'gloppy' and just lacking in quality the sauces just weren't inviting to me
actual taste of the sauces was ok serviceable
but nothing great
also
lamb was pretty tough
and chicken had small bones
the kinds that should not be in a dish
small enough to catch in one's throat and cartiledge just unappetizing
paneer dish we had was one of the better items
but sauce still had that heavy and unpleasant texture
i have not yet found an indian_restaurant_in_vegas that measures up to origin india in its heyday
went here for the lunch buffet a couple of days_ago
it wasn't bad
but it wasn't my favourite
i will
however
come back again for sure in the near future as i know the nature of indian buffet is to constantly rotate the types of food
for those just trying out indian for the first time
there will be at least some thing there you will like
the place was clean
white table cloths and stemmed water goblets on all the tables
and they are very attentive to the used plates and the empty water
worth the price for sure
wow
i'm going to be the black sheep here and give this restaurant only two stars
when my husband and i entered for lunch a few days_ago
the manager or owner was talking on the phone
we stood by politely waiting
until he pointed us to sit with his chin the phone still strapped to his ear
never once addressing or welcoming us to sit by words
i was surprised
but didn't say anything
the restaurant itself was really dark inside
there were no lights turned on at all
just a little natural light coming from the small heavily curtained windows
nice surroundings and kind interactions make food taste better in my line of thinking
so this restaurant just failed in these respects
the buffet itself was fine
nothing was amazing nor was anything bad
after we sat with our food
the same manager brought a basket of naan and actually tossed it down onto our table as he walked by without even making eye contact with us
still jabbering away on his phone
my husband and i just looked at each other and laughed
it was that bizarre
needless_to_say
i will not be going back
there are other indian_buffets in town that serve great food
have an inviting ambiance and treat me like a valued customer
i visited this restaurant in june
and i had their_lunch_buffet
the food was excellent
and their prices reasonable for good indian_cuisine
i would_definitely_go_back there when i return to the vegas area
o happy days
when on site at my client in las_vegas i cannot wait for my lunch break so i can jet down to mt
everest india cuisine for my much needed indian food fix
i became aware of this place after searching yelp for an indian restaurant and have never looked back
the restaurant is just a couple of minutes away from my work site so the lunch buffet works out really well
i can immediately sit_down
order my plain naan_bread and start dishing up
the food is always flavorful and there are always very many options to choose from
they take care of the vegetarian and the meat lovers between us
i take particular joy in the chana_masala at this venue a delight which is shared by one of the waiters who told me this a while ago
i love the fact that i can go back to scoop some more of any indian curry with which i can enjoy the remainder of my naan_bread
i have ordered a chicken_tikka_masala take out with mt
everest before and that sparked off my 'must have' mindset with which i now approach every trip to las_vegas
i confess that i will easily come here more than once per single work week because that is how good the food is
and as for the price you will hardly ever convince me of better value_for_money elsewhere
we went here for dinner about a month ago
we had the samosa chat for an app
cubed samosa with yogurt and mint sauce
it was good but i'd probably try something different next time
seems like it's made out of leftover samosas
we also got raita which was good but a little tarter than i like
the garlic_naan was yummy
for main_courses we had prawn biriyani and mateer paneer
the prawn biriyani was tasty though the rice was on the al dente side
the matter_paneer had a nice sauce
the dinner was good overall
but there are better indian_restaurants_in_town
not an_expert_on_indian cuisine but i love_this_place
very tasty food
the waiter
owner
has always been very kind and has dishes prepared as i like them
i never see any crowds here and never have seen more than a few tables with people at them
i don't know why and its a shame
but thumbs_up from me
i really hope it stays in business
i've visited other local indian places
this one is by far my favorite so far
really good quality indian dishes
especially spicy ones
can be hard_to_find and they go downhill really fast if not prepared with care
i had never tried indian food before and there's no better way to try it for the first time than to come here for their_lunch_buffet
prices_are_very_reasonable
and the selection is pretty extensive
there were at least different vegetarian currey options and different meat options
all the food was very fresh with tons of flavor
you're instantly smacked in the face with all the different aromas of the indian spices as soon as you enter the restauarant
the service was also great
my_water_glass never got more than half empty before someone was by to refill it
i was very impressed
i think my favorite part of the whole experience was the naan basket
they give you a basket of what looks like toasted pita_bread
but it's so much better
it comes plain and with garlic and wow the garlic_naan was soo good
i could probably just sit there and eat that all day
overall
this was a good first experience
a little overwhelming since i didn't know what half of the food was
but it all tasted delicious
today was my second visit to this restaurant
and like my last visit
i was thoroughly impressed
the cost of the all_you_can_eat buffet is
and it's worth_every_penny
i'd be willing to be a couple of dollars more
it would still be an excellent deal
the decor is nice
nothing special
but it's white table cloth and clean
the service and attention that your given is excellent
the food is absolutely fabulouso
the lamb will melt in_your_mouth
the curried dishes are absolutely_delicious and there is a great deal of variety so if your a vegetarian you'll be very happy
the food is hot and very fresh and naan_bread was quite tasty
i'll be going back to this restaurant again and again
i came here with my husband about an_hour before closing time
i don't usually like going to restaurants last minute but i have been craving_indian_food for awhile
i really wanted to try a lamb dish even though i've never been a big_fan of it in the past
i've always thought the taste of lamb had a weird after taste
i tried the lamb vindoolo
which is cooked with potatoes and chilly sauce
the lamb was tender and surprisingly no weird after taste
it was really good
i also had a mango_lassi that was super delicious
i'm glad it came in a clean glass because at bollywood they gave me a glass with a whole bunch of fingerprints all over it
that was a turn off
my husband had a salad with garlic_naan
the salad tasted great with the naan but too sour without it
the naan came out hot and had a nice garlicky taste to it
we didn't feel rushed even though we came in an_hour before closing time
the service is attentive
quick
and friendly
buffet doesn't_look_like it will be tasty but all of it is very good
plus the garlic_nan bread is the bomb
i found great review from fellow yelpers about this restaurant but never gotten a chance to try it out until last week
wow
i'm glad i did
i have lived in vegas for half a decade already and this is by_far_the_best_indian buffet restaurant in vegas
the price is reasonable
but the food is what made them apart from other_indian_places
the tandoori_chicken was flavorful and moist
other places tends to have dried_out chicken
and the curries were awesome
they removed the bone from the chicken and lamb curries so it was so much easier to eat and not bite into one of those small bones
so many other varieties
so little time and stomache space
i wish they were closer to where i live
the service was alright
we couldn't understand what one of the waiters was saying but he main guy was super_nice
we waited for about min for the food to arrive
i had the lamb_korma and my husband had lamb vindoolo and we shared some traditional and garlin naan_bread with a cup of chai
the spice was perfect
my husband had the hot and i has medium
hot enough for him and just a little kick for me
perfect d i'd come back again in a heart beat
according to my indian roommate
this place is ok
however
when she is comparing the food to her mom's home cooking
that means the place is pretty legit
we stopped by to check out the lunch buffet
you can't really beat it for
lots of food
plenty of curries
veggie
chicken
lamb
samosas
buttered chicken
etc
the naan was really good
they brought it out piping_hot from the kitchen
i'm not the best person to ask about indian food
but i thought it was good
so i would def come back
went to mt_everest again last week and noticed that some items were changed
so i'm not sure if they have different items each day or not
no goat_curry
bummer
anyway
the food were not as good as the last time i tried it
i mean
it's not bad
it's just not as good to be rated stars
anyway
last week experience deserved only star
so i kinda averaged it out to be star
great local place off the strip for indian food buffett
have been twice and love it
i used to come to this building all the time
when it was a burger_king
this was my first visit since mt
everest took over
i went for the lunch buffet
the selections were somewhat limited
but the food was pretty good
they bring naan to the table
those who have eaten at other indian_buffets know that this is a nice_touch
because it seems that you always have to wait and fight for the naan if it is on the buffet line
the workers were friendly and efficient with water refills and plate removal
strangely though
they did not come to refill the soft_drinks
like i said
this used to be a burger_king
with that being considered
the decor was nice
the white tablecloths are a nice_touch
the parking situation can be a bit dicey as it is located in front of a busy market
i love indian food but we usually go to india_palace so when i got a off coupon
we decided to try them out
i am so glad_we_did
their prices seem to be slightly lower than india_palace and their portions were definitely much larger
we had the vegetable_samosa to start it was a tad salty but with the two chutneys
they really balanced out
we also had
chili naan was good
not spicy at all
chicken_tikka same as tandoori_chicken but boneless
it was good
some pieces were a little dry but overall pretty good
i don't understand the french fries on top though
that kinda threw me off
hmmm
lamb_vindaloo delish
lamb were actual pieces of lamb
not the ground lamb like some places use
very flavorful
not too gamey
aloo matter potatoes and peas in a sauce
again
large portion and large chunks of potatoes
overall everything was excellent
medium_spice still gave all the entrees a little kick
i just asked for hot_sauce on the side to add to my food since i really like it spicy
will_definitely_be_back
next time with my daughter as i know she will really enjoy it
no butter_chicken on the menu but think i'll try the chicken_korma next
stopped by this unassuming little indian_joint before going to a show a while ago and i found it to be a great find
the restaurant is actually an old burger_king
but the decor inside hides its tragic past
the food was well made and came out quickly
the service was great
the waiter was attentive but never hovered
he even made sure my table knew we ordered both vegetarian and meaty dishes so as to avoid confusion
i would recommend_this_place and happily go back again
we received pappadum plus delicious tamarind and mint sauces to begin our meal and after an exceptionally long wait we received our aloo tiki
deep_fried mashed potatoes
which were overdone and virtually inedible
a few minutes_later the remainder of our meal
chicken makahani
lamb saag
plain basmati_rice and kabuli naan
stuffed with raisins and nuts
appeared
the naan was flat as a pancake and the filling was very bland
both entrees were large and delicious though the lamb was on the tough side
we concluded the meal with a shared portion of carrot_halwa which was a bit too sweet
service
other then by the busboy
was abysmal from start to finish
the sole waiter
i am guessing the owner
sat in a booth across the room from us playing with a cell phone and never once looked in our direction to determine if we or any of the other diners needed anything
i had to call the busboy over to get our check and then it took the waiter an inordinate amount of time to process the payment
i have been going here with my bangladeshi friend for over a year
i found it while going shopping at the mexican market next_door
didn't buy anything
kinda crappy selection
but i was looking for a horchata
anyway
it is not a large selection for a buffet
but the items that they have are very good
there is half for vegetarians and half for meat_eaters
i usually get a lot of the tandori_chicken and lamb with curry
their dessert rice_pudding of some sort is pretty dang good too
i think it is a staple of most indian_restaurants but they do it well here
i usually grab co_workers and use buy get free coupon and pig out once per month during lunch hours
dinner is the same but they dont have the buffet
the place is clean and the nan_bread comes out hot
i told my friends this was a hole_in_the_wall
and it is on the outside
but inside is tastefully done
on the wall is the obligatory indian dramas who dance away the whole time you are eating
read_the_reviews and wanted to give this place a try
bonus this restaurant is on restaurant
com
located in a seedy area of town but very welcoming inside
first thing we ordered was the lamb samosa and was disappointed
way salty
but the garlic_naan and chicken tandoori was yummy
learned something new though
one of my favs 'butter chicken' is called chicken_makhani
up until now i never really liked indian food
especially a buffet
everything just seemed soggy
overcooked and old
this restaurant however
is completely the opposite of my preconceived notion
we went for the lunch buffet
it was amazing
everything was fresh and hot
a very good selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes
most everything i tried was absolutely_delicious
i went back for seconds and even thirds
the next day
i came back for more
the restaurant was clean
the decor tasteful and comfortable
the price was very good too
careful though
all that curry can get to you
this was our first visit to mt
everest
and we went for dinner
the ambience was perfectly okay
not fancy
just a typically decorated indian restaurant with decent lighting
meaning it wasn't too bright
initially
i was put off by the young guy who came to take our drink_orders
he was asian
but not indian
and i could barely understand a word he was saying
i thought he might be nepalese
and it turned out i was right
i don't think he's been in the desert long enough to be dealing with customers
since his english was unintelligible
but by the time he took our food orders
i'd caught onto his rhythm enough to understand and be understood
and by golly
he got the order right
i was happy to see three different thalis on the menu
i like being able to taste a little of everything
we ordered the special mt
everest thali and also a vegetable_biryani
almost everything on the thali was terrific
the appetizer plate came with one very large veggie_samosa
a bunch of very small pakoras
some pieces of ground mean whose name i can't remember
and boneless tandoori_chicken
we were full before the main event
then came the thali platter
on a thali
the dessert is right there on the platter
along with the food
it was supposed_to_be gulab_jamun
which is not a favorite
but instead
there was kheer the rice_pudding and it was the most watery kheer i'd ever tried
we asked if we could have kulfi instead
and were cheerily obliged
the only other problem with the meal was the raita
every indian restaurant makes it differently
but this one was special
especially awful
it was watery
tasted a bit sweet
and just downright peculiar
nevertheless
we packed it up along with our other leftovers
when we opened the container the next night it was fizzy
it got the boot immediately
the biryani was a huge portion of rice
it was well cooked and tasty
but not much in the way of veggies
which made it a big disappointment
overall
we enjoyed the meal and definitely will return
but i don't know what we'll do for raita
love_this_place
i make excuses to be on that side of town mid day so i can do the lunch buffet
delicious
wish i didn't get full so quickly
went the first time with a visiting friend
we had the big sampler deal took home two styro containers
it was even delicious cold the next day
indian_cuisine is not for everyone but if you like it you'll love mt
everest
this place may have tasty indian food but somehow i felt bloated all day after eating here
maybe because of baking soda in the bread
i remember hostel messes in india doing that to keep people from eating too much
i agree with some of the reviewers here that the owner waiter needs to have an attitude makeover
he scowls if people ask for another round of nans
thankfully his cellphone did not go off while we were there
and rice_pudding as a desert
i can't remember when a indian resturant got away with pulling that stunt off
india has so many wonderful deserts and surely rice_pudding is somewhere down at the bottom of that list
if you have to eat indian in lv
maybe this would be my recommendation just because others are worse
mint ok
origin terrible
i guess it's not fair for me to review this place while i didn't get there until the last minute of lunch buffet
i was actually surprised they let us in
food was old and dried by then
but they sure tasted great
next time
i'll come earlier
we spotted when we were just driving by on the way to church
we decided that we'd give it a try on our way back
the exterior doesn't shout yummy indian food
but the interior was nice and clean
i always check the restroom to see how well it is maintained before dining somewhere
it also was quite clean
there are booths against the walls windows with round tables in the center
there were several families and a few couples dining
what i really noticed was that everyone seemed to be having a good time and the conversations from the other tables could not be heard from where we were sitting
i thought that was a plus because you could have a private conversation or laugh at jokes without disturbing anyone else
they did an excellent job at seating their customers throughout the restaurant
all in all
we were impressed with the quality
portions and price of the food
for starters
you get a basket of papadum with two little dipping_sauces
we ordered lamb_vindaloo
classic spicy lamb w potatoes
chicken jel frenzi
chicken with bell pepper
onions
mushrooms in sauce
aloo kauli
potatoes cauliflower
and two orders of naan
garlic keema lamb
the dishes had wonderful sauces with excellent consistency for sopping up with naan
everything was fresh
hot and yummy
the service was good
the waiter never let our_water_glasses get empty
and the food came out as ordered in a timely manner
i will definitely put mt
everest at the top of my list for non franchised indian dining
great atmosphere and even better food
i am not experienced in indian_cuisine
this was my st experience
i had the lunch buffet so i could try a little of everything
the lamb and chicken were moist and tender
and everything was very flavorful
the lunch buffet is a steal at
i was overly impressed by everything at this restaurant
wow
i like indian food
but i am very picky with it and only have made a few dishes at home which i like
my sister and i walked over here while i was getting my windows tinted a_few_weeks_ago and man was i impressed
very much so
i have never been a fan of lamb
but their lamb_curry was to die for
everything i put on my plate was absolutely phenomenal
and the sweet_rice
oh the sweet_rice
i would live on that stuff forever
the service was fantastic
and they were very concerned that we enjoyed everything
the naan was fresh and delicious
i ate two plates full until i was ready to burst
i have decided i love indian food
and am so happy because i was always thinking i wasn't so big on it
i cannot recommend_this_place enough
absolutely_delicious
i went here for lunch buffet and think that its an an ok for an indian lunch
its not over the top but its not bad either
very limited items
tandoori_chicken a little too dry
the lamb meat was good
chicken was good and thanks for the naan that cooked fresh
i'm not a huge_fan_of indian food
but this place was pretty good
lunch buffet was only
great price for indian food and they had an array of different dishes
i really liked the sweet_rice
i've never had that before at an indian restaurant
great place if you like indian food
the bf and i came in and we were sat_down immediately with some ice water and papadams with chutney as we browsed the menu
we decided to get the
mt_everest special
which comes with
mixed appetizer
salad
papadam
chicken_tikka
dal_makhani
palak_paneer
lamb_curry
chicken_tikka
rice
naan
raita
for dessert gulab_jamun and chai_tea
we did not really get what was on the menu as we didn't get salad or our dessert but kheer rice_pudding instead
i didn't realize this until looking at the online menu for this review
either way it's alot of food but would have been nice to get what we ordered
the mix appetizer was some grilled sausage
chicken_tikka pieces
a samosa and little papadam bites
it was a very big plate and was super filling
the main_dishes were decent with the paneer being my favorite
my one thing was that the paneer and the dal needed a bit of salt
but still good
raita was more tangy and watery than most i've had
but was good to dip my naan in
the kheer was very nice and not too sweet
chicken_korma
entrees come with rice
it was decent
but was more yellow curry flavor than other kormas i've had
we also got some garlic_naan
thinking that there might not be enough naan with the mixed plate but if we didn't order this the plain_naan would be more than enough
the amount of food for two people with that is crazy
we had leftovers which i had for two separate and still very sizable lunches
we would have been very full and satisfied with just the mixed plate
but we had a restaurant
com certificate to use
service was okay
they started off good with drink refills when they came to drop off food
after a while they were doing tasks and seemed to be really into it towards of our meal so we sat there for a while needing things
overall
the food here isn't my favorite indian but decent
it definitely is the most value large portions than any others i've been to
i was surprised
driven by this place countless number of times but never ventured in seeing as it used to be a burger_king back in the day
the food was tasty
tried them out via a groupon now
the cashier didn't know anything about the groupon which was a little bit of a turn off cause i felt guilty trying to use it but they honored it anway for takeout service
had the chicken briyani and the chicken jalfrezi
i think the briyani could have used for chicken but it wasn't bad
the jalfrezi was not bad either
i love spicy and i miss the one restaurant in los angeles
closed recently
that used to make the best chicken_vindaloo
while in vegas i discovered_this_place and i'm so looking_forward to my next visit
awesome food
super delicious
wish they moved to los angeles
op
i took my family here to eat for an dinner at
pm
since we purchased a restaurant
com certificate
it may have the old structure of the burger_king
but it's a nice and relaxing atmosphere where they don't rush you
i was impressed with their tandoori oven chicken
it was very good portion
i've ate at some other places like san_francisco where they don't give you too much meat on the chicken
but this place in vegas is really good
to tell if an indian restaurant is any good is if they can't make the most common
typical naan and chicken_tikki_masala taste good that indian_restaurants are famous for
then i advise you run away and head for the hills
but seriously
their onion naan was good and tasty
everything we ordered was good and we will_definitely_go_back
i was looking for indian take out so i went to yelp
this place is out of my way
but i thought i would check it out
i am glad that i did
i called ahead and ordered take out
minutes_later when i arrived it was not ready
it took almost more minutes
ok
now i know
so that is fine
i ordered the lamb_korma and garlic_naan
woah
portions are for sharing
i saved some for the next day and it was even better
the large chunks of lamb
which i had to cut in half
were tender and tasty
the sauce made me realize how much i missed indian food
the jasmine rice was perfectly done
the garlic_naan delicious
i saw there is a lunch buffet and plenty of seating
maybe another day i will do the lunch buffet
thanks to everyone who yelped on this spot
i found a new indian take out spot
after misti y
suggested mt
everest to me
i had to stop by to try out their
lunch buffet
i had such a pleasant experience here
i dined solo and arrived around
pm
buffet ends at pm
the food was still hot delicious
the rice was still soft
and it wasn't too loud or too busy
the server and the manager were so incredibly polite
they periodically checked on me to make sure everything was to my liking and my water cup was always filled to the brim
the food was awesome
a variety of lamb and chicken curry
a few vegetarian_options
the samosas were on the salty side but still incredibly delicious
they had plain rice and a bright orange sweet_rice which was awesome but i preferred to eat the plain rice with all the sauces and meats
the naan was fluffy and as delicious can be
i managed to scarf down a whole basked by myself
next time i'll be asking to try the garlic_naan too
i saw a table next to me order it and it looked awesome
the food speaks for itself but the service is what will keep me coming_back
two thumbs_up
i ws in vegas for the weekend
and was craving_indian_food
so we decided to go here based_on yelp suggestions
we went for lunch and had the buffet the food was nice
decent
nothing extraordinary but not bad at all
overall decent place
the service is good
another lunch favorite
i've been several times for lunch
and always eat at the buffet
the food is delicious
there's various traditional options
including basmati_rice
samosas
chicken dishes
e
g
chicken_tikka
dal_makhani
and other vegetarian_dishes
there's also fruit
the buffet actually has a good variety of food
my absolute favorite is the sweet_rice
which is orange colored and has peanuts
or cashews
in it
i have a sweet tooth and love rice
so this is the best of both worlds for me
i'm not a huge meat_eater
but am not vegetarian either so i end up loading up on the sweet_rice
my runner up favorite
or actually maybe tied
is the naan
whoa nelly
the naan is always warm and soft
we always get a basket that has plain_naan and naan with garlic
the garlic_naan is super good
although i'm sure it's a huge faux pas
i love getting the orange marmalade from the buffet
for the fruit
and putting just a little on the naan
that's my dirty little secret at mt
everest
overall
it's a great place to have lunch
it's generally busy or at least half way full
i think it also feels a little nicer because the tables in the center of the restaurant have linen table cloths
oh
and another plus they usually have a bollywood movie playing on a flat screen tv above the buffet
the sound is not on or is low
but it's fun to watch nevertheless
tried their_lunch_buffet and it was good for most part
they had a big selection of veg and meat dishes and also a south_indian sambar and idli option
the place was very busy and it took about min
after we had served ourselves to get a naan
the good items on the menu were
kheer
rice_pudding
amazing
samosa nicely seasoned and not greasy at all
butter_chicken very good
roghan josh
lamb
very good
the not so good
dal_makhani dal was not cooked completely and was tooooo salty
kadhi it was made very well but toooooo salty again
pakora dry and hard
white rice dried_out
since they were busy
it was very difficult for us to get the attention of the server
who was the only one doubling as the cashier as well
we gave up and didn't get a second naan
it also took forever to get the bill so we finally walked up and paid at the register
it may be a good idea to get more help on the weekends
we had lunch today at mt_everest india's_cuisine with an out of town guest
we have been there before
but we feel this is the very best indian restaurant in the
las_vegas area and beyond
all the food on the buffet was outstanding
we especially love the spinach and lamb and chicken curry
we had some
special indian hot tea for our digestion after the meal
the two kinds of naan
was awesome
the owner is extremely pleasant and made_us_feel welcome
our guest was impressed with the variety of food on the buffet and remarked
that everything she tried was delicious
the service was outstanding and the value of the meal was incredible
i can't
say enough good things about this restaurant and recommend it very highly
was a very good experience
the owner literally ran to the kitchen when i ran out of water and was very attentive to us
i had lamb_curry and it was very good
although i ordered it a little too spicy
will definitely go again
this has become our regular indian place to eat
great food
great prices and friendly service
the food can tend to come out a little spicy
so if you normally order say a at other restaurants
it's safer to go with a
we eat here every couple_of_weeks and always bring friends and family
mt
everest is a great find and we were really impressed with the caring service from prakass and food
we had chicken_tikka_masala
fabulous
we were eating the sauce by itself when the chicken was gone
rogan_josh
lamb
was tender and no fat
the naan_bread was fluffy and crispy
i'm not a beer drinker but our server prakass suggested that we try the indian beer
taj_mahal
loved it
the food portions are generous as well
will_definitely_return
lamb sagg is a must get
great food
local celebrity yuhi k
recommended mt
everest to me and oh boy was she right
oh yes
i'm a brit
we know
or think we know
everything about indian food
we grow up eating the stuff
there are more indian_restaurants in england than mickey d's
really
would i embellish
maybe but i don't think so in this instance
anyway
friday_night and the kids ditched us
outrageous i know
but gives wifee and i a rare chance to eat what we want
yuhi k
recommends a place down on sahara
i explain
who is yuhi k
asks my leader
she knows about food
i explain unconvincingly
it is a long drive down w
sahara from my hood and wifee is viewing my choice with suspicion
it will be great
i proclaim
be patient
mt
everest sits in front of a slightly rundown strip_mall but parking is easy and my expedition was a success
we were greeted promptly and offered a table or booth
booth
the greeter server guy seemed to be the owner
he was great
recommended a great beer
taj_mahal
pints of frothy cold delight
wifee grabbed a nice cold chardonnay
we started with a mixed dish of samosa
kebab
chicken_tikka and some other stuff
fantastic and more than enough to share
mains
i had a mushroom lamb dish
i am asked how spicy i would like
being a big shot expert indian food eater
i asked for
too hot
i'm such a wimp after many years away from blighty
really quite pathetic
i tell my server owner guy
no problem
he took it away and brought it back re done at a more acceptable spiceness
i'm pretty sure that's not a word
sorry
delicious
served with rice and a garlic_naan
wifee has chicken saag
she ordered on the heat scale
perfect
water was always topped up
drinks were offered frequently
really great and we are going back
often
thanks yuhi k
by far
my favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
i originally found out about them through groupon
i stopped by while in the area for take out
my go to dish is often chicken_makhani
heat
but the second time i decided to opt for a dish that wasn't so heavy and the waiter recommended the lamb_curry
the lamb was cooked_to_perfection
lamb that is not cooked correctly is tough and gamey
the portions are generous and the price is more than reasonable
i will continue to go out of my way for mt
everest
yet again a great meal here
we eat here a couple_of_times a month and the food remains fabulous
it's nice to see the place getting busier as well
have eaten the lunch buffet here at least times over the course of years
and i must say that mt
everest is finally in it's prime
i immediately sensed a new chef visits ago
and my guess was confirmed by the owner
the owner was visibly excited about the new chef's contributions
smiling and describing all of the new dishes
tastewise and lookswise
the buffet has never been better
it costs more than before
but it is worth it
the sambar soup is perfectly seasoned
the new dishes
chicken chili
vegetable_korma
are colorful and tasty
and the overall spice_level is kicked up one notch closer to a straight up medium
the chicken mahkani is masterful and complex as good as some of the best chicken_tikka_masala type curry i've tasted
the dal mahkani is a or bean variety and is much improved over the previous chef's version
great samosas and aloo vegetable varieties
very importantly
the buffet console is boiling hot so all of the food is steaming hot and remains hot on your plate several minutes after you sit_down at your table
this is a huge detail that can make or break an indian buffet
mt
everest nails it keep it up
business seems better than ever
which is a good sign that i'm not the only one who feels like this food has gotten really good
typical to an indian lunch buffet
the fresh baked naan and roti are complimentary
but the whole_wheat roti is especially good here one would expect it to come out traditionally thin and flat
but the mt
everest version can be mistaken for a puffy naan_bread a nice surprise
whole_wheat roti has taken the place of white basmati_rice in my indian lunch diet
buffet plates and bowls are clean and shiny
water glasses are refilled constantly
every_single visit
finished plates are picked_up quickly
overall service is great
my only warning is you may smell like indian food for the rest of the afternoon
so if you are on your way to an important meeting in a small office space
maybe bring a change of clothing if you are self conscious about that kind of thing
i guess this is proof that when you eat the lunch buffet at mt
everest
you are immersed in a cauldron of indian deliciousness
go now and get it while it's hot
i've waited this long to write a review because if i really care about a place i want to make sure it's right before friends go try it for the first time
see my cravin' cajun review
the very best indian lunch buffet in town
i literally enjoy every hot dish they offer and i'm glad they're still doing brisk business
stand outs for me include the korma
saag_paneer
chicken tandoori and the chana_masala
how do people operate after stuffing their faces here for lunch
i only go on my days off since i'm in a coma for at least a couple of hours after
went there for a lunch buffet and was greeted_by a very nice gentleman
for the buffet they had a few chicken dishes as well as lentils
samosas
saag_paneer sweet_rice and regular basmati_rice
chicken was spicy and flavorful but nothing too crazy since it was covered in chili peppers
the chicken tandori was good but a little on the dry side
the chicken makahni was very flavorful and wasn't too creamy
their masala chai was very good and nan_bread was excellent
i was a little disappointed in the saag panner because there was a lack of paneer i had scoops of it and only managed to get small pieces
but good thing they didn't overload it with heavy cream though
for dessert they had watermelon
oranges and rice_pudding
i had the rice_pudding and it was on the thick side
aside from the lack of panner and tandori_chicken this place is good and i will_be_going_back
i'm a simple man
you serve butter_chicken on your menu and it doesn't suck
instant fan
actually
their murgh makhani is as good as anywhere i've ever had it
i ate the whole thing
not sure what else i need to say on the matter
my wife and i went last_night
this now is
by far
our favorite indian_joint
amazing
i was wary of indian buffet style but this was a good choice
good service
good variety
tandoori_chicken
the paneer
and masala were good enought that i'll be going back
the food here is delicious
flavorful and colorful
this nice indian buffet on the corner of valley view and sahara costs
and it's worth it
the restaurant has a nice elegant setting as well
super yummy foods and a great buffet selection for veg heads like me
the mango_lassi was one of the best i've had in a while
nice friendly service and good food makes me a fan
the staff here is very nice
i came to expect much less from indian pakistani restaurants
they understand the meaning of hospitality and the food is outstanding
try the chicken or fish tikka_marsala with garlic_naan
snagged an online deal for this place after i heard about it from friends
it was really great
the portions were generous
the prices were reasonable and the staff was very kind
they don't have a full bar here though
so plan accordingly
a few friends and i visited mt
everest india's_cuisine and we all agreed that we enjoyed this place a lot
the service was very good we felt neither rushed nor neglected
the owner is good at guiding hesitant diners to the type of dish he feels each would appreciate
we had a lot of fun sharing different dishes all were delicious
definitely a place to return to
delicious lunch buffet for bucks
good variety and fresh food
i will return
excellent
i knew i was in the right place when i saw paneer pakoras on the menu
mango lassies smooth as silk
its hard for me to rate any indian restaurant at stars because no one will ever compare to some homecooked meals by my mom
but that being said this food was rather tasty
they used an appropriate blend_of_spices that weren't overpoweringly spicy
for an indian person i don't do as well with spicy food as one might expect
this was a great balance of flavor amidst the kick in my mouth
i did ask for mild
i came here for dinner and not going to lie was a little turned off by the outside
very seedy looking place
then i stepped inside and saw that it was decorated in a comfortable manner
clean and efficient enough
at least for appearence's sake
they brought out some papadum and a couple sauces to go with it
i ordered the shahi_paneer which was good
not the best i've ever had but again i'm partial to homecookin
one little complaint i had was that i needed to ask for water a couple times as i tend to drink a lot of it while eating
this is usually a given at higher end places
but as there was only two people working and it was rather busy i'll give them benefit of the doubt
also when i asked the waiter if i should try the shahi_paneer or the paneer_tikka_masala he said he didn't know because he didn't eat vegetarian food
in a slightly rude manner
overall worth_the_trip and they provide a solid indian food experience
this restaurant is really wonderful
went on a friday_evening
and was greeted_by a friendly host right away
appetizers and main_course arrived quickly
the food was absolutely divine
the flavors were rich and full
spicy
but not too spicy
the kind of food that you want to keep eating even when you are full
the staff were all very friendly_and_attentive
my family will definitely be going to this restaurant again
it was a fluke that my friend and i passed by mt
everest in search of a quick lunch after visiting the salon
we passed by chinatown because she could not eat anything in that vicinity
running short on time we were not able to get to our original destination
while on sahara we passed by this place and good thing because my heart was set on indian
seeing that most of my friends has written so highly of this place
it was worth giving a try
for
the lunch buffet is one amazing deal
i wasted no time
got a plate and created a mountain that would give everest a run for its money
saag_paneer will always be my favorite
i spooned some onto my plate and was elated with the large cubes of cheese swimming in my spinach
the sweet_rice can be eaten on its own as a dessert like the similarly florescent orange rice found in vietnamese eateries or used to balance out the spice in your favorite curry
i ate it with my meal and it contributed a nice contrast to everything else on my plate
the aloo_gobi was seasoned well
but did not have much cauliflower
the goat_curry was tender and did not possess the gaminess that people normally complain_about
the stew did contain many small bone
i spent some time picking through to be safe
the tandoori was dry on the outside and moist on the inside
i have never seen that before
so it was not a total bust
if there was an aspect to complain_about
it was that i was not at the table to order garlic_naan
plain_naan just doesn't do anything for me anymore
the gulab juman are delicious
but more than two of these fried milk balls and i am sure to become diabetic
the buffet is good
but placing a regular order is the way to go
the korma and tikka curries are both great
lousy part_of_town
but the food is very tasty
prices are good
especially when compared to orange county
ca
my favorite indian place in vegas for sure
everything is spiced right
portions are good and filling
its one of those places you can be adventurous in ordering and you wont go wrong
stars because i cannot validate the care
and freshness of everything as they have a lunch buffet
and buffet's for the most part are suspect
you could do a lot worse
plus my friend tried it who is not an indian food fan
and he did not get sick
and ate almost all of it
small victories
four stars for meeting my expectations based_on other yelpers
we were not extremely hungry
i ordered the chicken tandoori tiki
hope i got that right
as i don't have my handy dandy asian indian food guide close by
and my wife
ordered the okra
which comes with basmati_rice
we also ordered garlic_nan
and for a specialty beverage
the mango_lassi
a mango yogurt drink
i'll say up front
everything was very good
and the mango drink was very much like what we drink
brasilian style
mixing papaya
mango or passion fruit
with various forms of yogurt
ice_cream
or condensed milk
i bet i've passed this place twenty five times over the past few years when in vegas on business
the building is old looking
near the bus stop at the front of an older strip center
and in an older section of west vegas
but once you walk inside
see a relatively nice interior
and see the many regulars we saw
you're probably going to have the same high level of confidence we had
while service is stereotypical etchnic restaurant slow and spotty
the food does deliver
it will never be as good as homemade
if you cook indian at home
but then
as a brasilian family
we rarely find stateside restaurants that meet our standards
that's to be expected
but having enjoyed indian_cuisine over the years
i'm comfortable recommending this restaurant
i've added mt
everest to my
black book
of off strip restaurants
if it's good enough for the many indian clients i saw there tonight
then i'm sure it'll be good enough for you
remember that indian clients could go anywhere in town
but there was a good number of couples and foursomes dining in tonight
this alone told us it must have passed their test for authentic and good enough food preparation quality to compete with their own home_cooked meals
so as they say in vegas
i'm in
at least for this indian restaurant
i love indian food and this place delivered
i ordered the standard fare for me at an indian place
tandoori chicken_tika
chicken masala
and a mixed_grill dish
all were very good
i was with my parents and could not ramp up the spice so it was pretty cool but i didn't order it spicy
so i am curious to hit this place and tell them max spice and see how it is
each dish was good i thought it was kind of odd that i only got one rice with what appears to me to be entrees
i requested a second rice and got charged
i dunno
thought it could be included
i also ordered these deep_fried chiles to start
they were good but really unpredictable
one chiles was melt your face off the next had nothing so it was an interesting experience not sure what would happen next
i would go again for sure
everything was done well and the food was good
hopefully with some spice it will be great
oh_yeah
had a groupon there too which was nice
yummy buffet
reasonable_price
love their chai
try their buffet
their desserts was awesome too
service was awesome
outstanding service
prakash is awesome
food is delicious
i traveled all the way from green valley
henderson to have the sumptuous buffet
great food
great people
i love indian food and am able to cook most indian dishes being an indian from singapore
occasionally
we will eat out and my first choice is mount_everest india's_cuisine
why
the service rendered by prakash is worth mentioning and he caters to our every needs
thank you prakash for excellent service and delicious food
love the tea too
first foremost
this is one of our favorite indian buffet restaurant
scrumptious spread of fine_dining
loving every bit of it
not forgetting their masala chai desserts
we were served with tender
loving care by prakash
thanks once again for attending to us today as always
we appreciate it
the mt
everest is the best of both veggie and meat worlds
my wife is a vegetarian and i am on the atkins diet
i love the huge selection of meals and prakash
the owner
is the nicest man
the restaurant is spotless
table cloths
with endless attention to detail
i wish i had known about this place years_ago
try the buffet lunch for welcome surprises
they change the food selection every day
we tried the lunch buffet
it was wonderful
food was very fresh
service_was_prompt
the only reason i am giving stars instead of is i wish the items were listed in english as well or maybe just a description
i went with my husband who is not the biggest fan_of_indian_food and i know what i like but i can't really explain exactly what is in each dish
took my punjabi friend there for the buffet lunch and we really enjoyed it
will be back again again
cruising in my lotus elise rental
i wanted to get some good eats a nice drive off the strip
indian food popped up and i dialed in this place
the inside was a bit darker cooler than i thought
with just the buffet lamps giving light besides the natural light
still pretty nice
the food was great and the waiter owner
was nice
when i asked them about not having rice kheer dessert
they said it rotates with other different items
that day had a mango dessert
darn
to my surprise
he brings out a complimentary bowl of kheer
awesome
it is one of my favorite desserts
so simple
yet so good
the naan is nice and fluffy
too
i am a regular here
best value for an indian lunch buffet
the naan never disappoints
try the garlic_naan most of the food is somewhat spicy as it should be
the owner doubles as a waiter and even with tables and booths the service is still excellent and he also works the register
my fave indian_joint in vegas
best lunch buffet ever
the food is always on point great selection and amazing service
the owner is always in the dinning room ensuring everyone is enjoying their meal
this place is fantastic
everyone must try
mmmmmmmmmmm
if you can look past the fact that this place is obviously a former burger_king
this is a great lunch buffet
jam packed on a weekday
the only thing we had that we weren't crazy about were the samosas
they were small and not very flavorful
otherwise
pretty solid
we went for the lunch buffet
which was absolutely_amazing
the service was great and the food was unforgettable
i highly_recommend this place
the location is easily accessible too
just got finished_eating at mount_everest for their_lunch_buffet and i'm literally reeling in pain at my desk
this opening line would work much better if you couldn't already see the star_rating i'm giving them
yes
this is that sushi mon all_you_can_eat and then some
pants button undoing type of stomach pain
and not the having flashbacks of the subway employee not washing his hands while making your sweet onion teriyaki chicken sandwich type of pain
i wish i could describe what i ate in detail
but the truth is i have no idea
on the first plate i tried everything on the right side of the hot buffet items
which resulted in a plate of rice and an assortment of deliciously spiced veggie and chicken dishes along with some veggie_samosas and pakoras
after a while
sauces were blending into each other
pakora were getting smothered with various other items
left became right
black became white
and soon a harmonious melting pot had been achieved on my plate that rivaled any buffet experience i've had
with each bite i had no idea which item
s
i were eating
but they were all fantastic
some of these bites provided quite a kick and the quickly refilled iced_tea and water were much appreciated
i had no need for a nd plate
i had no room for a nd plate
someone should have stopped me
but alas
they didn't
walking up to the buffet line
the only game plan i had was to try everything on the left side that i didn't try the first time
chicken curry
chicken something else
chicken something else
done
unfortunately i also couldnt resist some more daal
some more samosas
some more pakora
bites in i knew i was in trouble
bites in i started to hurt
bites in i tapped out
now an_hour later i'm finally starting to recover
you may have won the battle mount_everest
but i will be back to win the war
first of all
please don't go by their advertisement
vegas's biggest indian buffet
it is not
food was alright
not good selection of appetizers
place is ok
best_indian_food_in_vegas
highly_recommend
fantastic food and service
te best_indian_food_in_las_vegas by far
i come at_least_once_a_week for the buffet lunch and i can honestly say i've never had a bad meal here
the food is always fresh
hot and ready to go for you as soon as you walk in and the bread is always made to order and at your table as quick as can be
i've been in las_vegas for four months and don't go any where else
the staff sets everything apart
they always welcome myself and friends in with a smile and fast service
you can get good food in other places but for great food and great service you have to come here
we went here in our may trip
we are generally pretty picky about indian food as we have eaten in india and almost all across america in many indian_restaurants
we were craving for some indian food in vegas and decided to try here
from the outside
it didn't look that inviting
but once
we were in
the service was awesome
every food we ordered was authentic and to our taste
tandoori_chicken is one dish that i am usually never satisfied in most indian_restaurants in the states
but the tandoori_chicken here just rocked
it was juicy
scrumptious and perfectly_cooked
just like the clay_oven cooked chicken in india
we love it
the host was generous in proportions and very friendly
its a little gem in vegas
best_indian_food_in_vegas
we always go here and this food is delicious and authentic
ok we went back again since my company wanted to go and i think the lack of service from my prior experience was because the owner was stressed out
service was good again and food was actually much better and flavorful when you order it fresh
food with flavors
just wonderfull
they never let my_water_glass get lower than half
the best
would you care to feed a small army
does your army enjoy delicious indian spiced foods
then bring them down to mount_everest
i don't know why
but my husband and i always order our
staples
when we go to an indian restaurant and we can be pretty particular about them
things were no different here
our staples are
saag_paneer
called palak_paneer here
vegetable_korma
mango_lassi
and garlic_naan
because we had a restaurant
com_coupon
we were also able to order paneer tiki_masala and vegetable_samosas
normally at other indian_restaurants this would be a ton of food for us which
sadly
we can finish if we are hungry enough
but we are giant pigs
mount_everest takes the cake for largest serving sizes in the valley
we had two boxes of leftovers
you are definitely getting your money's worth here
not only are the portions huge
but this is some of the best indian food i've had
they have given my beloved mint a run for their money
the paneer tiki_masala had great flavor and lots of paneer
plus the paneer was fantastic it was denser than most paneer and had a very mild flavor
i could be wrong
but it seemed like it was made fresh
the vegetable_korma was mildly spiced
in a good way
and was loaded with a large variety of fresh vegetables
the saag_paneer was a little different than what i'm used to
but i still enjoyed it
it was a little milder
had a lot of cream
and the spinach was well blended
all these dishes we ordered medium
but they were pretty mild on the spice
i think we could have could have ordered spicier and been ok
the free papadums were good and i enjoyed the mint and tamarind sauces
the mango_lassi
while having a very interesting intense orange color i'm not used to
was very good as well
the vegetable_samosas were gigantic but a little bit on the greasy side
the garlic_naan had every inch covered in garlic
hooray
but seemed a little uncooked in the middle
the service was very friendly but a little slow at times
especially when the place began to fill up
the building may be a little iffy on the outside
what is that
an old pizza hut
it was very nice on the inside and very clean
plus they play bollywood movies
oh
and did i mention that they gave_us an extra giant order of rice for all our leftovers
for free
overall
this is a great place to enjoy some delicious indian food
just be prepared to take some home
absolutely_delicious
best food in vegas
everything we had was delicious
there were six people on our group and all of us were very happy with the food and service
every dish was perfect
we came here for lunch buffet when i was majorly craving_indian_food and my husband insisted we finally try something other than our usual place
mint
the food was honestly good
and spicier than mint
which was a welcome change of pace
but the surroundings are kinda bleh and we didn't get refills on our naan and we had to wait forever in between pop refills
the service was pretty iffy
the buffet selection is decent and i liked that they had samosas on the buffet
the food was good and i wouldn't object to going back but there are other places that i think offer a better all around experience
being indian and all
i can cook indian food fairly well
but i seek out indian restaurant for the beautiful diversity of regional specialties that i just don't know how to cook or do not have the equipment to cook
eg
tandoor oven
in the years
that i lived here i have yet to find an indian restaurant that blows me away
but mt
everest is one of the
better
ones
came here on a saturday_night around
pm
not the best looking place from the outside
but still hopeful this was a diamond in the rough
the parking_lot was full however
surprisingly there were only two other tables filled
however
towards the end of our meal the restaurant filled out
my husband and i got there before the other couple joining us
it is one of their favorite restaurants
the staff immediately greeted and seated us
we had a few moments to look around
decor is a bit dated with the dark green upholstery
but well kept
we ordered a bottle_of_wine from the limited but reasonably_priced popular wines
once the other couple arrived
they were immediately recognized as familiar faces by the staff
prior to ordering we were served complimentary papadoms with the tradition mint and tamarind chutneys
we ordered tandoori_chicken as an appetizer
this is a great value given there were atleast pieces
it came out sizzling hot
serve on a cast iron skillet
i wanted to love it as its sight and sound captured my senses
but it was missing that aromatic smell
that is right
it was not aromatic or flavorful
kind of bland for tandoori
but nothing offensive and definitely well prepared
still worth getting
because it comes out fresh and sizzling
just spritz with lemon and sprinkle salt it is more than fine
shortly_after our main_dishes came out palak_paneer
chicken_tikka
rogan_josh
garlic_naan
and a side kachumber salad
first off
the portions were plentiful
and more than enough to feed four hearty adult appetites and two for lunch_the_next_day
the palak to the palak_paneer makes that dish silky
creamy and very comforting
but could use a bit more spice although it was ordered at a level on spice scale
to
the chicken_tikka was tasty and familiar in the sweet
tomatoey style
i prefer it slightly less sweet
but again
well made and worth trying
the rogan josh's flavor was complexly layers and my_favorite_dish
it almost like my moms
however
we ordered it at a level spiciness
but it was much milder than expected
although i don't eat bread
according to my fellow dinners the garlic_naan was fresh
warm and soft
the kachumber salad was standard
throughout our meal
the manager owner
kept checking to make sure we were satisfied and of course
asking if we wanted more wine once we finished the bottle we order
he gave_us generously filled glasses for
and we had a friendly conversation
overall
the food was prepared with quality_ingredients and with care
but lacked a bit of seasoning
i haven't returned to many indian_restaurants in vegas
but i am sure to return to mt
everest because the food is good
well priced
and the manager and staff is friendly
a special combination lacking in most indian_restaurants
stars
outstanding food
incredibly friendly service
slightly understaffed
but we are patient dinners
for the price the quality and portion_size was wonderful
if the food was not so affordable
then i would have been turned off by the atmosphere
it's certainly is not classy
but doesn't offer any warm old divey feelings to placate my heart either
i would come here again and again
i kept hearing
that was the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
from fellow patrons
and for the price i would agree
you literally have to pay twice as much to come close to beating mount_everest
always a great experience
food is amazing with a excellent variety of spices
excellent place for indian buffet
i stayed in las_vegas for days and i tried couple of indian restaurant but this stands_out because of the quality and variety of food available
a
best indian buffet i've had
ever
used a groupon deal here
wasn't sure it was good for the thali
which if you go to an indian restaraunt is your best deal
you get a bit of everything
like previous reviewers
this place is owned by nepalese
when you drive up it looks almost like it is dark
not open from the outside
but i think thats because of the glare stuff they have on the windows for the heat during the day time
the service was great
we ordered a vegetarian thali and i ordered the mt
everest thali
which came with lamb
tandoori_chicken and butter_chicken
along with the vegeterian options
normally at other indian_restaurants i never get appetizers with the thali
this came with the usual paperdums
which had both mint_chutney and tamarind_chutney
which was made fresh you could tell
in addition to that we got pakoras
fried califlower
and appetizers size chicken pieces and lamb
ours came with dessert
rice_pudding and gulab jamman
the best we have had thus far
the gulab was nice and firm and the syrup was thick not watery like i normally have experienced
we also ordered chai
it came in a big oz cup
like a take way
and was made fresh because it was pipping hot
my boyfriend wanted to go back the next day just for the tea
highly highly_recommend this
especiallyif you know your indian food
much better than tamba on the strip
per very positive yelp_reviews
a couple of friends and i stopped in here one evening
and very glad_we_did
food was amazing service was excellent
we ordered saag_paneer
chicken_tikka_masala and garlic_naan all phenomenal
and i eat quite a bit of indian food
our server
which i believe was also the owner
was incredibly nice and sincerely thankful for our business
such great service seems hard to come by these days
so this place really made an impression on me
i'd recommend it to any one in town craving something other than hangover pizza
excited for leftovers tomorrow
got here at exactly
we were seated and given papadam right away
the staff were friendly
food was delicious
the chai_tea was excellent
the best i've had
it was just a little bit of a wait but i didn't care since i had all night
lol
i shared the appetizer with my bf
it really filled me up
i was done after that
great price
must try mt_everest thali specials for
trust_me its a lot of food
didn't i mention
awesome customer_service
for sho'
my boyfriend and i tried this because of a groupon now offer
and we weren't disappointed
we ordered a chicken appetizer
the paalak paneer and a lamb dish we had not heard of before
along with some garlic_naan
the order was more than we could finish
even though we enjoyed every bite
particularly
the lamb was so tender and succulent
the atmosphere was comfortable and the owner came to greet us
we would_definitely_go_back again
a surprisingly awesome buffet in a place i would have never guessed
a bit of a shady corner next to a gas station
easily the best indian_buffet_in_town
this place offers a small but very tasty buffet
about items or so
accompanied_by some delicious naan
the owner is very cordial and welcoming and will make sure your table is well taken_care_of
a lunch buffet with a mango_lassi
very tasty
btw
will run about and will be worth_every_penny
they also have a la_carte items
which i have never tried
but i bet they are just a tasty as the buffet items
i've never had indian food before so i don't have much to compare this place to
you definitely have to be somewhat adventurous with the different strong smells and exotic looking food haha
i would say that i enjoyed the food but the poor service i received is why i am giving them stars
when we walked into the restaurant we weren't really greeted and the girl just pointed at a table for us to sit at
we went and filled our plates with a little bit of everything
no one came to take our drink_orders so i had flag someone down for some water
then a guy dropped off some naan and i said
oh
but we wanted to try the garlic_naan
can we get some please
and the man just rudely said we had finish this order first
we kept having to flag someone down to refill our drinks
ugh
i will say though that i loved the hot fresh garlic_naan and the delicious chicken curry
so much so that i find myself craving it
hopefully next time the service will be better
i'm normally not a fan_of_indian_food
but this place is am az ing
we ordered a ton of food and gobbled it down like vagabonds who had been starving in the desert for centuries
i highly_recommend the chicken_tikka masalla and okra dishes
ps
you definitely can't judge this book by its cover
my parents in law
husband and i were looking for some really good indian food on our thanksgiving trip to las_vegas
my in laws had been to this restaurant before but this was the first time for my husband and i
we were not disappointed
the food was very tasty
but not oily at all
the buffet selection was wonderful
lots of chicken and non vegetarian choices along with vegetables and dessert and salad
the service was excellent and the atmosphere was perfect
my father in law does not eat naan and the restaurant offered to make him roti's instead at no charge
they are so kind
the best part
at
per_person for lunch
this is the best deal you can get
i wish they had a location where i live in california
i plan on visiting this restaurant everytime i come to las_vegas
please visit this place next time you are in las_vegas
i have nothing bad to say at all
excellent indian food
don't be scared by the looks of the building
i run a software company with employees in bangalore and travel there a couple_of_times a year
so while i wouldn't call myself any kind of expert
i do know when the palak spices aren't fresh or the nan was left sitting
neither of those things happened at mount_everest
definitely recommended
this is our go to place when we're craving an indian lunch buffet
favorite items include their murgh makhani
butter_chicken
and saag
in fact
their saag is so incredibly tasty that we suspect it is prepared with msg
the wifey gets very sleepy after consuming msg so we generally avoid it
but yet we keep_coming_back for more
although the ambiance needs refreshing and their naan is too doughy for our taste
overall this is the best tasting place in town
stars for the food
stars for the service
pleasant size
and great price
for a small buffet it had great variety
i particularly liked the goat_curry and sweet_rice
what really made my visit great was the owner
he was constantly attending to all the tables
providing refills on water and asking his guests how their meals tasted
attentive and kind
while providing great food
earns stars in my book
this is by far my favorite place for indian food and i've been to many places all over the city
the food here is comforting
full of delicious spices
and nicely priced
the entrees come with delectable basmati_rice
which you usually have to order separately at other places
and the naan the fluffiest
softest pieces of heaven
the buffet has a good selection of tasty things
and its always different so you get to try everything
the owner is so personable and nice
we come here at least once a month
if not more often
and will continue to do so
love_this_place
fantastic lunch buffet and friendly_staff
the saag_paneer is the best
love the service and food
this place really has a family_run establishment atmosphere
perfect naan and paneer tiki_masala
hands_down
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
the naan comes out hot
the saag_paneer is amazing
masala sauce is the best i've ever had
the owner is a very nice guy who isn't afraid to roll up his sleeves and wait tables
try the lunch buffet for a wonderful variety_of_dishes
the only problem i've ever had here is eating too much
the food is delicious and the service is excellent
i've had their buffet a couple times
and it never disappoints there are the typical things that i know and love
but there are always other dishes to try that are always yummy
when we come for dinner
i usually get chicken_makhani at a spicy level positively to die for
i know there are other places_in_town
but if you want the best indian food
look no further than mt
everest
i love_this_place
i've eaten here many times and they've never disappointed
the food is delicious i almost always get the chicken_tikka_masala
but the chicken tandoori is to die for
spicy without being too much
and the naan
i've had garlic and regular
is fabulous
really
all the food i've had here has been excellent
i also love their_lunch_buffet
it's a good deal at
and there is always great variety
i've been able to try many things that i would have never ordered
goat_curry yum
but there are also always some of my favorites
their dinner menu is reasonably_priced
especially with a groupon
but the lunch buffet is definitely the deal to get if you're in the area at lunch time
the first time i went the location was a little scary it's on the corner next to a gas station and mariana's supermarket and the outside is not super bright
i was a little nervous
but as soon as i stepped inside i felt much better
it is a cute place tablecloths on the tables
well lit
not bright but definitely not
shady
and the people are so nice
i've always had excellent service definitely the nicest servers i've had in a long time
i definitely highly_recommend mt
everest
roti's were softest ever and buffet items were decent
i am giving one star because of the rudeness i received
we wanted to order from menu and we were told there is a minimum per head including kids for ordering
this is after the waiter asked us if we wanted to order
owner manager came and told us that there is such a minimum and thats why they provided buffet
kind of telling us we cant afford per head luxury of ordering from menu
so if you are desperate for food
go here
food was no good
there were lots of indian customers inside
is it a sign of good indian food
for our taste
not good at all
couldn't even find a spicy dish
find another place in lv
wow
we went for dinner tonight at
shady looking building but the inside is cute and of course it smells amazing
the men working were so nice
we ordered a lot
the fried paneer
shrimp tikka masala
shrimp_vindaloo
garlic_naan
lamb naan
and mango_lassi
everything seriously was spectacular
indian food is my favorite and my boyfriend and i are very judgmental diners
i'm not sure i've had better indian food than this
the only suggestion i would make is to use larger shrimp
one of the guys even brought over a rose for me as we were leaving
thank you all for giving us such a great experience
we come here every time we're in las_vegas
which is times a year
major trade shows
and weekends away
and the owner
prakash always recognizes us
which is nice
the food is great
especially the vindaloo
which is my favorite
get the samosas
and some naan to round out your meal
bring your appetite
the portions are generous
and the prices very reasonable
well with the trip off the strip
first let me say i'm not a vegas guy
if i never came back here i'd be happy
and trying to get a decent affordable meal on or around the strip is a nightmare
if you're being wined and dined
then by all means
have the sales manager take you to whatever over priced bellagio restaurant you see fit
if
like me
a great meal in a quiet place is what you're after
run
dont walk
to mt
everest
prakash and the fellas serve up some of the tastiest indian_cuisine i've ever had
don't let the neighborhood
it's quite safe
or the former pizza hut exterior deter you
as soon as you walk inside it feels like an oasis
and the delicious smells of curry and tandoori greet you
the chicken_tikka
served sort of fajita style
was tender and delicious
and spiced to perfection
the saag_paneer
one of my favorite indian dishes
was savory and so inviting that i kept going back to it as i
filled in the corners
at the end of the meal
when i'd already eaten too much
we also had their lamb_curry which was not a ground lamb_curry but featured a generous portion of cubed lamb shoulder perfectly_cooked and tender
this is my new go to spot in this ridiculous town
mount_everest is fabulous
my husband and i went to have some dinner and we didn't realize the time
the restaurant was actually closed and the owner prakash welcomed us and gave_us the option to order take out
we really appreciated that
and we were worried that his staff would be upset with us for ruining their closing routine
prakash was so nice and he took our order and we even ordered extra sides after we had put the original order in
and he still accommodated us
he didn't even charge us for the extra sides
we will definitely come here again within hours when we are in town next time
the food was amazing spicy like we enjoy
we noticed this place as we were out driving around
we thought it was a drive through indian restaurant
which we thought was such a great idea that we had to check it out
to our disappointment
the drive through window isn't operational
going inside
i expected fast_food furnishings and decor to match the outside of the restaurant
no way
white tablecloths and cloth napkins
waiters attending to the patrons
and best of all
fragrant
delectable indian_cuisine at a
lunch buffet
the disappointment of the non working drive through window was completely forgotten once we experienced the excellent food
it was so good that we kept embarrassing ourselves
mmm
mmmma
oh my gosh this is so good
every dish was fresh
seasoned perfectly
not greasy
gamy or too salty
occasionally they even changed the food
putting out a completely different dish in place of something that was there before
the naan was amazing
i could go there just for the naan
they offered more
but we had to say
no thank you
because the rest of the food was so good
the vegetarian_dishes were at a separate warming table than the chicken dishes
this speaks volumes for how they care for their customers
and i'm sure the vegetarian customers appreciate this
the service was impeccable
our_water_glasses were kept full
even the water was good no chlorine taste
they didn't bring a check so we paid on the way out
but that might just be how they do it there
which is fine by us
we gave the highest tip percentage that we give due to the fine service and quality of food
we_will_definitely_be_back
this is now officially our place for indian food
we just went back again today
it was every bit as good this time
and they offered an accommodation for our disabled son without our asking for it
which was very kind
we'll_be_back again soon
some of the best indian food in the area
to be honest
it's not in the nicest neighborhood
but if it's mighty tasty food you crave
at a very reasonable_price
take the minute drive off the strip to enjoy delicious grub
don't be scared by the exterior
which rather needs some tlc
because the interior is actually quite nice and cozy
and well maintained
try the vindaloo
it's some of the best i've ever had anywhere
i wouldn't recommend the salad
it's not exactly as pictured
the naan
however
is fragrant and fluffy
the owner actually still recognizes us from when we visited one year_ago
either we're funny looking
or he's got a good memory
the best indian restaurant in las_vegas
don't waste your time
money or taste_buds any where besides mt
everest indian cusine
i have tried almost all of the indian_restaurants in las_vegas
tamba indian restaurant was the worst of all i would not eat there even for free
if you want real indian experience of indian cusine then definitely you should go and try this place out
best of all excellent customer_service from all of staff
guru
great food
great service
the staff took great care of our needs
the owner even assisted in waiting on us and brought us a free dessert at the end of our dining
we frequent indian_restaurants in all major cities we visit due to lack of options in arkansas
i would say this was one of the best we have been too
we visit las_vegas often and we will be visiting mount_everest during our next trip
well worth the cab ride from the strip and we just hailed a cab from the street when we left
this trip_to_vegas my husband put the kabosh on expensive strip restaurants
so after yelping the best off strip restaurants we decided to see what all the fuss was about
the bottom_line
in case you don't wanna read on
food so good we came here days in a row
don't let the neighborhood scare you
only a lil sketchy
the food is spectacular
best indian food we ever had
ever
we tried the mt_everest thali which was plenty of food for big eaters
the naan is yummers both plain and garlic
even the lamb
which i'm pretty picky about was so tasty
not gamey at all
our favorite dishes
chicken_tikka_masala
saag_paneer
we came back for the lunch buffet the day after
i highly_recommend it if you like variety and don't really know the names of the dishes
there wasn't a single thing we didn't like
not only is the food amazing but service is great
prakash is a great host
we will be coming here every time we come to vegas
i went here to convert two of my girlfriends to try and like indian food
and it was a success
a classmate of mine told me about this place
she said this is hands_down her favorite indian restaurant in the city
so after a couple months of persuading
my two friends who aren't so adventurous in cuisines as much as i am
finally decided to accompany me to mt
everest
i'd admit the venue is a bit sketchy but i just kept pulling the two inside
i already know my favorite indian dishes
so i ordered for my friends since they don't know what dishes are what
we went for chicken_tikka_masala
korma
and tandoori
i thought those dishes were the most
friendly
to those who've never had indian food before
so yeah
we also got garlic and regular naan combination
and mango_lassi
my favorite
i liked every dish we ordered
especially the korma
i can't stop dipping my garlic_naan into it
and the lassi was just perfect
i wanted to drink a whole pitcher if i could
the service was very friendly and he didn't hesitate to help us with any questions regarding the dishes
in past experiences with indian_restaurants
i felt_like the service have been quite rushed and somewhat rude
but mt
everest's server was quite congenial
i think the prices aren't bad and the serving was enough for people to share
i think i've found my go to indian restaurant
i'll definitely try their_lunch_buffet
hubby and i went here a couple of weeks_ago with a restaurant
com_coupon
we like indian food and based_on the reviews were looking_forward to this place
it was virtually empty when we arrived
and we_were_seated_immediately
i mentioned our coupon for off with a purchase of or more
so we had to eat a lot
easy enough
our waiter
who i think was also the owner manager
suggested the tandoori_chicken to start as an appetizer
eat a few pieces and take the rest home
which is what we did
the chicken was that awful red color that you find on most tandoori_chicken
but it was very moist and delicious as were the onions and peppers served along with the chicken
side note
we have only had tandoori_chicken at one other restaurant in town that wasn't that awful red
and it was the best ever
but i digress
we ordered two kinds of naan
garlic_naan and lamb filled naan
the lamb filled naan was ok
but didn't have a real lamby taste
but the garlic_naan omg i could have made a meal on just that
i wanted a lamb dish for my entree and rogan_josh was suggested
and it was delicious
very tender and the sauce was perfect
put some on my lamb
the rice and scooped up some with naan
my husband got a fish_curry
it seemed to me to be very much the same sauce that was on the lamb but with fish chunks in it
i wasn't crazy about it
but he really enjoyed it
we also had a cauliflower and potato dish that we really enjoyed
i forgot to order raita
which i usually love with indian food
we too got a complimentary rice_pudding dessert
which unfortunately we were too full to finish
but it was delicious too
so next time i'll make room for it
i didn't notice the neighborhood
it's in a strip_mall with a large mariani's supermarket behind it
it's not inexpensive
but definitely not over priced
while it is number two on our list of favorites
it is somewhat less expensive and definitely closer to home than our number one
so we will definitely be returning very soon
everest was part of my quest for the best indian food vegas had to offer
luckily
it was quite fantastic
i've been back a couple times
and both times have been full of great flavors
i don't remember the exact name
but there is an option on the menu i'm a huge_fan_of
it's essentially a large selection of their foods
in little metal dishes
lined up and ready for consumption
it's delicious
it's a great way to familiarize yourself with indian_cuisine quickly
if you're new to it all
both of my experiences here have been with this item
everything has been of great quality and flavor
like most indian_restaurants
the na'an is extra
however
you do have a choice of regular and garlic na'an
maybe some other choices as well
always go with garlic
you're welcome
the atmosphere is dark for dinner
almost questionably so
service is acceptable
although my first visit here wasn't positive in terms of recommendations
we asked some questions about the menu and they must have interpreted that as
you want everything you're asking about
we got a lot of food back
this wasn't good on the server's part
because really
who orders that many entrees without question
who doubles up on the same item
just keep a careful eye ear out
other than the overloaded order mishap
i'll have to be back hear for this amazing lunch buffet i keep hearing about
updates to come
mt
everest's food is good
it covers indian_cuisine from different parts of india
which is nice
the lunch buffet is huggggggggggggggge
like waaaaaaay tons of options
i like that they have sweet_rice
because that makes me think of my mom's sweet_rice
and well nostalgia makes everything taste better
they have a nice selection of meats too
i've_never_seen a lunch buffet serve goat meat
gotta give the props on that one
the naan is fresh and fluffy
i like that they give you both plain and garlic_naan
their roti is decent
overall
it's a good option when home_cooked indian food isn't happening
let me start by saying that the food is delicious
on most days
my review will be covering my lunch buffet experience only
so please keep that in mind when reading
pros
plenty of variety chicken_tikka
tandoori_chicken
saag_paneer and so forth
the naan is freshly_made
but be sure to mention custom requests such as garlic_naan etc while you are being seated
or they assume you want it plain
cons
while the food quality ranges from good to excellent
the customer_service is lacking
depending_on the season
the owner is a really chill guy
but he seems have person working all the tables sometimes
which gets chaotic during lunch rush
and customer_service suffers
i've noticed he's hired more staff lately
but i suspect its only seasonal
my note to him keep your location well staffed
i love their carrot dessert
gajar halwa
which is light years better than the sugary gulab_jamun
they have a salad_bar
which is decent
my advice to readers you better make sure you are leading an active lifestyle
if indian buffet is your goto for lunch
although the food here is tasty delicious goodness
its not really good for your body
authentic_indian_food isn't this greasy or creamy
and most indian people don't eat like this
because of the health implications of eating such loaded items
i tend to go there once every weeks
maybe once a month
i have eaten at everest many times
the aloo muttor gobi
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_biryani
garlic_naan
and more
the owner and staff have consistently been helpful
i will_be_returning soon
i'm a huge_fan_of indian food
it all started in a place back home in daytona beach fl just a few years_ago
since then i've been on the hunt for more great indian_restaurants
i just can't get enough of the chicken_makhani
also known as butter_chicken
lamb_korma and naan_bread
so yummy
this place was really great
the flavors were great and very fresh
i agree with all the reviews
i do think the service_was_a_bit_slow
it seemed the hostess was also taking orders and closing tickets
we had a show to go to so we literally had to take the check up to the register to pay our bill
i still don't think i have found a match for the place in daytona beach but this is very close
highly_recommended
no complaints or disappointments
i have been searching for a good indian restaurant in las_vegas
there are many place who claim to have it and they fall short
my first visit to mt
everest proved to be nothing less than fantastic
this family_owned and worked restaurant offers the authenticity i have been searching for
the food was nothing less than fantastic
it was fresh
delicious and great
we ordered the garlic_naan
chicken mahkhani
lamb saag and an onion potato cake
everything was delectable
additional note
the restrooms were extremely clean
which is another great sign of a restaurant for me
if they care enough to properly maintain their restrooms
then they genuinely care about their business
there are several restaurants in this valley that charge huge prices for everything and their bathrooms are trashed
i love_this_place
this truly is some of the best indian food you can get in las_vegas
their_lunch_buffet is awesome
and the best part is they are not afraid of actually giving some heat to their dishes unlike some of the other indian spots in vegas
the food
finally some heat with my lunch buffet food
the food here isn't too spicy it has just enough heat to get the job done
you start in the vegetarian section which has some amazing dishes then move your way to the meats
i love the chicken dishes and the goat_curry is one_of_my_favorites
you then move onto condiments and desert
make sure to grab some plain yogurt and chutney to dip your naan into
service
if anything is low just let the owner know and he has them cook it right away
service is excellent water or soda glasses are kept full
if you come in after they stop cooking for the buffet the owner will let you know when you walk in
he will also ask you to go take a look at what he has out to make sure you would like to stay
also don't forget if you are just driving by during the lunch buffet hours you can grab a to go box and load it up for the same price as the lunch buffet
this place is one of my favorite las_vegas indian food spots
it doesn't quite hit the same level as mint for me but it is up there
stopped by this place twice the last two times i went las_vegas
loved the mango_lassi
awesome service and friendly too
would go there again
my wife and i drove past this run down
ex burger_king shack on sahara dozens of times before we finally got over the creep factor and tried eating there
it was worth it
the atmosphere inside won't win any prizes but the food passes the test compared to the other indian options in town
the lunch buffet has some interesting selections you don't see very often
and overall we had a relaxing
tasty and filling weekday lunch here
we'll probably return when we don't feel like going all the way down to mint
the lesson
don't judge a restaurant by its fa ade
or its interior
for that matter
this place has the best_indian_food_in_town
i've lived in las_vegas years and i have tried many restaurants
and i keep_coming_back to this one and have never been disappointed
this one should go right up in the
best of las_vegas
along with pin kaow on rainbow
for best thai food
their_lunch_buffet is reasonably_priced and you get a lot of choices
their butter_chicken is the best
and their chicken curry is awesome also
and they serve you fresh naan with the buffet
if you go for dinner
its a lot more expensive
but you of course can order anything on the menu that way
the owner is always there at lunchtime and knows us too well because we are always there
i highly_recommend it
sg
mt
everest is a fantastic hole_in_the_wall indian restaurant
i had a few hours to kill before flying out of vegas today
and wanted to grab a leisurely bite to eat
while i'm not usually a fan of buffets
i'm a small dude
the value isn't there for me
i know the lunch buffet is the norm with indian_cuisine
everything was very fresh and tasty
the naan was particularly good
as was the vegetable daal
and the owner and his family were very friendly and accommodating
i don't pass through vegas often
but i'll stop at mt
everest the next time i'm in town
my_favorite_indian_restaurant
gaylord
is now out of business and other indian_restaurants i've been to have been mediocre which is why i'm_so_glad i gave mount_everest a try eventhough the place was kind of creepy
the quality of the food is comparable to gaylord's but you get more food and pay a lot less
the people that work here are very nice and friendly
they have bollywood videos on at all times
they give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces
we started of with samosa
they're like potato filled empanadas with ginger and spices
and aloo_tikki
fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick_pea batter
mango lasi
creamy mango shake
veggie_samosa
you get two pieces for
the crust was the right thickness and wasn't too doughy
you can definitely taste the spices
i had to use the tamarind_sauce to tone down the heat a bit
very filling
aloo_tikki
you get patties for
crispy deep_fried mashed potatoes
very filling as well
great flavor
palak_paneer
i was looking for the cheese on top since that's what i'm used to
garlic_naan
i love this stuff
we had orders
hot
garlicky and buttery bread to scoop dip saucy dishes with
chicken_tikka_masala
my favorite indian dish
we ordered mild but it was still quite spicy
but it burned so good
kulfi
a mild cheesy ice_cream and you can see pistachio bits
gulab_jamun
my favorite indian dessert
they're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup
i honestly wasn't expecting the food to be that good
this is my new favorite in vegas
they also have a lunch buffet from am pm for
i'd come back here for that
love_this_place
the food is great
i had the curry chickin and my fiance had a lamb dish
we also had a few appertizers
everything was so unbelievably tasty
fresh and the food was served piping_hot
the place was small and not really fancy but clean and a nice_atmosphere
awesome authentic_indian_food
ambience is not that good but the food is just great
one of the best in us
i love_this_place
i love how every time i need another refill it has already been done
they have this chilli chicken dish which is little pieces of chicken covered in their special chilli sauce and cooked for long time to become delicious as it is
i have been trying to find a great indian place for a while and this one does it for me
i love the service here and will continue to come back
being spoiled with california's many indian_restaurants
i was sad when i came back to las_vegas to find a very limited selection of places to get my chicken_tikka_masala and garlic_naan cravings taken_care_of
i thought the only way to get my fix was to fly back to the bay to get it
but then i came across this place
i have probably driven passed this place a billion times before i considered to try it and honestly
it wasn't until i saw the awesome ratings from yelpers before i decided it was a go
boy am i happy i did
everything on their menu is so flavorful and rich
my boyfriend and i looooooooove this place
it's inside of what used to be a burger_king in front of the mariana's supermarket
the area isn't aesthetically pleasing
but don't you dare judge a book by it's cover
their service is hospitable
kind of quiet and shy
but hospitable nonetheless
their mango lasse is amazeballs
their chai is alright
probably wouldn't order it again though
the papadams
spelling
and the little sauces that get served before you order are so dainty and delicious
if you ever come for their_lunch_buffet
don't plan on eating for the rest of the day
haha
they have an awesome selection and everything is fresh
we're so excited that we found this place
the boyfriend and i were talking_about how we don't know why indian food has such a negative social stigma when it's actually delicious
but i guess we don't really mind
more for us
the portions were larger than we expected
the mango_lassi was delicious
and they have a huge variety_of_dishes on their menu
it is very rare that i change my first impression
but that was the case here with this one
my first visit to mount_everest was not a good one
i didn't think there naan was good
didn't try the sweet_rice
and the samosas were overcooked
well
wow
i have been back like
times in the past month since that initial visit
it is by far my favorite indian lunch buffet place
i had in the running but mt_everest is on top
first
the price
i believe it is
not bad
second
the choices
it has the most choices i've seen
what could make this place better
if their labels were more specific
i love the way some buffets put
vegetarian
as a vegetarian i like a quick reference guide to vegetarian_options
but
with my minor knowledge of indian food i know what most of their dishes are
if it were my first exposure to indian food
however
i would be s
o
l
also another thing they could make better
their naan
i don't like their naan
i like buttery
garlicy soft guusy naan
this is not my favorite place for naan
saffron is
if you like medium textured
little buttered
barely garlic ed naan then you would like it
other than that
it's so good
their choices are amazing
final thing
this is the nutrition student in me
they are so sanitary
one of the only indian_buffets i've seen with in place
sneeze guards
on their buffet
their buffet is actually buffet style so it has the coverings
furthermore
their bathroom has a sanitary spray above the handle
how great
so even if nasties don't wash their hands
i won't get their germs from when they open the bathroom door open
foodborne illness is no joke
yo
p
s
try the sweet_rice
p

the bollywood they play on tv is a great compliment to the atmosphere
a colleague and i changed our business lunch venue to mount_everest today and i'm sooooo glad_we_did
i love indian food and haven't had any in a while other than the boil in a pouch variety from trader joe's so i jumped at the chance to try a place in town i hadn't been to before
just pulling up and waiting outside the aroma was so enticing i could tell good things awaited
of course
since we were there for lunch we got the buffet
as someone who primarily eats vegetarian_vegan i was immediately impressed with the number of veggie dishes offered and i loved the fact that they separated the meat dishes into a different station all together
everything i loaded up my plate with was delish
from the basmati_rice
dal
veggie_korma
samosas and pakoras everything was outstanding
the service was super kind and prompt too
i'll be back with my husband in tow next time
hands_down the best indian food i've had in the us
spicy actually means spicy
the samosa's were fantastic
the service was great
we had samosa's
garlic_naan
raita
lamb_vindaloo
chicken kadai
the best dish of the night
all for
unlike most indian places
portions were big enough to take some home
we probably wont try another place in las_vegas
seriously good
left_overs didn't last til lunch
had it for breakfast
super yum
best part is its very clean authentic indian
not that greasy chewy stuff you might get other places
loved this place will def
be going again
came again after our initial visit and we had a much more enjoyable experience
the server was friendly_and_attentive this time around and kept our_water_glasses full and answered any questions we had
i am addicted to the chicken curry
i didn't know i liked indian food till i found myself at home craving the creamy
flavorful curry with moist bits of chicken
mmmmm
i think the lunch buffet is definitely worth it at around since dinner entr es can add up
all the other buffet items are just bonuses but the chicken curry with garlic_naan are what will keep me coming_back for more
hot tip
get the garlic_naan
way better than the regular naan but make sure to place the order as soon as you sit_down or they will bring out the regular naan and you can't order a new batch till you finish it haha
modest atmosphere great food
i went with a couple of friends while in sin city
garlic_naan fluffy and garlicy yum
samosas solid not amazing
mint tamarind chutneys were really good
chicken_tikka_masala outstanding
chicken kardai really good
lamb_vindaloo great flavor lamb a bit tough
saag great flavor
rice nice
owner couldn't have been nicer
his son even drove us to the closest hotel to catch a cab because it would have been more than minutes for one to come
get off the strip and get some real indian grub here
thursday lunch
spouse and i arrived at about
and were seated quickly by a friendly male
the booth had white linen table cloth and white cloth napkins with better than the usual flatware and water goblet
unfortunately
lunch is only the buffet for
it is not clear if this is all_you_can_eat
a menu is only for dinner
the buffet had a
sneeze
shield with sticky notes with handwritten names for whatever was under the shield
the labels were for the indian name of the dish
not very helpful if you're not an indian speaker
the
wet
items were soupy and the
dry
items were dry to an extreme
the two best items
imho
were the chicken curry and the white rice
while the others were forgettable
the condiments i normally associate with curry
like coconut
peanuts
grated onion
etc
were absent
although the chutney was present
but unremarkable as chutney
i would hazard a guess that those giving five_stars are native speakers and are familiar with the food in the buffet
since i'm neither
this made things awkward
this place is great
the food is excellent and we were served by the owner
he was very nice
i talked my husband into trying a different cuisine and he was weary about the place from the looks on the outside
if it was not for the open sign we probably would not have stopped
the inside is very nice
linen on the tables and clean
we are early eaters so we were the start of their dinner crowd
it filled up quickly as we ate
we ordered the garlic_naan and it was awesome
made to order
my husband had the lamb_korma on my recommendation and i had the chicken_korma
they also have a veggie_korma that is probably just as good
portion_sizes are large
don't judge a book by its cover or you will miss out on some really outstanding indian_cuisine
my husband liked it so much he wants to go back before we leave las_vegas
that does not happen often and means he really liked it as did i
this place was great
we went for the lunch buffet on the recordation of a friend
it was excellent
had never had sweet_rice before and it was awesome
the naan was excellent and it was great to try a bunch of different dishes
will deffinately be going back
right off
i'm very stingy with giving out stars and i'm not likely to assign any value to the outside of any place
this restaurant is not much to look at from the outside but is a medium to small restaurant that is pleasantly decorated inside with a friendly_staff
the lunch buffet is served in some of the nicest heated tables
one iced table for the cold menu
with covered chafing dishes
the food is kept hotter than any other buffet with dishes refreshed regularly
the one meat table is separate from the vegetable tables
a nice feature for vegetarians to avoid cross contamination
every dish was delicious
although i would have liked to have one main potato dish
there were potato samosas and a great mixed_vegetable dish with potatoes
and would drop up to half a star for the menu selection
the food was fresh
perfumed
and not overly south_indian hot
the obligatory tandoori_chicken was both flavorful and moist
i suspect that the heated tables and covered chafing dishes help maintain the quality of the food
the pakora were a little crunchy
maybe not perfect
but tasty
given that there are no half stars
the only negatives were not worthy of dropping to four stars considering our overall satisfaction
we arrived for a late lunch
around
but the food was great and refreshed before the dish was emptied
keeping the quality up
the plain_naan arrived before we were back from the buffet and i would have liked to have garlic_naan
but no one asked
i guess it is important to ask right away for naan other than plain
but the plain_naan was good
the service was fine with dishes cleared and water refilled
but a little invisible and surprisingly shy
for any questions
just call out for them they really don't want to disturb your meal
overall
the fixtures were superior
the dining_room was kept clean
and every dish on the buffet was terrific
not quite the huge selection found in some of the buffets in silicon valley
but it was all good
hard to believe that any other indian buffet in vegas will beat this spot for quality and value
this is now our go to indian restaurant for vegas
my husband and i must have gone here on a really off day for them
we ate at the ayce lunch buffet and i felt_like we were eating their scraps
food wasn't hot
just warm enough to eat
the chicken and lamb was dry
they forgot our drink_orders and then when they finally did come out
they got our order wrong
the food was just ok
some of it was not edible though
i hate wasting food
so i usually eat it if i don't think it's the best
but some of it
i just couldn't eat because it was either too dry or just didn't taste right
i hate to say it but i would never come back here again
especially since we have found better
lunch buffet
yummy garlic_naan
one of the best indian_buffets in vegas for a great price
the curries are amazing and tasty
spices were phenomenal
from the outside appearance it looks like a
hole_in_the_wall
but the interior was clean and pleasant
near strip
i highly_recommend mt
everest
we would go there more often f we lived closer
went in for the lunch buffet i believe it was like
anyways
food was good they could have filled up buffet a little more
as everyone was taking all of the chicken
but overall very good
the decor could use some sprucing up and cleaning but overall great indian at a good price with good service
did a lot of yelp searching for indian restaurant for dinner on our stay here in las_vegas
that led us here and we loved it
environment is delightful
white linen tablecloth
private booth
enjoyed navarattan korma and paleek paneer and garlic_naan
mango_chutney
tasty mango_lassi
delicious and authentic
and great service
owner very hospitable
we loved it
i visited this restaurant last_night while in town on a business trip based_on previous reviewers from yelp
i was glad that the outward appearance of the restaurant had been mentioned
as it may have kept me from going in if i had just been driving by
once you enter though
it's a great environment with the white tablecloths and napkins
as someone dining alone
i particularly enjoyed the bollywood playing in the corner
it kept me entertained while i was waiting for my food
which was an excellent break from the standard of playing with my phone
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
which is my basis for judging a restaurant
much like pad thai at a thai restaurant
the sauce was amazingly creamy
and had a slow burn to it
which i find the hallmark of a good sauce
i want the spice
but not at the expense of the flavor
the naan was perfect with a crispy edge and soft center
ideal for sopping up the sauce
but even more than the food
the service was phenomenal
everyone is very friendly
but give you your space
my water never got below half way full
and i can put away water like a camel
so that's impressive
and when i had a problem
they were endlessly gracious and worked with me while i figured it out
few restaurants would take the time or effort to come up with a mutually satisfying solution the way that they did
end result
if i lived here
i'd weigh a million pounds because i would eat here all the time
as it is
i'll have to settle for stopping in every time i'm in town
well i knew it would take something really special for me to write my first ever yelp review and mount_everest india's_cuisine did it
i have eaten curry all around the world london
new york
los angeles
johannesburg
mumbai and by far the best malai_kofta i have ever eaten was right here at mount_everest in vegas
perfectly spiced
amazing flavor
exceptional texture
its conveniently just a few minutes from the strip
very reasonably_priced
exceptionally friendly_staff and just great food
highly_recommended
wow
the first sign that mt
everest was going to be a good restaurant was the complex scent of spices that hit our noses
the next sign was that it was crowded
and most of the customers were indian
we had chicken curry and kauli aloo and found them to be fragrant
tasty
and freshly prepared
the garlic_naan was great
the staff was friendly and prompt
the prices were more than reasonable
we literally just left this place
yes
from the outside appearance you make be tempted to pass by
but i assure you the hospitality and interior setting makes_up_for_it
all the staff are wonderful and attentive but not too assertive and in your face
oh goodness the food
we had the chicken masala and the chicken curry
spice_level and we were not disappointed
the food was so delicious and comforting if that makes sense
my wife loves beer and she had the taj_mahal which she said went very well with the masala
their indian chai_tea was wonderful as well
please order the garlic_naan
so fresh and perfectly made
it was just an amazing experience
and i am huge on customer_service so i thank the staff
please go
myself and a bunch of coworkers go here for the lunch buffet and it always pleases
a decent amount of options for a reasonable_price
i've yet to have a bad experience
the food is great and the service is good too
i definitely recommend it
it was ok
loved the food
but the customer_service needs a little work
but i will recommend to olthers
yum
the first time we came to mount_everest was a year_ago when we were in vegas
it was so good that when we came back to vegas this year
we put it on our list of things to do
i'm still trying to find an indian place in az that's as good as this one
if you're a fan of chicken_tikka_masala
you have to try it at mount_everest
it's the best that i have ever tasted
and i'm just sad that i have to come all the way to las_vegas to get it
it was even better than i remembered and i ate way too much just because it tasted so good i didn't want to stop_eating it
the garlic_naan is also delicious
the service is friendly_and_attentive
and the location cozy
in a good way
i wish i could buy the food in bulk and ship it to az
we'll_be_back
for sure
if you're in the vegas area looking for great indian food
this is the place to be
great service by the friendly_staff and owner and rich
tasty food in generous portions
this food leaves you truly satisfied
not just full
i've been there for lunch and i've been there for dinner
this is my favorite indian food in las_vegas
the flavors are all there
but it's not as expensive as many other indian_restaurants_in_town that i find to have less appealing food
as far as buffets go
their_lunch_buffet is excellent
they always have several of my favorite indian dishes available and they keep the warm
fresh
pillowy naan_bread coming
the only problem i have is that i overeat every time i come here for the lunch buffet
last_night was my first time trying their dinner menu
and it was so delicious
we started with vegetable_samosas which were cooked very well
the had a perfect crisp on the outside and beautifully seasoned potato filling inside
then for our entrees
i ordered lamb_vindaloo and my wife ordered chicken kurma
and we both ordered garic naan to go with it
unlike many other indian_restaurants_in_town
mt
everest doesn't charge extra for rice
i very much appreciated that
the lamb_vindaloo was the best i've had
so flavorful
the kurma was very tasty
but a little too sweet for my tastes
my wife loved it though and couldn't stop raving about it the entire meal
she's already mentioned to me how much she's looking_forward to eating her leftovers
somebody in a previous review seemed to think the fact it's in a building where a burger_king used to be
and in a predominantly hispanic neighborhood is a bad thing
me
i don't care where it is or what used to be there as long as delicious food and great service provided
this place has both
the owner even brought us out a free rice_pudding for dessert for us to try
i don't think that's standard for all guests
but it was delicious
i would recommend mt
everest india's_cuisine to everybody
my favorite indian food in vegas
always yummy and full of flavor
service is usually on point
the reason i took off one star is brach of the ambiance
it's not so great
it's actually inside of a converted burger which
while converted
is still not the most tranquil setting
also
not in the best area of town
that being said
i still love love love it and will continue to frequent the place
amazing food
great prices
excellent service
i'd happily come here again
get the paneer_pakora
it is excellent
just as fantastic as my last visit
great food
flavor was awesome
spice was out_of_this_world
my only suggestion would be to turn the a c on
the warm weather combined with the spice of the food makes for an uncomfortable visit
lunch buffet
great food
service was mediocre
what with the owner employee talking on the phone while tending customers
but the food makes_up_for_it
naan was fresh and soft
a decent amount of choices at the buffet
but everything tasted amazing
it is most definitely worth_the_trip away from the strip to come here
hands_down the best indian lunch buffet in vegas
one in a while
they have the
carrot pudding
and it is amazing
their paneer has great texture and in great texture
i mean it is soft enough to absorb flavor and hard enough to not break apart
the chefs at everest know what they're doing
if your in vegas and your at all a fan_of_indian_food
stop here
the neighborhood is a little sketchy and the place is an old fast_food_joint
but be brave
inside it's comfortable and clean
and on the hot day that we visited it was cool
we had the sample plate that had a smattering of various indian dishes
and all were very good
the owner and waiter were very nice and answered all questions we had about the food
we will go again next time we are in town
we had a short vacation to vegas this year and mt
everest was the best thing that happened to us
we had both the lunch buffet and dinner here and was one of the best indian food places my wife and i have ever been to in the us
their naan and paneer dishes were made from scratch and you can taste the fresh_ingredients cooked_to_perfection
service was great and the owner too was very friendly
i really look_forward to visit this place again on our next trip
indian food lovers this place is a must visit during your vegas trip
best indian food and buffet in las_vegas
a great value
we decided to try this place based_on it's pretty consistent yelp_reviews
and we're glad_we_did
a few reviewers have mentioned the sketchy surroundings
but i say if you can throw some carpet
a few tablecloths
and the drapes from an old bordello into a defunct burger_king and come up with a perfectly comfortable dining_room
more power to ya
i have loved indian food since i first discovered it during a brief sojourn in london
when it seemed that the only options were steak and kidney pie or starving to death
i chose the latter
valar morghulis
anyway
as a person who considers curry to be more of a drug than a food
i'm usually prepared to like what i get in indian_restaurants
which is a little meat floating in a sea of delicious sauce which you happily sop up with some fluffy
toasty naan
and fill up on the rice
i'm getting hungry again just thinking about it
the difference here was that there was plenty of tender
juicy meat in that sauce
apparently a side benefit of keeping the rent low
hope they don't get too big for their britches and move to summerlin
goodbye
meat
i adore chicken_korma and theirs was perfect
rich creamy sauce with just a little sweetness and those complex
spicy undertones that keep you coming_back for more bites long after you're full
chicken_tikka and tandoori were both served sizzling and still moist and juicy
the favorite appetizer
in a unanimous vote
was the lamb samosas
they were golden little pockets of pastry stuffed with seasoned
finely ground lamb
but the best thing was what wasn't there
my sister didn't find a hard thing
mind you
if there is ground meat involved
be it burgers
sausage
meatballs
whatever
she always gets the hard thing
and the rest of us have to suffer along with her
it's one of life's little miracles that she didn't
and practically worth a sixth star
will_definitely_return to try the lunch buffet
but don't be surprised if they raise the price after our visit
don't judge a book by it's cover
the outside may appear to have been a former fast_food_joint
but inside you will find a great indian restaurant with a good selection of indian dishes
lunch time prices_are_reasonable and the establishment got pretty busy within minutes after opening
good sign
my wife and i were impressed with the selection from the saagaloo
to the chicken_tika and tika_masala
this restaurant is about miles west of the strip near palace station casino
the casino where oj finally got arrested
this indian restaurant as well as taj_palace
located in henderson
are my two favorite indian_restaurants
we've been here for dinner several times and tried out the lunch buffet
if you're going for the lunch buffet
try to plan around traditional lunch times because it gets busy and there is about square feet of waiting area directly in front of the door
that being said
this is our favorite indian food restaurant so far
the service is maybe a little slow
even when they are not busy
but the food is worth it
the hubs sticks to the standard tikka masala
but we've had the jel frezi and vindaloo as well
everything was fantastic
the lunch buffet is a great way to sample a bunch of their foods too
we'll definitely_be_going_back for more
i've never gone here for dinner
only for the lunch buffet
if you enjoy eating a lot of meat
you'll probably be disappointed with the lunch buffet
but
that's normal for most indian_buffets i've been to
i usually only eat the vegetarian_dishes
the naan is better than most i've tried
it's soft and thick
rather than the tortilla bread like naan you find at some places
they also have basic potato samosas and vegetable_pakora
sadly
i don't get to come as often
because i don't work nearby anymore
we have eaten here a couple_of_times now
their entrees
especially paalak paneer and tarka dal
taste fresh and delicious
garlic_naan and tandoori roti were good but we won't order the onion kulcha again
also
save your money and don't get the aloo_tikki appetizer
the reason i am not giving them stars is because we did not enjoy our dinner experience last saturday because the service went at a snail's pace and we waited for mins between our appetizers and main_courses
the manager went around asking how everything was
but he had moved on to the next table before he hearing our reply
it was clear that he was doing his job half heartedly and did not really care about his customers
the outside of the restaurant does no justice to the restaurant
if i had not read_the_reviews
we would turn and drive away
i have been here for buffett and it was pretty good with a very nice lamb_curry
tonight we are here for a take out
unfortunately we waited for over min for our food
like all indian foods
the potions are surprisingly small during dinner specially if you are used to indian_buffets
the quality of the food is good
overall i rather go to indian when they have buffett
this indian food was soo delicious
it was not too expensive
my friend and i split a veg thali special and it was more than enough
so much flavor
wish i never got full so i could keep eating
this was a nice little find off the strip
we came for the lunch buffet which was
person
buffet items
vegetable_korma
yellow daal
chana_masala
vegetable_samosa
sweet_rice
basmati_rice
vegetable_pakora
chicken tandoori
chili_chicken
chicken_makhani
chicken curry
goat_curry and the best part was that they had my favorite gulab_jamun
the chicken curry was very flavorful
it had a great balance of creaminess and spices
it also contained big chunks of chicken which is what most people tend to skimp on
abundance of protein is always a plus in a buffet dish
i was surprised that they had goat_curry
gamey stuff is not my cup of tea so this one i did not try
the gulab_jamun were little balls of perfection
service
our server was very attentive and quick to refill our glass_of_water
i subtracted a star b c although the gulab was legit
they only had the gulab and rice_pudding for dessert
there was no mango pudding or the carrot_halwa the sweet carrot dessert
but i guess you can't have everything
i also wasn't a fan of their naan that they offered
a good naan has a little bit of crispiness and some flavor
this naan had no flavor whatsoever and was very thick and heavy
it was more of a pita than a naan
for
i would come again
my favorite biryani spot
i had visitors in town so we came here for dinner
as always
prakash was amazing
even though he was busy entertaining the other guests
he came by to check on us
we had lamb_biryani chicken_biryani last_night
it was delicious
we enjoyed it to the max
the chai masala was yummy too
i've been here so many times and their food has always been the best
my friends was happy with the dishes ordered
i would recommend all my friends to come have buffet lunch or dinner at mount_everest india's_cuisine
thanks for being awesome
it was my first time having indian food so i was excited_to_try mount_everest
i went for dinner with a group_of_people
we didn't make a reservation but they were still able to accommodate us pretty quickly
we ordered paneer_pakora and chicken pakora as appetizers
both which were really good
they also offered free papadom along side the appetizers
most of us ordered chicken entrees
all which were pretty delicious
a friend_of_mine ordered the prawn vindaloo which i really liked
the dishes were rich and spicy and there was enough where we could share with each other
i would_definitely_come_back
the prices were good and the staff was attentive and friendly
the only thing that got me is that i thought the restaurant would be bigger than i expected but other than that
i liked mt
everest
dive into this incredible buffet bucks
star i love indian
and they do it really great here
and you cannot beat the price
small place in the ghetto
sahara and valley view
not too ghetto
but still
its not pretty on this corner
but inside
you forget about it quick when you start salivating at the door
and running to the buffet like a wild animal ready to eat yourself silly
take a breath
its ok
this place will give you everything you need
every indian spice is in something
the quality and freshness is stellar
hightly recommended
just see the other reviews
dont take my word for it
try it and take you own word
its amazing
we had dinner one night and came back a few days later for the lunch buffet
both were excellent
we've tried a few other places on the strip but this place is far better
worth the short side trip
one of the best indian_restaurants i've been to in a ling time
service was fast courteous and friendly
food was authentically delicious
the selection of really good indian_restaurants in las_vegas is somewhat limited
but thank goodness for mount_everest
from the outside it looks like a converted fast_food_joint
used to be a burger_king
but inside the decor and atmosphere are what you would expect in an authentic upscale indian restaurant offering fine_dining
to cut a long story short
i have eaten at mount_everest on several occasions
the food is excellent as is the service
portions are generous and the prices_are_very_reasonable
i have tried many indian_restaurants in vegas and none of them come close to mount_everest highly_recommended
i feel drunk after dinner not because of drinks but with all the great spices they have on the food
we had chicken_tikka_masala and prawn vindulo with garlic_naan
the flavors were all great especially the masala
i think it's the best one i've ever tasted
the portion_size was also just right compared to the other indian_restaurants i've been too
the only downside is the service that's why i'm giving it stars
the servers were very nice but they were short handed
they need more people there
we will be back for sure
if you like indian food
this is the place to go in vegas
pleasant atmosphere
waiters are very friendly
and the food
first
he naan_bread is the best i ever had in the usa or europe
i had a chicken_korma
it was perfect
creamy
delicate and a big portion
love_this_place
will be back soon
great food
good vibes
the onion bread was off the charts
go for lunch and enjoy the buffet
the samosas
oh the samosas
food is really good but dinner portions to go are tiny
i spent on my favorite cauliflower dish that was really small and half of it was potatoes
highly disappointed by the portion_size considering how much it costs and that you can have all_you_can_eat at the lunch buffet for the price of small dinner dish
best bet is just to go for the lunch buffet unless you have extra money to spend on multiple dinner dishes
we spent on dinner for about the same amount of food we eat at the lunch buffet
maybe i'm just a gluttonous pig
after seeing the great reviews_on_yelp
i decided to try out mount_everest india's_cuisine
i had never tried indian food before
and wanted to try something new for dinner so i brought along my two buddies for the ride
upon arriving
we were greeted with quick and prompt service
which was a very big plus in my book
all the workers there were very kind
and quickly assisted us with whatever we needed
my friends and i wanted to try different things and share
so we ordered a prawn curry
chicken biriyani
garlic_naan
and a very very spicy chicken biriyani
when the food arrived
i felt_like i was in heaven
everything smelled so good and looked so flavorful
i immediately started to dig in
the garlic_naan was amazing
and felt_like it just melted in my mouth
i even ordered another round because it was so good
the prawn curry was the right amount of spicy for me and very delicious
it was big enough for us to split between people
the chicken biriyani was very flavorful and had tender chunks of chicken mixed inside
it was definitely something i would order again
my first trip to an indian restaurant was a good one
i hope to come back sometime soon and try out something new
mt
everest has amazing food
i came here for the
buffet and was amazed at the quality of food
the servers were also very attentive
the buffet had authentic indian pakistani food that would rival any_other_indian_restaurant in las_vegas
will_definitely_be_back again
this was a really great place to go with my bestie
we love to try lots of things and at the lunch buffet price who could argue
it is a small place and i wondered how come there wasn't a line to eat this yumminess
we went around pm to miss the lunch rush
i think we did right
can't_wait_to_go_back
i'm a indian food lover and had a indian craving while on mini vacay in vegas
stumbled upon this place on yelp and due to the great reviews i decided_to_give this place a shot
we were greeted and sat immediately
the food on the buffet looked pretty good so we went with that
oh boy
what a good life decision that was
just about everything i put on my plate was above_average in flavor
usually at an indian buffet there are at least items that get left on my plate
not here
the only thing i didn't care for was the potato samosas
and that's strictly due to the too thick
not crispy pastry surrounding the well spiced potato filling
the butter_chicken was good
made with a mix of white and dark meat
and had a nice deep flavor throughout the chicken and sauce
the paneer palak was wonderful and flavorful with a kick of chilies
my partner in crime enjoyed the veggie_korma greatly
as did i
it was creamy
with well rounded flavors and tasted very unique compared_to_other veggie kormas i've had
heck it put mine to shame
they didn't shy away from spice or heat as some indian places do to adapt to american palates and i dig them for it
service_was_a_bit_slow
plates weren't cleared as fast as i would've liked them to be
and my_water_glass was parched a few times but i'll cut them some slack for being a bit short staffed the day we went
overall it was great
been back pretty much once a week and everything is good as always
food is always hot and fresh and never dried_out
prakash always gives me extra paneer when they're out
nice guy
great food
and better yet
great service
a great alternative if you want to get away from the strip
trust_me i was skeptical at first
like you
who is currently reading this
th wall
but it was worth the risk
excellent indian food
saw the previews
went to try it out last_night
good was good but the price was kinda high compared to the taste of the food
overall
it was great
i used to dislike ethnic cuisines
thats when i was stupid
now that i have more food experience indian food is one of my new faves
love love love
this place is amazing
i'm completely addicted to their garlic_naan and braised goat
just delish
i never liked indian food before and this place changed my mind completely
you must try everything here
the spices and sauces are perfect
had a dinner for two here during a weekday and ordered their mount_everest thali special for
it was just_the_right_amount_of food for heavy eaters like us but would probably be too much for the average appetite
the quality is above_average and quite enjoyable
kinda like good home cooking
the restaurant was quite clean and the service was friendly and prompt despite the restaurant being more than half occupied
i can't recommend getting their thali combos enough
it's like getting a tasting menu as you'll get quite a good variety of staple indian dishes
overall
i'd eat here again
you get so much eating satisfaction for the money
great indian food
the owners it's always welcoming
family_owned and pops are in the kitchen
authentic
affordable and great overall
cheese and peppers dish
lamb_curry and the winner
naan
awesome authentic_indian_food
we were bunch of indian guys who are very finicky about indian food
after a long tiring weekend
we wanted to have indian food to energize
it is the most authentic_indian_food that you can taste
i usually judge the restaurant through their yellow dal
dal fry
dish as that is the most basic dish
it was simply amazing
i loved all the vegetarian_options for sure
would definitely go there if i am in vegas again
another favorite in vegas definitely the best indian in town
i've been to the lunch buffet and the a la_carte dinner
while the buffet is certainly worth the price i love coming for dinner so that i can order exactly what i want
the garlic_naan is a must
and i recommend it with some plain yogurt on the side
for main_courses i really love the lamb
or vegetable
korma and the chicken_tiki_masala
i get both on medium
level and it still has a good amount of spice
i'd say those two sauces are my favorites since i've tried others that are not as memorable to me
i don't love the chicken_tikka but probably only because i'm a big sauce girl
i also really enjoy the okra vegetable dish
full of flavor
though the talk of slow service is true i'd say the food is too good to pass up and don't mind the service
i also like to finish my meal with a chai_tea at the end
overall great place eating so many delicious spices just makes me feel very warm and calm on the inside i would definitely consider this
comfort_food
just delicious
i can't_handle too much spice and this had just the right amount
there was such a variety of foods at the lunch buffett
for
you can't_go_wrong
and the staff were so friendly
great lunch buffet
loved their malai_kofta
and their service cannot be beat
the owner is such a nice gentleman
he let us stay past closing as we waited for a cab to come get us
my only critique is that it isn't closer to the strip and therefore isn't as easy to get to
more people need to make this a stop on their trips to vegas
great food and great service
love_this_place
awesome lunch buffet
don't let the outside fool you
this place is nice
food is fresh
good
service great
ayce indian lunch buffet review
from the first bite
bam
more spices
a little more heat
and much more flavor than all the other lunch_buffets i've been to so far
indian food is like thai food to me
the more spicy it is
the better it tastes
you get much more flavor and depth in the curries and misc
so it's much more enjoyable
and the garlic_naan of course
the most
garlicky
i've had
so much flavor
yum
i think we ate three baskets while we were here lol
super cheap prices
gonna be hard to beat at only
weeeee
pics
i went there for a lunch buffet with a group_of_people during our visit to las_vegas
food was decent
being an indian
i would expect the items on the buffet to be little bit hot and spicy
but it wasn't the case here
some of the dishes were sweet with little or no salt
that is the reason i gave it stars
the garlic naans served was great
the kheer
gulab_jamun and sweet honey rice were good
overall i recommend it
will definitely visit the next time i come to visit vegas
their_lunch_buffet is amazing
truly an amazing deal and you're really getting wonderful food at such a great price
when i arrived a few minutes after my friend
we already had a basket of fresh naan and waters
the naan was fluffy
tasty
crispy
and just so scrumptious
the selection was awesome
the dishes that stood_out for me were the basmati_rice
vegetable_korma
vegetables in creamy sauce
vegetable_samosa
baked pastry with spiced potato mix
and tandoori_chicken
roasted chicken marinated with spices
my absolute favorite dish had to be the chicken_makhani
chicken in creamy tomato based gravy
oh my goodness
it was so
so delicious
amazing flavor and it went well with everything
the naan
rice
and even the samosas
i really liked the samosas as well because the pastry was extremely tasty and wonderfully crunchy
the potato mixture inside was also delightful
we also tried the chicken curry and goat_curry
both prepared with the respective meats
tomatoes
and spices
good
but overshadowed by the amazing makhani
the aloo baingan
eggplant with potatoes
was tasty and prepared very well
but not something i loved
the last item i tried was the chili_chicken
chicken with garlic
green chili
and onion
but i didn't like it
plus
it was way too spicy for me
service was really great too
our waters were refilled quickly and frequently
we also received a naan refill promptly
i was extremely pleased with the whole experience
this is seriously great food and i can't_wait_to_go_back
too hyped up
service was slow
food was not super hot
at a level
i couldn't taste any spicy ness
vegetable khorma was good
tikka massala could've been better
i do have to say that the garlic_naan and the raita were amazing
i miss la indian food
i have now been to this place times for their_lunch_buffet
i can't give this place stars
but they are better than stars
a
is what i'd truly rate this place
the vegetarian_options are delicious
don't know all the names but i can say that what i ate was definitely tasty
the best dish
however is a toss up between their chili_chicken and rice_pudding dessert
for very different reasons each dish is tasty
the chili_chicken has heat and a delectable blend_of_spices
the rice_pudding is just sweet enough and a refreshing end to a meal filled with spicy goodness
if you're a fan of indian_cuisine or first timer
i'd suggest you try this place
there is something for everyone
and if it counts for anything
my indian coworker says mt_everest is better than mint and india marsala
not bad at all
food was not spicy enough
usually a out of is spicy for me
we had to add hot_sauce
fairly priced
decent food
the only one
i wanted to stray from cuisine i was already familiar with
so i grabbed a handful of friends who were up for something new and came here after looking at some reviews
it was our first time trying indian food
and i have to say
i do quite like it
an lunch buffet is a great price
there's a lot of room in there
and there is variety in the dishes from what i can tell
i spooned a little bit of everything on my plate and nearly everything i tried i was a fan of
the naan came
and the garlic_naan was as good as everyone on yelp had said
my friends were also fans of the sweet_rice
i think it paired perfectly with the chicken curry
the service was awesome
too
being first timers
they were all very helpful
they made more sweet_rice for us even when they were around minutes away from closing and didn't hesitate to let us know what the fennel was for by the entrance
lol
overall
this place is a great experience for those who want to try it
i like this place
everything is fresh
the restaurant is clean
and the prices_are_reasonable
i would definitely recommend them
lunch buffet was good can't say it was the best indian food i ever had but good
we got there around saturday afternoon waited for a table just a few minutes
every thing was good is it possible foods were heavier than other indian_restaurants
i thought the foods were heavier
they did not serve garlic_nan just regular nan disappointed a little bit
i would recommend_this_place good place for something different but i don't think i would come back soon
great value
great food
friendly people
defiantly worth stopping in if you are up for an indian lunch buffet
my favorite neighborhood food
always on point with deliciousness and a smile
great great great food and really reasonable_prices
the buffet is a go to
and they are open late
and they have they buffett everyday
boom
this is the place for a great indian lunch buffet
there were a lot of excellent vegetarian_options
chicken and really good fresh garlic_nan
also a very friendly host who took good care of us
i'll look_forward to lunch here again
this place was awesome
seriously as_good_as_it_gets
especially out in middle of nowhere las_vegas
super authentic
great food
and gigantic portions
very simple establishment and totally_worth it
you totally get what you pay for at mount_everest
get the samosa chat
thank me later
if you are an indian food lover
the smell when you walk into what surely was once a fast_food chain will slap you in the face and get your mouth_watering
the menu will only frustrate
as everything looks great
i went with the vindaloo
lamb
an order of naan
and glass of merlot
the merlot was about what you can expect for
the naan was a scoach undercooked and bland
the vindaloo was damn near perfect
the waiter simply asked if i like spicy
no number game
and the dish was the just the right amount to get your tongue tingling
but not overwhelming
sure the decor maybe flavorless and the staff unprofessional
a busser assistant in a stocking hat
but the spices are dead on
i plan many 'o follow up at the summit of everest
absolutely fantastic food best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
and i've had a lot
not knowing what some of the items were
i asked and the owner himself
pravat or something like that hard to remember foreign names my bad
came over and answered everything to a tee
my family and i are in lv once a year and will certainly be back in
delicious
with excellent selection
don't let the exterior fool you
the food is amazing
without the reviews_on_yelp we may have drove right by
my husband and i went to have some dinner and we didn't realize the time
the restaurant was actually closed and the owner prakash welcomed us and gave_us the option to order take out
we really appreciated that
and we were worried that his staff would be upset with us for ruining their closing routine
prakash was so nice and he took our order and we even ordered extra sides after we had put the original order in
and he still accommodated us
we will definitely come here again within hours when we are in town next time
the food was amazing spicy and fresh
we absolutely loved it
chicken_vindaloo is incredible
the manager gave_us a great personal touch and recommended dinner
we tried both the cheese and garlic bread
and my friend had chicken_makhani
the vindaloo melted in my mouth and the makhani sauce was superb over rice
incredible place to have my first time eating indian food
came for dinner and had both the garlic_naan and the cheese_naan
both were amazing and moist
fresh out of the oven
had also chicken_makhani and chicken_vindaloo
the chicken_makhani was sweet to the taste and saucy
the chicken_vindaloo was mild but just the right kind of spicy kick for me
both sauce is great for dipping the naan
i highly_recommend this restaurant
i drove all away from utah to have their chicken_tikka_masala with garlic_naan
incredible
best combination of spices i have ever tasted
not only was the food amazing but the service was incomparable
i will be making the trip just for this restaurant
you won't be sorry
i'm no indian food expert but you can stamp my indian food non expert seal of approval for mount_everest
it is an all_you_can_eat indian buffet with all sorts of indian dishes for just
believe me when this very reasonable_price of
is worth way more than the price you pay
each time i've been here for lunch it's been packed with people spilling out while waiting for tables to free up
there's even not a lot of parking
most of the time these are good signs of how delicious a place is and this was the case here
is it authentic indian
i wouldn't know but a few of my vo workers from india like them too
though i haven't seen others from india dine here at the same time as me
i never asked what a dish was or what's inside so all i can say is that i enjoyed them all
the green stuff
the orange stuff
the yellow and brown stuff
the stuffed bread stuff
and the fried battered stuff
all very delicious
they were labeled but i don't remember what each was because i usually sample them all
there was a red chicken
not to be mistaken for char sui
and another meat dish
ask for the garlic_naan
the freshest right out of the oven
the better
they do have non buffet options
it use to be a burger_king so imagine that kind of space on the inside and they have a tv playing films from india
customer_service is usually fast and friendly so the only reason that i think there's a long wait is because they are very good and those there first are enjoying the goods
worth_the_trip off the strip
the curries here are so good
my_only_complaint is that i wish the free naan that they give with the buffet was garlic_naan instead of plain
but the plain_naan was delicious too
i will be sure to come back during my next trip_to_vegas
i went here seeing
stars at yelp
this restaurant is not even star
food is terrible service is worst
they offer only plain_naan
neither rotis nor garlic_naan
appetizers samosas pakoras were not fresh
must be previous days left_overs
do yourself a favor and go to mint for a satisfying indian buffet
tried this last_night
found on yelp and have to agree with reviews
great food service was wonderful and very well priced
how you could buy a burger when this place is around
this is a place my wife and i keep going back to
such great food and the people are very nice
a usual place of mine
this place serves great food
we highly_recommend coming here during their lunch hour for the buffet so that you can try a variety of food and save a lot of money
what i did find rather funny and unusual was a conversation i had with the waiter
i asked for garlic butter naan and the way he answered the question and what he said was really weird
it wasn't until after my boyfriend and i left that i laughed about it
he said they weren't making garlic_naan because if they did
people would come to their restaurant and it'll be too busy
haha isn't that what you want
then he kept going and said
we're going to continue serving it after the holidays
and we don't have it because it takes too long to make
hahaha i didn't understand all the excuses
so i just said
it's all right
not a big_deal
although i was a little disappointed they didn't have the garlic butter naan because i always order it when i go to an indian restaurant
had a craving_for_indian_food and mount_everest was recommended by my cab driver
started_off_with a chicken_tikka plate that came out looking great because it was sizzling but after a closer inspection
i noticed it was doused in red color dye and no marination or flavor
i then had some butter_chicken which had too much spice and not enough flavor
i did enjoy the naan_bread however which was fluffy and soft
needless_to_say i did not take the leftovers
the tandoori_chicken
yellow curry and naan is great
i'll be back
girlfriend brought me here at
just minutes before they close the buffet
normally i would never go to a buffet right before they close because of the poor food choices that are left but this is not the case
all the food was still being replaced and hot and ready
the chicken curry and sweet_rice were especially delicious
price is cheap too
only
for a indian buffet for kings
yes please
will definitely recommend to friends and return for more
decent food
better than most indian_restaurants in vegas
service is ok
food isn't oily
i don't why this hotel is rated high
it's a pathetic restaurant
actually i am right now in the restaurant
they have a buffet lunch
once i took the curries i was told i will get the naan but i had to wait mins until i went and ask for it again
atmosphere sucks
i would better have gone to some gas station and got pringles
lunch buffet was fabulous
a good number and variety_of_dishes to choose from
friendly_and_attentive staff as well
must try if you like indian
superb
this food was so full of flavor and the owner and his son were wonderful hosts
we were in vegas for my birthday and i was craving_indian_food so i looked on yelp and found mount_everest
when we first arrived we were greeted with a smile and seated_right_away
just by reading the menu we knew we were in for an amazing food experience
we ordered somosa
chicken_tikka_masala
and tandori_chicken
the food was absolutely outstanding
the spices and flavors were a little spicy but too good to not eat
since we left vegas i have been craving the same experience but have not been able to find something remotely close
literally
the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
i went to this restaurant after checking out yelp and i am pleasantly_surprised
they have great food and the owner was really friendly
since we came in on new year's day
he gave the ladies in our party roses
which was so nice
the green chutney was spicy and delicious
garlic_naan was also delicious
best ones i've ever tasted
i would_definitely_come_back when i'm back in town
great ayce indian food for the price and i will_be_going_back soon
there was a constant stream of people coming in for the lunch buffet so you may have to plan ahead if you don't have a lot of time
for a small buffet it had a great mix of sweet
savory
and spicy flavors
everyone in my group left satisfied
absolutely_amazing food
great service
better than a lot of the curry_houses in town
the place is clean and the staff is friendly
i watched a woman hand dry the dishes after they were washed one by one
it shows they care
please visit and enjoy
i'm very picky when it comes to food from my culture
especially in vegas because there are so few options for good indian food
my first time here
and in between my nd and rd plate
i have to say it has hit_the_spot
all the food is extremely flavorful and hits every part of palette
the curry chicken
tandoori_chicken and butter_chicken with the butter naan are delicious
squeeze a little lemon and your good to go
the service is good and everyone is very friendly
i will_be_coming_back here for the lunch buffet and this place has instantly become my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in town
this is a review for the lunch buffet
i have not been there for dinner
wow
i was a little surprised
i had heard so many good things
perhaps this was just an
off
day for their_lunch_buffet
let me explain that we were not treated badly
we were just ignored for the most part
i tried almost everything on the buffet and i enjoy eating indian food and was looking_forward to lunch here since the day before since i had never been
that said
i have been to several different indian places here in town and after reading other reviews i didn't know exactly what to expect
the service was barely there and the lunch buffet
about an_hour and a half into service
was messy
the steam table was occasionally being
refilled
instead of changed out
at least
theoretically
the food that was there at the beginning would only last till the end of the lunch hours
there were a few other cleanliness issues but i'll leave it at that
the tap water served in the cloudy glass could not be overlooked
the items on the lunch buffet itself
some overcooked
were just okay at best
other items bear only slight resemblance to the preparations i've had at other_indian_places
i really do enjoy indian food and i really went into this wanting to like this place
there are a lot of indian_lunch_buffets in las_vegas and if you have the means to go to a different one
sigh
go
phenomenal service
extraordinary food
and a spot in las_vegas that no one knows about
i bring my asian
white
and hispanic friends here all the time
and every time
they are amazed by this culture
any restaurant that can impress all cultures is an extremely rare thing
three key elements
food
reason being is because the food here is diverse and encompasses all common aspects of indian food
unfortunately
most places offer one or two specialities
and the rest is bland
ever dish at mt
everest is a speciality because i can't find any other place with better food
no grease
no fuss
and lots of variety
for under for a lunch buffet
their fresh baked bread i could eat all by itself
service
the owner himself
pradesh
was walking around to greet
and serve the customers
any owner that is willing to clean and pick_up dishes
is a phenominal manager in my name
and i have worked in food industry as a floor manager for years
extremely friendly
and sincere
two things that are rare in this world
authenticity
my best friend is very native to india and a wealthy person
he chooses this place over fine_dining restaurants every time he visits me
there's nothing more to say
this place is the only indian restaurant that will sincerely and fully impress you
charles
love the food and personnel at this restaurant
they always make it as hot as i want it this is
in my opinion the best indian_restaurant_in_vegas
i wish it was closer to our home so we could go more often
fabulous food
friendly_staff and no gimmicks
this place is by_far_the_best_indian in vegas
choose how hot you want your food with being the hottest on the scale
hubby loves the jalfrezi at but we have a tikka at
coming from the uk we are used to great indian food
mount_everest does not disappoint
come here very often
good service
good food
at good price
i like shahi_paneer and mutter_paneer
we were out of towners in vegas for new years who were craving_indian_food
we decided to go to mt
everest and my gosh
we absolutely loved it
the buffet had great vegetarian and meat selections
every dish in the buffet tasted different than the last one and had so much flavor
i am indian
so i know my indian food
this place really reminded_me_of home_cooked food
the owner and the servers were really attentive and made sure we always had naan and water on our table
they cleared out plates as soon as we were done
because it was new years
the owner came and gave me and my friend a rose stem each and wished us a happy new year
it was a great gesture
and no he wasn't hitting on us
we were there with our husbands
he was genuinely a really nice person and they get an a in food as well as customer_service
excellent food and service with a big smile
i had the vegetable thali
what a great way to sample the wonderful food here
i highly_recommend
they also offer a nice beverage selection including wine
go and enjoy
i was wondering if part of my less than
a ok
experience was the result of dining alone
i often find that single diners don't get the same quality of service as larger parties i've always thought that this is due to the lower expected tip who knows
in this case i ordered an appetizer
soup
and main_course
but the soup came out first and while i was about spoonfulls into the soup
the appetizer and main_course arrived
of course
by the time i got to the main_course it was cold
when the manager visited the table to ask me how things were
i told_him how the food had been served and his response was to smile and walk away
otherwise
the service_was_prompt and pleasant
i had lamb filled samosa for appetizer which was overcooked and the meat dried_out
the dahl
lentil soup
was watery and tasteless
and the dish of lamb_curry had about small chunks of meat hidden in a lot of sauce
for extra i got about tablespoons of chutney and another for an equal amount of spiced pickles
the best part of the dinner was the onion stuffed naan
mount_everest could be mistaken
both inside and out
for a fast_food_joint
except for the white cloth napkins and tablecloths
again
if stars means a ok
then this place should be stars for just ok
amazing food and the service outstanding
they owner even provided us free dessert and called us a cab to get back to the hotel
by the time we finished our dessert the cab was ready for us outside
my girlfriend and my year_old mom from italy loved it
thank you for a great meal
a charming restaurant that was easy to get to
and a lovely experience for the whole family
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
tandoori grill and chicken curry are amazing
this restaurant is a gem
wow
best indian food by far
everything tastes good and fresh
from the main_courses to the soups
its a bit heavy but you must order a naan_bread when you are there
it complements the meal very well
food was ok
probably won't be back
nothing special
mint_indian_bistro is better
i was pleasantly_surprised
the location is a bit ghetto so i wasn't expecting the great food and service
the dinner was seasoned and cooked just right
next time i'll try the lunch buffet
this place is just okay
there are many rave reviews
and i feel like i may be missing something
i will give it another shot if i am in the area
but i don't see myself driving out of the way to eat here
their buffet is fairly limited and most of the food lacked any spice factor
it was almost bland and some of it was overcooked
my favorite part was the rice and the naan
i did finish my small plate and had no desire for seconds
the meats were fatty and low quality and the buffet was not exactly cheap at
tip
the owner seems like a nice gentleman and recognized my friend who worships this place
the service however was close to non existent and toward the end we felt rushed
i am a fan_of_indian_food and have sampled several places around town
and this would probably stack somewhere in the middle
i would be interested in trying their dinner items to see how they stack up in that category
overall
just an okay indian buffet with not much separating it from the rest of the pack other than the owner who seems to care about his return patrons
my craving_for_indian_food comes once in a blue moon
and finally that blue moon was shining so bright
nah
just kidding
but as far as i can remember
the last times we've had indian food was the cmyes at namaste and mint
walking to india_masala after helping set up for the first nerdy dancing and most recently
apps at mantra_masala which was okay
this called for a visit that was long overdue
so we scrolled down the list and picked the highest rated place in town which was mt
everest
at
for a lunch buffet of a pretty good spread that would please just about any palate
basmati and sweet_rice
jhukuni aloo
vegetable_samosas
punjabi kadi
palak_paneer
mattar_paneer
gajar halwa
chicken curry
goat_curry
chili_chicken
chicken_makhani
tandoori_chicken
salad_bar
assorted chutneys
naan
and rice_pudding
i tried every offering once
then went back for seconds and thirds of my favorites
the sweet_rice
goat_curry
punjabi kadi
and both paneer dishes
honestly one of the best lunch deals in town
service was great
water glasses and our naan basket was replenished quickly
and you can watch and listen to some bollywood action while enjoying your meal
looking_forward to returning
and this time
no need to wait for that blue moon

yelp challenge
bomb bites and bollywood beats
we decided_to_give it a try for my friends birthday after reading lots of positive_reviews here on yelp
and upon arrival we_were_seated_immediately
everyone else's food smelled so good when we first walked in
i was really excited
even though i don't typically care for indian food
we ordered a bottle_of_wine and a few various dinners and naan
which we did wait a little while to actually receive
but it was so worth_the_wait
everything was amazing
i had the chicken_tikka_masala
which i would surely order again
the owner was also there making sure that everything was perfect
he even brought my friend out dessert for her birthday
we will definitely make the trip back across town to eat here again
the food here is incredible
i've been probably times now and have never been disappointed
the customer_service is great
and makes the meals all the better
i'll be back as often as i can
the owner
prikash
sp
consistently goes out of his way to make the dining_experience even better
this is the bomb indian food buffet
i eat here at least once every week or two
the food is excellent
always fresh
and the management is very friendly
would definitely suggest this restaurant to anyone who enjoys fine indian food
hands_down the best indian_cuisine in vegas
plakat paneer
spinach home made cheese
brings back incredible memories of indian town in singapore
doesn't get any more authentic than this
and you can beat the
lunch buffet price
great customer_service
i had surgery yesterday and my husband had promised to take me to mt_everest afterwards i was starving
we were running late and i called at
and begged them to place a carry_out order
they close at
they saved the day
and let us pick_up our order right after they closed
great fresh food
with just_the_right_amount_of spice
they will kick it up to however hot you want no problem
of all the indian nepal buffets i've been to
this is the least salty and greasy
the taste
did not suffer in the least
it was
in fact
quite tasty
not a huge selection
but a come backer for sure
the staff was very helpful to ensure that i knew the vegan offerings
and brought me began naan_bread as well
back in vegas again for another short business trip and my coworker and i wanted to try something different
something out of the normal
came across this restaurant on yelp and thought this might be a new experience
i have to say that i loved the atmosphere of this place
great scenery
wanted to try some spices from the east
we ordered the chicken_tiki_masala which i certainly loved along with cheese nans
wow perfect meal for what i was looking for
i only tried indian food once before but it didn't catch my eye like it did this time
might make it a weekly dish if i can find one as good back home
my coworker had lamb which i didn't enjoy as much
but overall great experience
new fan favorite
we have been in las_vegas for about a year and we are slowly adding to our list of favorite ethnic restaurants
this place is tops
the owner greeted us and instantly made a friend in my yr old by giving her a high five
gotta love a place that embraces kids
the service was fantastic and the food was even better than fantastic
we can't_wait_to_go_back
we devoured the chicken_tiki_masala and lamb_curry
and let me not forget the orders of garlic_naan
we left stuffed
yet wanting more
until next time
the best_indian_food_in_vegas without a doubt
the service is superb
love the naan and chicken_makhani
i've been here for dinner about three times
the food takes a while to come out because it's made fresh from scratch
i'm not indian but i have eaten food in many places
bay_area
montreal
calgary
vancouver
london
so cal
australia
and this place ranks up there with the best
lunch buffet may not be so impressive because the menu is
predictable
for those that aren't adventurous
don't evern think about going to bollywood over this place
ever
that place is bad
i guess i should have reviewed it the first time i went about months back as that was a star performance
still was a good buffet but i left thinking
eh
stars
maybe i just wasn't hungry enough today
the tandoori_chicken was just a slight bit dry and we had to wait a bit for the naan to come out
overall a lot of pros
every dish had a unique curry flavor
wasn't the same curry taste in multiple dishes
food was hot and fresh
food quality was good
you'd think you ordered a la_carte
service was excellent
water was always refilled promptly
the guy that gave one star and said they used tap water
not the case today
love that paneer spinach and cheese thing
chili_chicken was good
we were there early enough so that when the cooks brought out the trays
they too took some plates of food from the tray into the back for themselves
for me that means no monkey business in the kitchen
you always assume there's not but i've seen too many episodes of kitchen nightmares
the goat was so so
kinda fatty and lots of bones
was hard_to_find a good piece in the whole tray
for
perhaps that's not enough to cover a lamb substitute and maintain profit
i think what was missing today were my sweet monkey balls that seem to hit the desert spot and some beef korma
my_favorite_dish
i think they had it last time
despite this not being as good as i first remembered
it's still the best indian buffet i've tried
been to about
overall a good spread and i will be back
call it
stars
really nice selection for a veggie lover like me
loved their buffet
went back again
and will do so again next time
great food
great service
crappy neighborhood
but that's vegas
my favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
their food is very authentic
always fresh
as it is a popular lunch spot
each time i go they offer a couple different items but still keep some familiar favorites
so it's hard to get tired of going to mount_everest
their staff is quick to clear your table during the lunch buffet
but if you're planning to go between and
be prepared to wait a little bit because they get busy
their tamarind_sauce is the best
definitely my favorite indian place in town
my wife and i eat here regularly
and it never fails to be amazing
the owner is super_nice too
he remembers us and the fact that my wife loooooves super spicy food
i'm more of a mild food kinda guy
and they do that really well too
not that the lunch buffet is mild
it's really good if that's what you want
but stick with dinner if you want super spicy
also
if you ask nicely
they have an amazing jalape o hot paste that you can add to your food
i don't always eat indian
but when i do i prefer mt
everest las_vegas
after eating at mt
everest
it's all downhill
ha ha get it
that's right my friend
you will never have it as good
so far i have only been here for the lunch buffet
here at_least_once_a_week
sometimes twice
my only previous experience eating indian was when i lived in nyc for years
there is probably million indian_restaurants there
one for every cab driver
let_me_tell_you my friend
even the best one there could not compete with mt
everest
i remember the last place i used to eat at
called chola
supposedly it was great
always packed with indians
their food was always greasy and made me feel tired afterwards
probably from chemical
or cheap quality
mt
everest is not like any_other_indian_restaurant you have eaten in
the food is not greasy
the quality of the ingredients is fresh
and of high_quality
i don't know how they do it
every dish at that buffet is a solid ten
i wish they would raise their buffet price to keep all the riff raff like you yelpers out
sadly
this place gets jam packed at lunch
the best part is that a corona is only
i really appreciate it when restaurants don't try to rape customers on liquor prices
actually the food is the best part
wait the best part is the great indian music_videos on tv there
wow
those guys know how to deliver a show
love_this_place
i've been here for dinner as well as the lunch buffet and haven't yet tried something i didn't love
mount_everest is still my
go to
indian spot
despite having tried several others since my first visit
if they delivered
you bet your ass they'd be on their way to my house right now with a big bag of awesome
yes
everything you've heard about the
rough
location is true
but the food makes_up_for_it
it's not a huge place either
so prepare for claustrophobia during the busy times
we love_this_place
travel from henderson to eat here
staff is friendly_and_attentive
food is prepared exceptionally
you can taste the individual flavors in all the dishes
awesome food and service
this place is absolutely_amazing
before i get to the food i want to say how nice the waiter was
i think he was the owner'a son and he was so nice and funny
he just came over and talked to us and wanted to see how our food was and if we were doing okay
and now the food
we ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
chicken jal frezi
and dal tarka with basmati_rice for the main_course
all were very tasty and the chicken was so tender
for dessert we got the sweet balls and the rice_pudding
omg both were soo good
oh and of course the garlic_naan was amazing
i definitely recommend_this_place
a little underwhelmed by the much hyped chicken_tikka_masala
ordered take out
added on the garlic_naan and galub jamon
specified a spice_level of for my 'tikka and order was out in minutes flat
with a large side of basmati_rice
chicken_tikka_masala was a good size for the price tag
which included the rice
garlic_naan was worth the upcharge
delicious
soft
and flavorful
with a garlic scent that wafted through my car as i drove home
my disappointment came when i finally tried my entree
for a spice_level of
i tasted absolutely no spice
and the sauce had a sweetness to it that i am not familiar with
it wasn't necessarily bad
but the dish didn't have the kick to it i was craving
chicken in dish was in large chunks
sauce was a smidge on the thin side
based_on other reviews
i'm going to have to come back for the lunch buffet and reevaluate
some of the best indian food i've had in a while
being new to town
we stumbled upon this place driving around
not much to look at from the outside but the food was very good
we arrived at lunch time so decided the best course of action was the buffet so we got to sample a large variety
of note
the dishes used good quality cuts of meat
no nasty gristle surprised when you chomp down
service is good
and the flavors in the dishes are great
the only negative thing i can come up with is that the naan_bread is a little
bready
for my liking
i'll_definitely_be_back and would recommend it to new and old indian food eaters
i'm beginning to feel like all indian_lunch_buffets are the same
while good
and flavorful
this place was no different
just about all the indian joints i've been to have the same shit
chicken tandoori
saag
lentils
chicken curry
whatever
i think i'm becoming disenchanted with indian_buffets the older i get
great
food
ambiance
personnel
service
just read nelson q
's review
nuff said
i'm coming_back whenever i'm in vegas
best place on earth
my brother had to point out that it was a rather crappy part_of_town
but i didn't notice anything
granted there were a lot of bail bond signs around and title loan locations
but that does not mean it is a bad part_of_town
walking into the place
i was hit in the face with the smells of india
but not like it hit me in the face with a metal bat
more like a large fluffy pillow
we were seated and given our menus
as some of the others on here have said the mixed platter is excellent
the waiter is also very hydrating
i thought i was in delhi while eating
without the monkeys
or the billion people around
it has been almost hours and i am still stuffed
this place has made me rethink about the indian food i get in san diego
i probably will never be the same again
the one chick that works there
that we saw
like a on the hotness scale too
one of the best non vegetarian and vegetarian indian restaurant i been to
take it from someone from who lived in indian for years
your buffet was amazing
best indian buffet in vegas
restaurant is very clean and staff is always very friendly_and_attentive
good selection of items on buffet and they are always hot and fresh
awesome indian lunch buffet
not only is the price great
the food is too
of all the indian places in vegas
this is a frequent stop for me
i am pretty stuffed and satisfied everytime after dining here
the restaurant seems like a family_owned business and the customer_service is wonderful
they are super_nice
friendly
and seem easy to get their attention if you need anything
there's also a tv playing in the corner with current indian movies with plenty of bollywood dancing and hip current indian music
the usual dishes we order are
appetizers
vegetable_pakora and samosas
thinly spiced cracker
don't know the name of it sorry
main_dishes
tandoori_chicken
palak_paneer
chicken_korma
chicken_makhani
lamb_curry
rogan_josh
sides
garlic_naan and rice
the appetizers are very tasty and a good size that come with a mint jutney sauce and a spicier sauce
all the main_dishes are very good also
warning though
if you ask for spicy
these dishes can definately make you sweat like a banshsee
just ask my bf
i like them milder and ask for mild or a level
and they are delish
maybe
or higher will be too spicy and possibly not enjoyable
but up to one's palate
the tandoori_chicken comes out on a sizzling plate and the chicken is so tender and tasty
always a safe bet
the chicken_makhani
butter_chicken
is my absolute favorite
the korma and curry are pretty rich in spices and have very distinct flavors to the dishes
i think the palak_paneer is alright but reminds me more of creamed spinach so maybe a pass
this place is small and cozy but usually hopping with customers
the food may come out a bit slower when they are busy but it's worth_the_wait
always happy with the food and service here that makes me keep_coming_back for my indian food fix
i really need to come for the lunch buffet which looks like a great deal for the same food
had their buffet and it was great
i love indian food
but can't_handle the spiciness of it
and didn't think the buffet was too spicy
so
if you love hot spicy then you may want to order off of the main menu
i'll definitely be trying this place out again soon
went here based_on reviews
probably drove by times but never checked out
it is a great restaurant
good service great food good pricing good selection
definitely will be back
after talking_about indian food with doriee d and andrew c we decided to check_this_place_out the next day for their_lunch_buffet which runs from am to pm daily
i usually like to order_off_the_menu at places like this but for some reason it seems like indian places in vegas prefer to do buffet only for lunch
after seeing a bunch of positive friends' reviews of this place we figured it was a fairly safe and solid choice
given the time we arrived
i'd say the buffet was still fairly full since the lunch buffet ends at pm
however
we never saw it refilled while we were there
on my first plate i tried a little bit of everything which meant i had a pretty full plate to work through
the stand outs were the curry chicken
tandoori_chicken
and chili_chicken
which had a little kick to it
the veggie_samosa and sweet basmati_rice were ok
and are probably an acquired taste
fresh naan was brought to our table and it was warm and delicious
not burnt
old
or cold like some other places
after the first plate i was already pretty full and just got seconds of the chicken dishes i liked
we wanted to try their milky balls p for dessert but they were all gone by the time we were done eating so we had to settle for the sweet rice_pudding instead
which i believe is called kheer
for
for an ayce buffet the food was decent and i would come back the next time i have a craving_for_indian_food
the food was okay
i had malai_kofta and it was too sweet and kofta was hard
the waiter asked how was the food and i told_him exactly how it was
next time i may try different dish
the place was busy
assuming the food must be good but that's not the case
i guess it depends what you order
best indian restaurant
great buffet during lunch hours
can't be beat for the cost
and quality
sauces made slow over hours at a lunch buffet
sign me up
i have to come here at least once or twice a month
hand down man down
worth it
very good food
nice crew
recommend_this_place to everyone who likes indian_cuisine
this place was amazing
my boyfriend and i took his mom there for a late mother's day dinner
he had recently gone to india so she thought trying indian good sounded good
we showed_up and got seated_right_away
very small
quiet place
all the employees were very nice and our server was very helpful with suggestions
there were of us so we just got a bunch of different things to share
this dish i chose was the lamb masala
amazing
very sweet spicy sauce and that lamb was cooked_perfectly
by the end of the meal everyone was so full and the bill was very reasonable
overall great experience and will_definitely_be_back to try the lunch buffet
brilliant buffet super spongy naan
crunchy pakoda and samosa were my favorites
if u r dying for some good indian food
this place will definitely satisfy you
if you're in the mood for some authentic_indian_food spice this is a place to go
the food is absolutely fantastic down to the naan_bread spices are true to scale flavors are on point
the location doesn't_look_like much when you first pull up
in fact might find yourself questioning your choice
but trust_me you will get over it as soon as you try the food
also
this is a very family oriented restaurant
so bring the kids and whoever else in your family tree
b
the staff behaved very bad
if you ask them for
liquor menu
their reply is an arrogant
no
because you asked for a wrong menu
it's called the
beer menu
not liquor
lol
food is average
not something exciting
all my rating is for the samosa and the indian bread
which was always served hot
very good service
even when it was crowded
overall a decent star
really good food
i'm an indian and knows what is a good indian good
friendly and quick service
we ordered spicy food
and loved it
their dessert was average
therefore giving
stars else would have given
awesome food
great taste
but takes a while for them to get you seated
well the fact that i drive half way across town
at rush hour
in heat
should tell you what you need to know
the food and service are very very good
i have tried several indian_restaurants_in_town and mount_everest is by far my favorite
the food is great the prices_are_reasonable
and the service is fast
for dinner the chicken_tikki_masala is amazing
and if_you're_looking for a good fast lunch their_lunch_buffet can't be beat
the chicken_tiki_masala is delicious and the servers were so nice
when we first pulled up we were not so sure because it looks small and old and in an older area but once you got inside it was ok and smelled so good
ask for garlic_naan
best indian_cuisine lunch buffet in town
after wanting_to_try this place on my last couple visits to vegas
i finally made it there on monday
the husband and i literally drove from phoenix straight to mount_everest for the lunch buffet
this buffet was no joke
the food on it was very good
we both felt it was one of the best indian_buffets we had been to
so much so
that i ate a ton of food and couldn't eat another thing for the rest of the day
standout dishes were the chickpea_curry
the sweet_rice
never seen this before
and the warm carrot dessert
so tasty
the chicken_tikka_masala wasn't the best i'd ever had
complaints include
we finished a full plate of food before getting the opportunity to ask for naan
they didn't bring any to us
our booth was in a weird corner you had to squeeze into
and their women's bathroom wasn't super clean
although i imagine that was from a recent customer and not due to a general lack of cleanliness
i would recommend_this_place to locals for sure
this is typical family_run indian place
just off the strip
very enthusiastic guys and service is great
food is also nice
decor could_have_been_better but the guys friendly disposition makes for it
the food is fresh and portion_size is great
since my favorite indian_joint was shut down due to health code violations
come on
what are a few cockroaches when the food is amazing
i decided_to_give this place a shot
i really liked it
my date and i split the mt
everest dinner which had a little bit of everything and it was delish
it was also more than enough food for the two of us
we also added an order of garlic_naan and it was so tasty
my only complaints are
the paleek paneer only had one small chunk of paneer
and the service was pretty impersonal
the prices were pretty average
and the location is not the best but i do love a good hole_in_the_wall from time to time
will i go here again
yep
i'd love to
will i keep hunting for the a new go to for indian food
yeah
this place was great but isn't quite as good as some other places i've been to
for a lunch buffet
it's good quality and choices
they have some exotic choices such as goat
along with the classic indian dishes such as curry
saag
the best dish
and paneer
it comes with an order of naan_bread
all of this for just above is an awesome deal
i ordered the mango_lassi and it was too sweet
that's probably the only real compliant
service is quick and friendly and easy_to_find
parking is abundant
i relied on yelp_reviews and made a trip to this place all the way from las_vegas strip
it's not that far
it took me just mins by cab
i came in for lunch buffet and i didn't like what i saw so i asked if i can order ala_carte but sadly that don't allow that
i arrive bit early and the food labels on the buffet were wrong
samosa was good and so was the naan but rest of the stuff was disappointing
i would not recommend_this_place_to_anyone
one of the best indian buffet yet
excellent food selection and display
samosas and chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori_chicken
sweet_rice
lentil
chutney
naan are stars
and try chai_tea too
for
this is an amazing spread
restaurants clean
definitely made it onto my fav lunch spot list
visiting from nj where there is a large indian population
i can say this was a great find in lv
the flavors here are not quite as bold and cater towards more of an american crowd
but everything was delicious
we shared the mt_everest combination meal which was a great deal and had a good amount of food
would recommend to anyone looking for their curry fix
very tasty
reasonably_priced indian food
especially considering the cost at some of the other restaurants and resorts in vegas
we made the drive from henderson and it was worth it chicken_tikka_masala and lamb_korma were both tasty
but had kick
i had to order a mango_lassi to quench the fire
attentive staff and easy parking just be aware it might feel a little sketchy in that area
but we had no problems
get the garlic_naan
too
i am surprised mt_everest has a higher rating than mint because it is not even close to the same quality
when i pulled up i was surprised to see a drive thru but then i realized it was closed and the employees were using it to park their cars
upon walking into the restaurant
i noticed the buffet in the back corner looking sad and unsanitary
i sat_down and shortly_after we were brought out the papadum and were asked what we wanted to order
the papadum and sauces just weren't good and to top things off the basket it was in was not cleaned
i shouldn't have overlooked this but i did because i was craving_indian_food
i ordered two mango lassi's
garlic_naan
malai_kofta
chicken_makhani their speciality
and basmati_rice
the mango lassi's were brought out instantly
this one was not made well
was overly sweet
tasted artificial
and was not thick enough
i was able to stomach mine but my dining partner wanted to send hers back
i asked the asian man if we could send it back and he giggled and said no
then our indian waiter comes over laughs and says mango lassi's our supposed_to_be sweet and i said i know i have had my a mango_lassi before but but this overly sweet
he begrudgingly took it back
our entrees come and the portions are huge
both of the curries had that artificial taste and reminded_me_of curry at a food_court
the chicken in the chicken_makhani was dry and the fat was not trimmed off properly
the veggie balls in the malai_kofta were extremely hard on the outside and not very moist on the inside
the garlic_naan was tasty but once again it was brought out in a basket that was not clean
the indian food here is mediocre and i question how well things are cleaned
we really enjoyed the food
great flavor throughout the meal
the chicken dishes were moist fork cut
and the lamb we had was well prepared
this is a little gem of an indian_joint
best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
their butter_chicken is soooooo delicious
to die for
the owner is so friendly and very professional
i always recommended people to go there when they are craving_indian_food even when i help my guests visiting me at the spa where i work
one of the best restaurants_in_vegas
great service
the food was served within a few minutes of ordering
taste was really good and the quantity was good too
would_definitely_go_back again
we eat indian food a lot and are quite particular
i am pleased to say that this restaurant exceeded my expectations in all respects
i like that the owner and his family work together and are very service oriented
of course the food is why we would go and
again
it exceeded our expectations
clearly
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
the chicken_tikka_masala was excellent as was the lamb_vindaloo
big menu making it hard to choose and i found myself looking at all the great dishes coming out if the kitchen
try and get there early to get a booth as it looks much more comfortable than a regular table
highly_recommended and we will be back soon with our friends
yes
yes
yes
my wife and i took a little bus ride over here on one of our annual trips to vegas
honeymoon this time yay
and man was it worth it
we love indian_buffets
but in the midwest the quality level can vary quite a bit
mount_everest hits it out of the park
price was incredibly reasonable
they had just about every indian_food_i've_ever_had available
and the taste was sublime
mouth_watering delicious
the staff was polite and friendly too
the bus ride was very reasonable
we bought a deuce bus hr pass
which was also good for the city bus
so we were able to hop one from the strip over to there
its a pretty quick ride and the neighborhood seemed fine
i've snagged the duece pass each time i've been in vegas and despite being slow at times its one of the best ways to save money when out on the town
if you are an indian buffet lover
this is my favorite of all the ones i've had
so definitely make the time and give it a stop
hands_down the best indian food we've had and that is saying something
excellent vegetarian_options and they made two perfectly executed custom vegan dishes for my husband
customer_service was beyond expectations
nice relaxed atmosphere
and located off the strip so great prices for lots of amazing food
we will definitely be making a trip back
had dinner here on a friday_night
food was very good and service was friendly if a little scattered
they just opened this week so i am sure the service will get better
recommend checking them out
saag_paneer was great and the naan was also good
being indian and having eaten at many of the best indian_restaurants in the valley
i'm not your usual casual diner who knows nothing about indian food
i usually eat dosa and south_indian fare at woodlands
ray and rural
i tried cafe_krishna for a change
i was disappointed
the service was lousy
the waitstaff was not rude and in fact they were very friendly but the wait was too long
we ordered an appetizer and two dosas
they took a minutes to bring us our appetizer and another minutes
hour
before we got our dosa
it was not busy when we ordered
there were only couples in the restaurant at the time and they had waiters
they never checked on us and we had to flag them down to get our bill
one of the waiters is an eastern european woman who spoke no english and had never waited tables before
she brought our chaat to our table and didn't even bring plates with it
the food itself was good but not noteworthy
their chutneys were not tasty or flavorful
the coconut_chutney at woodlands is a lot better
the dosa had very little sabji
potato
filling and was nearly entirely just one large crepe
the dosa at woodlands includes much more sabji
i did like the sabji and thought it was better than woodlands because it was slightly less greasy
the samosa_chaat was not good
it had very little samosa
maybe two small pieces of one samosa
and the rest of it included vegetables
it wasn't bad but neither was it tasty
the only positive aspect to the place was it's ambience
despite its
cafe
name
the place is a sit_down restaurant
it's nicer than many full fledged indian_restaurants in the valley
it was clean
spacious with many booths
and decorated well
you are seated
given a menu and a waiter takes your order
it's not like woodlands in which you order at the register
it has a full menu but it's vegetarian
it's also a south_indian place so i wouldn't recommend ordering saag_paneer and north_indian dishes because south indians don't know how to cook north_indian food
i will not come back because the service was too slow
even when we flagged our waiter for our bill
there was another couple who had sat for minutes and had not even had their drink_orders taken
honestly
why would i wait an_hour to eat dosa when i can go up the street and eat at woodlands and get the same quality dosa in minutes
i'm pretty forgiving of slow service if the restaurant is super busy or if there is only one server but this was different
you could tell the waiters had no previous experience waiting tables and had no sense of urgency
they didn't know how to refill drinks
check up on you
bring your bill to you on time
it seemed like they were related to the owner or were part owners and tried to be servers
if the restaurant improved their speed and service
i would recommend_this_place
hopefully that will improve
scale of
multiple visits
food
service
atmosphere
value
the service is very friendly
the food is very good an excellent coconut_chutney and their combo meals are well priced and offer up a good variety
scale of
food good authentic vegetarian fare plus some unusual breads
service very friendly but rather slow
atmosphere clean
but i always prefer indian_restaurants a little dimmer
value
they are still a little new and hopefully trying to improve the speed of the service
the quality of the food makes for somewhat haphazard service
if you go in expecting somewhat slightly slow service and are not in a rush you will certainly enjoy this restaurant
update have been going to this restaurant regularly for at least the last months
overall have become even more impressed by the variety and selection of dishes
also service has improved with time
i think i have to place this at the top of my favorite restaurants
even above the delhi palace which has been our favorite for the last years
highly_recommended
this review pertains to the lunch buffet only
i would expect a different experience at dinner
first off
the service was very
self serve
which is what one would expect from a buffet
but there are no self serve stations for water or tea refills
and the wait_staff seldom made an appearance
the food was good
but i am not a fan of most buffets
my friend informed me that the food was much better at dinner
and i intend on finding out sometime
i enjoy good indian food every once in awhile and cafe_krishna was a great place to indulge
i like that its all vegetarian and the choices are abundant
the food was great
i just wish the service was a little better
it was a little bit slow and inconsistent
i definitely recommend trying one of their dosai and a curry both are delicious
i had never had dosai until this place opened
every version i've tried is yummy
the accompanying sauces
however
can be a little too heavy and spicy for me
it sounds to me that their_lunch_buffet is the problem but other wise cafe_krishna is a great place for vegetarian fare from india
their food is mainly south_indian such as dosas
chutneys etc
we have eaten dessert here at night time and our impression was great
not only of the gulab jamuns
rass malai and the mango kulfi that we ate but also of the service and their overall setup
this is a clean south_indian eatery unlike the udupi place in tempe
go here
you will like
the facility was a clean environment for food and there was a good variety on the menu
i was there for the dinner meal
i was thoroughly unhappy with the service that was received here during dinner on a saturday_night
first the servers were not able to figure_out how to set up a table that was correct for the size of the party that was attending
next the server was very unorganized giving us items that we did not order and forgetting items that were ordered
when brought to his attention the server went back to the kitchen without offering an apology
he then proceded to bring the same dish as he had brought out before that was an incorrect item and did not bring out items that were ordered
at this point this was pointed_out to him again he went back in only to come out minutes_later after most of the party had finished_eating with the items that he had forgotten to bring out
the waiter made excuses for what happened and did not apologize nor offer any compensatory changes to the bill due to his mistakes
after the desert was ordered this too was below expectations
the waiter seemed disinterested in how we felt about the food and our overall satisfaction at dinner
waiter was disinterested
disorganized
and unapologetic
overall avoid this restaurant
this is new hotness out of phoenix
they offer flavorful food on lunch_buffets
and it seems to be
i
pulling a lot of people out of their houses to come and enjoy the food
ii
taking away buisness from other indian joints
weekend
friday lunch buffet through sunday dinner
food quality has been great and consistent
most items have their unique flavors and textures
weekday dinners quality is not consistent
service is generally sloppy
they have not figured out the co ordinate system of the place they own
what is table x and where is that
how many of people y are sitting on that table x and what each of the person ordered and in what order
i believed they found themselves unprepared to the high clientele they attracted based_on the quality of the food
quality of food however easily over rides this sightly negative aspect which is already improving
and the sloppiness offers something additional for us to chuckle about at the table
the other thing i rate food joints on is whether the food feels too filling in one or two round
its better than most other places in the valley
north_indian appetizers are not great
have not sampled dessert menu enough to write about it
its all vegetarian
suits me i am a vegetarian
two words inconsistent indifferent
awesome indian food
nice buffet
mint rice is unique
dosa
that was the main reason we came to this place
i had a combo
that gave me the chance to try dosa and more other things
good service
nice place and friendly attention
now a five_star
i had to go back and update my review for cafe krisha
as i have made several more visits since my original posting
cafe krisha has been open for a while and has still failed to supply guests with a menu that marks what items are suitable for vegans
at vegetarian restaurants
a menu that marks what is vegan is not just a convenience
it is a standard
cafe_krishna stands virtually alone in the phoenix as the only vegetarian restaurant that fails to offer this
this wouldn't be an issue if servers were more willing to ensure that products were dairy free
getting a confirmation that a menu_items are dairy free from the servers feels like pulling teeth
and i making people's lives more difficult makes me feel uncomfortable
i just want to sit_down and eat with no worries
a simple
v
next to all the vegan items would make me feel more inclined to eat at cafe_krishna
it would make me feel more certain about what i was eating
and it would make the lives for the servers easier not having to run back and forth the kitchen every time i
and every other vegan
have a question about dairy in my food
that aside
the food at krishna can be quite good
i've had crispy
spicy gobi_manchurian here and i've had mild
crumbly gobi_manchurian
the rasam and sambar is always good
and the dosas are usually a pretty safe bet
i had my first experience with uttapam here
and it was quite good but i'll be sure to ask for no raita next time
so
cafe_krishna
mark the vegan items
and work on a little consistency and you could easily outscore any other indian join in town
om nom nom
they had me at
authentic indian veg
but it's really quite exceptional
we both had the lunch buffet
which has quite few main_dishes and desserts
it is comparable to lunch_buffets i've really enjoyed in the bay_area or manhattan
both in terms of quality and variety
and very reasonably_priced at
the buffet includes a dosa and i think also a drink
i had the tofu manchurian
a nice chana dish i haven't had before
not chana_masala
plain rice
there are several other choices for rice
an okra dish
some nice fresh salad
and some ieee naf on the side
the masala tea came unsweetened
which is how i prefer it
the kheer was quite tasty
and that's just scratching the surface
if i lived in chandler i'd want to eat here every day
heck
if i still lived in tucson i'd be tempted to go there for lunch once in a while as it is
i'll_definitely_be_back next time i'm passing through at lunch time
by the way
some reviews have said things about the food being cold
i didn't have that experience it was all the right temperature for me
andrea and i arrived before noon
so kind of on the early side
i found the service to be prompt and friendly
i have been here twice for the past couple_of_weeks and i must say the food and service is vastly improved
buffet was excellent and service was respectful
am thinking twice in a row cannot be a fluke
keep it up krishna cafe
thank goodness for living_social
or i might never have discovered_this_place
as a vegetarian
this was my hog heaven
minus the hog
i mean
i could literally order anything i wanted and would be sure that there wasn't an accidental chicken stock action
or that pork might show up towards the bottom of the bowl
i also really really loved that they offer both northern and southern options dosas and curries
i went on a saturday_night with my partner and a friend
for
we got starters
a dosa combo plate
a thali
iced_tea and a mango_lassi
and we took home dosas
naan
and a few other things
great pricing and lots of food for your buck
most of the food was absolutely_amazing
although i found it to be heavy on the onions
not a huge fan
and some of it to be too spicy
as far as the negative
the service was awful
when someone came by
they were super friendly
all times through out the meal
it took us two hours to order
eat and pay
waiting for the check took almost minutes on its own
my partner's iced_tea was empty for the majority of the meal
also
not an issue for us
but the vegan items weren't marked
which would have been a problem if any one was vegan
the food and pricing gets stars
the service gets
overall
a
and i'll have to go back for the buffet at some point
when i get to provide my own service
i really enjoyed this place
was pleasantly_surprised the quality of food
more than anything
i was amazed how full i was on a vegetarian menu
highly_recommended for new experiences
as_good_as_it_gets for south_indian food here
indian authentic would of course be much better
food is awesome
fresh_ingredients
cool variety of chutneys love their combos
on menu
that way you can taste a bit of everything
also dig their mini idly
rice flour balls
medu vada
paysam for dessert and ofcourse the rava masala or just the masala_dosa
delish
the service can be a bit slow and mainly because it gets busy towards peak hours and doesn't have way too many servers but for me its' worth_the_wait
at this place
check it out
i can hardly tell my paneer's from my gobi's but i can tell you that i like this place
walk in and you will find a modern contempray dinning room with granite top tables
booths and tables
in back is the buffet setup
we were in for lunch at
on a saturday and the buffet was the only option
and what a good option it was
so many flavorful dishes and all veg
i tried them all then tried many a second and third time
we were offered dosas
a indian crepe like item
i don't know if this cost us extra but it was good and with dosa's the buffet was
the dishes had pretty good flavor
some flavors did not pop as much as i would have liked but overall the selection and quality won me over
the buffet is nice as i am still mostly lost on what to order when looking at an indian food menu
we had water with our meal
they give you glasses and a carafe of water but oddly no ice
if you are veg go here and just keep eating
if you are not
you may not even notice that the place is meat free
i've always had some difficulty finding good indian food in the valley
cafe_krishna was a refreshing change from the sub par establishments that i have become accustomed to
the food was quite good and more than compensated for the slightly innocuous atmosphere
the
combos
offer a lot of food at a very affordable price and may prove to be perfect for someone trying indian faire for the first time
vegetarian
or not
i feel confident that you will enjoy cafe_krishna
the combos were very good and at a good price
i liked the food at woodlands a bit better but the atmosphere here was a little less take out then there
will_be_going_back
i visit this place very often for the lunch buffet
there is a wide_variety of veg and vegan dishes in both north and south_indian_cuisine
to start with there is salad
veg fritters and chaat
north_indian snack
the main_course has naan
bread
different gravies
a rice dish
gravies to eat with plain rice and a curry
you get a choice of dosa
crepe
between plain and stuffed which are both equally good
there is also a desert and a fruit to finish the meal
sometimes the service is very slow and the waitresses do not clear the plates and take time to bring the check
but overall very yummy and satisfying food
not just vegetarian folks
but even meat_eaters like this place from what i have seen
definitely a must visit
went here with an indian friend so i can't tell you what i ate
but it was tasty
we went
pm on a thursday and it was pretty empty
but as the night progressed more and more people filled the place out
they do have a lunchtime buffet but not sure the price or quality of food
but if it's anything like the dinner we had
its worth checking out
we have eaten here a few more times and each time we have been
we have liked this place more
we mostly go for dinner
the masala in the dosa is very bland and not enough
the sambhar could be a tad more spicy
but
overall we like this place
he loved the gobi_manchurian that they serve there and the naans were awesome
better than any north_indian restaurant naans that we have eaten and mind you this is a south_indian restaurant
my vegetarian and vegan friends love_this_place
i thought this place was fantastic
food is very fresh and tasty
not greasy at all
which made for no indigestion afterward
that is so rare with indian food
i usually feel weird afterward from the grease and spice
their_lunch_buffet is very very good
we want to come back for dinner and try mutter_paneer
my fave
i work near here and have never gone in
today at lunch
a g f and i went there and it was really good
great south_indian food and a nice clean atmosphere
at lunch
they have a nice buffet with wonderful vegetarian selections for
you_can't_beat that
order
and along with a mango drink split it with a friend or two and you will all be fat and happy when you leave
have been here several times now
and hands_down the best indian food i've ever tasted
love it and go back at least twice a month
it's awesome for pure vegetarians
it took a lot to convince my husband to go so far to an indian restaurant
when there are one's closer to home
but now
even he is a fan
the food tastes like home made
the service is good and seating comfortable
no garish decor either
water is brought right away and they even keep a carafe of it at your table so no need to wait for eye contact with a waiter waitress to quench your thirst
almost all the entree's on the buffet were good
not too spicy but tasty
dessert was good
they had kheer made with tapioca balls rather than rice
my daughter would have liked to have gulab jamoon
the vadaas were soft on the inside and crisp on the outside as they should be
now for some comparison with udupi
which is the other south_indian restaurant i have been to around here
sambar not as good as udupi
masala dosas not as big i liked them but my family likes the udupi masala dosas
they did not have idlis
now that was a surprise
but overall
i would recommend_this_place
it also looked clean
on a dinner break from work
my lovely significant other and i thought this place sounded so much more interesting than the other nearby options
and there had been some recent positive lunchroom chatter about cafe_krishna
i really wish we had more time to linger
but that will be the next visit
i ordered kadai bhindi_masala
the okra was so tender and the spices were just right
left me wanting for more
beside me was a delicious curry
the naan was ample and fresh
this food was excellent and the variety more extensive than most indian_restaurants i have visited
but i must compliment the excellent service and attention given to a special dietary request
the staff went above and beyond our reasonable expectations
we were so pleased with their care to get it just right
i recommend cafe_krishna to anyone who loves spices beyond salt and pepper
and is willing to forget that it is vegetarian
too
it is well worth a little drive
and i am really happy to find it close to my job
been here at least a dozen times
gobi_manchurian is exceptional and the buffet usually is too
unfortunately i haven't been back in months as we went for lunch and the selection was terrible
items
i asked what was up and they said their gas was out all morning and they couldn't cook
when i got the check they asked how was everything and i told them terrible as we were literally going to have to leave and go somewhere_else for lunch and they said sorry about that it won't happen again but proceeded to charge us full price
so disappointing we were regulars but that did it for us
i am sure it was a one off issue so don't not go there because of my review we miss it
but paying full price to get a mouthful of there food
put a bad taste in our mouth figuratively of course
the food is above_average
not the best
but certainly enjoyable
the service is quite hit_or_miss
more
miss
than
hit
i'm pretty apathetic about this place
i have a friend who lives right down the street and we enjoy going here and being left alone to chat
but it's not something i'd seek out
what is nice
if it matters to you
is the atmosphere
it's quite sterile and borning
which makes sense considering it's in a strip_mall in chandler
but there are plenty of good indian places that are in dive environs
so a sterile
suburban feeling place is a nice upgrade at times
hi
i am a south_indian and this place is awful
they serve too slow and food is bad
price is ok but you can get better food at the same price
my serious suggestion is not to try this place
have a nice day
thanks
first place that has tempted me to write a review

south_indian vegetarian food we went for the buffet only time i've felt everything i tried tasted great
visit az just to eat here
we had a really nice dinner here
the staff was super friendly
the food was excellent and the prices were reasonable
our food came out quickly
and the restaurant was clean
the staff answered our questions and were courteous
we had the vege curry
and the curry with okra
we also tried a very cool looking triangular dosai
it was our first time trying dosai and i think it was the best meal of the night
though the others were quite yummy
great buffet
one dosa per_person is included in the buffet
although if you are a new comer there
no one will tell you
you have to ask the wait_staff for a dosa
the staff was attentive and nice
food was great with options for dessert and freshly prepared food was coming in from the kitchen every few hours
the coconut_chutney is great
this was our first time here and we really enjoyed it
there were many things on the menu that we had never tried before and we liked that
we basically asked the staff what they recommended and ordered that
i asked for mine
hot
and it was at the most medium in spice
i have found that people don't usually take me seriously the first time i dine somewhere and request
hot
that was a bummer for sure
but the flavors were great
we had the mini idlies and loved the different chutneys for dipping
we also enjoyed the vegetable pakoda which was done very well here
probably the best i've had
for an entrees
we had the masala_dosa which was really good
very different
to me
as i've not had it before
i had the chole batura which was excellent
the portions are huge and easily made for leftovers and for enough to shared
i will definitely come back to try some different things
the menu is very extensive and prices were really good
vegetarian only buffet
very slow at replenishing their buffet line even though they only had a few dishes
i enjoy coming here for lunch occasionally
i like indian_buffets
unlike chinese buffets
which i abhor
because of the variety of ingredients and dishes i get to sample that i otherwise may not order if it was a la_carte
this place specializes in vegeterian indian food
a very typical thing
and i've had some interesting meal combinations here
lots of legumes
leafy greens
curries
all mixed in with vegetables and occasionally tofu
nothing has really ever stood_out with the food
but it has never been a bad experience
the facilities are another story
i was there recently when they ran out of tp in the lady's bathroom
i actually checked before using thankfully
i alerted the girl that works the front desk and she was completely useless
she said she'd refill it and it never was refilled
when i asked her again
after holding my bladder throughout my meal
she said they were completely out
really
how are you out of tp
who manages inventory for this place
i can only imagine that if someday they were out of hand soap
they'd handle it the same way
which means your cooks could be making your food with dirty hands
grody
if you are a vegetarian
you must eat here
their indian food is amazing
also
i took someone from work here that is really big on beef and always having to have meat
and they still liked this place
you won't even miss the meat
seriously
also their service is the best
eew
a buffet with no meat
o
ok
i knew what i was getting into before driving miles over here because i'm a yelpie
yeah yelp
have you bought any of our newly released stock yet
for
right now you can be yelp
i'm just askin'
sorry i morphed into jim kramer for a moment
back on topic
let's get an actual gripe out of the way
the sambar soup was the first thing i tried
it was lukewarm
there goes a star right off the bat
o
ok
so was there anything good about this place
or is it lower than thiruvananthapuram we call the mover with the glitziest elephant
ur
i mean the best yelp rating
send these_guys packing
pots pans banging
back to bangalore
well maybe
but first let us consider
you get your choice of a table or a booth in this mid sized restaurant
yeah booths
it's a modern
nice place with a peaceful
comfortable air about it due in part to the excellent acoustics
lighting layout
and yes
they were busy
the staff was cheerful
friendly
the table service just right
indian girl
whom unlike the soup was fairly hot
sorry
had them fix me a dosa
the latest foofy food around the valley
in my choice of flavors from a little menu she had with her
mine was tasty
with curried potatoes whatnot inside
there were only about main food items plus sauces dressings
but that seemed like enough
some of my favorites besides the dosa were the sambhar
soup
the mutter_paneer
pongal
biryani rice
the creamy hot help yourself tea
and the gulab janum
monkey balls
for dessert
hare krishna
hare rama
they were so awesome
what a pleasure to eat at this lovely place today with its interesting
different delicious food
his divine grace a
c
bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada would have approved it i think you'll like cafe_krishna too
monday through thursday lunch buffet
been here many times but has always been disappointing
of late the quality is becoming worse
they are just well situated near intel
home of mini india
true they don't serve meat
true the lunch buffet is reasonably_priced and darn good
have eaten here several times
dishes change everytime i have been
not a huge selection
but i left full and quite happy
noticed a bunch of comments on the service
my experience has been that the service is fine
i would not call it stunning
but it is lunch buffet after all
my needs were fairly low water and some bread
the servers have always been helpful in explaining what everything is when i have asked
n joy
congratulations
cafe_krishna
you're the first place i've ever given a star_rating
i'm a vegetarian an i was fully aware that it only serves vegetarian food
so the low rating has nothing to do with being a disappointed meat_eater
my husband and i ate here for dinner
we were the only people in the restaurant when we ordered and it took minutes for our food to arrive at the table
somehow
my food was luke warm
speaking of luke warm
the water i was given to drink was warm tap water with no ice
i can handle drinking tap water
but yeesh
throw some ice in it
when we were finished_eating
we waited for the check
and waited
i then asked for the check
and the person said they'd be right back with it
they never came
so we waited
and waited
finally someone brought us our check
in total we were there for an_hour and a half
most of the time just sitting there waiting for one thing or another
the food itself was meh
nothing spectacular really
i've eaten at plenty of places with terrible service when the food is good enough to balance it out
definitely not the case here
i might come back someday and try the buffet
but i'll never be back there for dinner
went here today based_on yelp_reviews
was nice and clean roomy inside
this is a vegetarian place with no meat on the menu
sounded right up my alley
i ordered curry vegetables
it was pretty good but the portions were very small
waiters were not good
took over min for food to arrive with literally no one else there
took over min
to get the check after we were done despite asking for the check multiple_times
they serve warm tap water with no ice or lemons
overall considering how expensive it was and the fact that its only a block away from my favorite indian place
woodlands
i will not be back
good south_indian food
chass is good to cool off
evenings are not the best time to go
takes a lot of time to get the food
great vegetarian place
i had the uthappam with vadai curry and the okra curry
it was delicious and especially the vadai curry and it was just_the_right_amount_of spice and tasted what i believe to be coconut milk
i really don't like okra but the okra was edible with some garlic_naan
i kind of laughed when i saw chinese options on the menu
i guess only north indians do this but really should remove it from their menu
the service was okay as the guy keeps forgetting to bring some items
no biggie
the place itself is nice and the price was low for an indian place
even at dinner time
so i say this is a must try
you know it will be good when you see indian ppl eating there too
i dont know if the management changed again
the place smells of cleaning supply when you enter
the buffet is horrible
its almost like the dishes are fightng for the worst tasting food competition
fail
after having an okay dinner on a sunday_night
we ordered dessert here
there was an all new wait_staff and they kept changing the music from indian to korean
my husband ordered the dessert called ras malai
he started to eat it and then it kept tasting worse and worse to him
i tried it and i threw up in my napkin
it was awful
when i called the waiter over to tell him that the ras malai had gone bad he said that
i thought that it looked a little iffy
but brought it out anyway
wtf
even our kid had taken a bite when we first got it
husband spent the night in the bathroom to say the least
what a bloody awful experience here
i am really questioning the freshness of all foods here now
yuck
their recommendation of paneer tika_masala was fabulous
nice portion
its not too big
cafe_krishna has always been a regular destination for me
along with the food the staff_was_very_friendly
now
all the old staff has gone and the new staff as hard as they are trying it isn't working
the food is not what it use to be
i hope to come by again and see that they have found their lost spark
cold food
hard idli
watery sambar chutney
used to love their thaali
could use a better air freshner
closed sadly cafe krishna's service went down hill in the last few months and they have now closed
hopefully the replacement will be as good as krishna was before the change in staff
closed
so sad to see this excellent restaurant close
it was veggie only but the food was so good you didn't even miss having meat
o
some of my brown brothers
it's ok
close friends can actually talk about each others' races in good fun
but that's another topic
recommended this place to me
the food was pretty good for dinner but pretty overpriced as well
the little side condiments on the table were great though
there is a waiter
owner
there who looks like me
asian
but speaks like an indian
awesome
god bless america
this is my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in the area by far
they serve quality food with amazing flavors
i am a vegetarian
and they offer so many good entrees that it's hard to choose one
their_lunch_buffet has a variety of selections
and they always change them up
so it's different each time
the service is always excellent too
they are prompt to take your order and serve your food
the best indian food in the valley
we moved here years_ago and never found an indian restaurant we liked until this place
now we are regulars
i had the chicken coconut curry
it was delicious
i got the medium heat one and i had some sweat on my forehead
my family liked it too
i'm happy to find an indian food restaurant that i like
very close to my house
before eating at indian paradise
i couldn't say i had ever eaten indian food while listening to 's techno
but that's all changed now
i can't explain the staff's choice of music the night i visited indian paradise
but it made for interesting ambiance
maybe aloo mattar just tastes better to the tune of
sandstorm
by darude
i found this place while on a mad hunt to satisfy an indian food craving
i swear
when that hits me
i can think of little else
it's nestled in the heart of what seems like chandler's chinatown
and took some effort to find
i'm sure that's more due to my poor sense of direction
the decor was minimal
and i don't mean minimalist just white walls and not much else
the food was good and the service was attentive
i've had better garlic_naan
but it surely wasn't bad
the portion_sizes were generous enough for my sister and i to split our dishes and still have some leftovers
i'll be back for sure
but i'm still happy trying other_indian_places in the valley
haven't found one i'm completely loyal to yet
if you are coming for atmosphere then move along
when we visited on a saturday_night a few weeks back we were the only diners eating in the restaurant for the st mins of our meal
but frankly who cares
i am a nut for chicken_tikka_masala and this place does the best in the valley period
the naan_bread was maybe a little too dry but what did i care when i was dipping it in such deliciousness
i won't go anywhere_else for indian food now
oh what sadness the day that this restaurant decided to move their business to the north scottsdale branch
we always used to order indian food from indian paradise chandler because they made delicious naan
basmati_rice and all things indian curry
for what it's worth go check out the scottsdale branch if you are in the area
i have yet to go but i promised myself that i will put in a good word for this restaurant once i open my yelp account
living in chandler i know that i will be going to the scottsdale branch as soon as i have reason to go in that direction
this is a brand new indian restaurant specializing in grilled food
it's funny because there's a lot of mexican painted ceramic tile around the windows and bathroom
remnants of investments from the previous
failed
owners
the grill's portions are very generous for a reasonable cost
for entr es
if you want it hot and spicy
they are happy to oblige
great breads and sauces and not too long prep times
yes
they are new and working out some kinks in the service
but i definitely see a lot of potential here
quite an interesting experience
unlike almost all indian pakistani places i've been to in my life
this was pretty much the only one where food was plated in such a way as to evoke top chef
the food came on
square i think
plates rather than in dishes and the presentation was excellent
the food was good
not quite what i was used to but ok
those of you without traditional desi tastes will be more pleased i think but that's just my opinion
we ordered the tandoori platter and for the first time it came on plates
not sizzling
we asked about that and it seems to be a cost and ease decision
just fyi if that's your favorite
i would recommend the lentil soup and pappadums most
the two are filling enough for a meal
what made the largest and best impression though was the courtesy of the owner's son politeness
friendliness
response time can't be beat
incredibly good for casual dining
the flavors are exceptional
the menu is very inexpensive
they were realistic about the heat of the dishes
i loved the mango juice which complimented the spiciness of my chicken_vindaloo very nicely
it reminded_me_of eating in nyc
which is perhaps the best compliment i can give as an east coast transplant
this review is for the lunch buffet here at india's grill
the restaurant is nice inside
modern looking with it's
open pipe
ceiling
such as is popular around here right now
soft indian music played in the background
both booths tables are available for seating
my server brought over plenty of hot
seasoned naan_bread as i went for some of their vegetable soup
to find that only tiny bowls were available to get some of it in
not only that
the soup spoons
at least the one i was given
were just the opposite
huge
almost serving spoon size
back at the booth
the table was too far away
if you pulled it in to be the right distance out on one side
you could drive a mahindra truck through on the other side without running over desirupa's feet
then
back over at the serving table
some of the foods were labeled some not
ok
so stars we're out of here
right
well
not so fast
for one
the soup in the thimble
ur
tiny bowl
was delicious
the salad actually had salad dressing available for it
which is amazing for an indian buffet
the temperature of everything was about right
the foods weren't too soupy
as they sometimes are at these places
the taste of everything was excellent for the most part
if a little salty
they do fix it real spicy here
so if you come
leave the kids at mcdonald's keep your glass_of_water
a forehead napkin
close at hand
lunch buffet
includes hot indian style tea
wow i didn't think you could mess up indian food this badly
i came here after a quick glance at the reviews here so i was optimistic
we arrived late only two other tables occupied
so i realize i was pushing my luck on 'fresh cooked'
we stuck to basics
the papadums arrived and they were good stars for this
not freshly cooked
but crispy and not oily
we ordered the chicken tandoori
a paratha bread
and some appetizers
the appetizers were dry and powdery but let's just ignore those
the paratha bread looked freshly prepared
and had a decent texture
but tasted like it has been cooked in oil that had been used and abused way too much
i'm all for tasty oil
this was just weird
the taste was awful
but the tandoori_chicken was the worst
the chicken arrived with 'stuff' piled on top of it tomatoes
onions
some kind of 'sauce' i guess so the chicken was all goopy and wet
not the texture you expect for something supposedly taken straight out of a super hot oven
my guess is
they didn't want to fire up the tandoori oven
so just microwaved a bunch of chicken pieces and dumped some stuff on top
i drove all the way from scottsdale at pm on a friday_night for this
i was born raised in england
and now reside primarily in the bay_area
home to many indians
so i feel like i know what a good indian meal should taste like
i was in town visiting my family and we stopped here to try it
the owners used to live next to my parents
we have been meaning to try the place so we did
the food and service was excellent
the selection was great and i do like that you can see the kitchen from the dinning room
that's always comforting for a patron
the dishes we enjoyed were
the vegetable_samosas awesome
garlic paneer naan the garlic_naan is sooo much better
chicken tandori great flavor
chana_masala great
vegetable_biryani great
baigan bharta awesome
they also provide an awesome spicy green sauce that goes great on everything
if you are a fan of indian try this place
if_you_are_looking for something different
try this place
i will be back
have been here several times
both for the lunch buffet and dinner
service can be a little slow
generally a pretty quiet restaurant
but the people working there are more than polite
overall
i think the food is very good especially like the chicken tandoori
butter_chicken and the fresh cooked naan
our first experience with indian_cuisine
and we will go back
we explained that it was our first time when we came in and the staff was supremely understanding and took their time telling us what was in the food
there is a great selection of vegetarian_dishes
the menu is reasonably_priced
just under for naan
entrees
and dessert
we never had empty water glasses
we really enjoyed the food
can't say what it's supposed to taste like because we've never had indian before tonight
but we can say that we really liked our dishes
the garlic_naan was yum and the malai_kofta i ordered was easily made without onions
upon request
and my husband's food was spicy enough for him that he didn't complain_about it being weak
dessert was not up my alley
but hubbie happily finished_eating my portion
we'll go back
and we'll take people with us when we do
nice_atmosphere
fantastic service and more importantly flavorful and delicious food
we had the chilling chicken and garlic_naan
this is quite possibly the most delicious indian i have ever had
highly_recommend
great food
been here twice and have liked everything i have eatin
last time i couldn't decide and asked the waiter to pick something for me and surprise me
whatever he picked was great
lots of taste and very filling
service is great
they all take good care of you
this place is wonderful
fantastic service
they explain things for those of you who are new to indian food
better than any other indian place i have tried and i have tried alot
open kitchen so you can see them cooking and the place was very clean
the garlic_naan is a must try
my husband is not a fan_of_indian_food but he enjoyed the tandori mixed_grill and the kema naan
we will_be_going_back for more soon
i really enjoyed the food
they provide a nice selection and the price is great
the atmosphere was a little lacking
but the staff was very nice
my husband didn't care for it
but he's not a big_fan of indian food
i will absolutely be back for the garlic_naan
yum
really really enjoyed the buffet at this place
good stuff and all quality_ingredients
we tend to eat at a lot of indian places and this place is definately quality for arizona
we discovered_this_place about six months_ago via restaurant
com after trying virtually every other indian restaurant in gilbert
chandler and mesa and not finding one that stands up to the great indian food we had when we lived in the bay_area
this is by far the best here and comes closest to the amazing indian food we enjoyed in california
the chicken_tikka and chicken_tikka_masala are outstanding
as is the naan_bread
the chana_masala is quite good
too
we only order_off_the_menu
haven't tried the buffet
and i've now been back dozens of times
and have taken friends and family
they all agree this is the best they've had here in the phoenix area
service is decent as well
nice family that runs it
oh
and if you're worried that indian food is too spicy for you
just ask them to make it
super mild
they are able to get it right and make it so i can eat it
and i don't like spicy food at all
i may bump this place up to stars on my next visit
the presentation was very good
the food smelled great
the service was very good
my criticisms are that the mixed_grill was mostly overdone
not so much that it was bad
it was very flavorful
but the shrimp was chewy and the lamb was overdone as well
the garlic_naan was awesome
the chicken_tikka was very flavorful and was very different than other places i've had it
the portion on the naan was great
less so on the tikka and the mixed_grill
the place has a nice
open layout and features accents of broken plates worked into the columns and other areas
it was good
i have only eaten here twice with some friends and family
i can say this though
the chicken_vindaloo was amazing
i ordered it spicy the way god intended it
awesome
if you're a novice don't even try to order spicy though
you'll die
also the chicken_tikka_masala was a little slice of heaven
this is the best indian restaurant around
i have been to every indian restaurant in town
i used to go to indian paradise and guru palace regularly
then i started going here
this is the only indian restaurant in phoenix that uses real lamb
not beef
check the texture at other places next time
the flavor is incredible
most_importantly the owners are great people
i have become very good friends with them the past year
i bring all my friends there and they are well taken_care_of
this is my favorite place to eat
i recommend the lamb saag
lamb boti masala
and lamb_vindaloo with paneer naan
hope to see all of you guys there
you will not be dissapointed
when i entered at normal dinner time
there was only other customers than my party
i was really worried that the food would be horrible and a waste of a groupon
i ordered the usual dishes i would get with my parents
garlic_naan
onion kulcha
mattar_paneer
palak_paneer
and chana_masala
each of the dishes had an unique taste than what i expected
it tasted different
but it was good
my major negative is we asked for medium_spice and the food was very mild
in addition
i had to try really hard to try the garlic in the garlic_naan
the food comes in decent portion
but it might be a couple bucks overpriced per dish
i would come here again to try some non vegetarian_dishes or the buffet
wow
i had a taste for indian and just happened to stumble upon the lunch buffet
for
i had an unbelievabe lunch
a decent
but not exhausted selection of popular indian dishes
what amazed me is that every one i sampled was excellent
and then they brought out bread
as if the buffet wasn't enough
i'll be back often
love it
first of all the food is wonderful
every time we go we try something different and have yet to be disappointed
i recommend the lamb masala
spicy of course
and my husband loves the chicken_vindaloo
dinner is great here with nice sized portions
lunch has a great buffet available
which offers different options each time
giving us the chance to try new dishes
i would have to say the best part is the service
india grill is clearly run by a very kind family who knows how to take care of their customers
we once went to the lunch buffet a bit close to the end lunch service
they were serving one of my very favorites
lamb tekka masala
but they were pretty much out
when i asked the server
a young guy who always serves us and is awesome
if they would be replenishing this dish
he said he would see what he could do
and promptly returned with my own mini serving of the dish
if he had come back and said they were not replenishing i would have totally understood
but as always the staff went above and beyond
with all the indian food options in the valley
we continue to return over and over knowing we will always receive amazing service
go there
now
you won't regret it
garlic_naan bread and bbq flavored chicken
tastes ok but not looking to eat american food
don't_get_me_wrong the garlic bread was tasty but unexpected when i mixed it with my curry chicken
boo
went here on a saturday afternoon and there were of us
i don't really care for buffet food at indian_restaurants
so we had take out
the place looks good enough from the inside
but i was extremely disappointed by the food
all of the naan were burnt on the underside
the kofta curry had coconut in it
which is kind of odd
not to mention all of us had stomach problems the very next day
now if it was just one person
then i can understand
but as all three of us felt sick
i have no doubt in my mind that it was their food
will never try this place again
my husband i love_this_place
service
food
and cleanliness of restaurant are all great
the malai_kofta and lamb_korma with some garlic_naan on the side
my mouth is already watering
we've tried almost all the indian places in the mesa chandler gilbert area and this one is awesome
did i mention great prices for the amount of food you get
we have also been given several complimentary sides just because
very nice staff
still haven't had a bad dish off their menu and i've tried just about all of it
maybe this place deserves stars
but i'm not a connoisseur when it comes to indian food i only know that this place serves up some great dishes
my favorite is the mixed_grill and my wife loves the butter_chicken
the naan_bread appetizers are extremely yummi and the prices_are_reasonable
the dining_room isn't anything to write_home_about
but it's fun to watch the indian music_videos on the big tvs
and the service is very friendly_and_attentive
will be back
my wife and have been to pretty much every indian restaurant in phoenix
we go almost every week
since we went here
we have never went anywhere_else
except when traveling
the food here is fantastic
the staff has always been great
but the food
oh the food
did i say it was fantastic
my personal favorite is the baigan bharta
my wife's is the paneer tika_masala
but
all is great
i give this place stars
but i'd rather say
since i've only been there once
i think the extra
points is for potential
i like indian food and i like it enough to eat it when i can
don't_get_me_wrong
i'm no indian food connoisseur but i really like bold tasting food with lots of spices and flavors
and i really
really like my curry
i came in here on my lunch break
skeptical of what i'd find from an indian buffet
not too bad
your basic selection of chicken_tikki_masala
coconut curry
lentils
indian bbq
etc
overall
taste was nice and satisfied my hunger pangs
on_the_other_hand
i'm not sure i like how they made their naan
it tasted like garlic bread
looked like some pita overloaded with parsley
and was not soft like i've had at other places
but that's okay
because i filled myself up on the buffet
service was fast and friendly
and the atmosphere is comfortable
maybe a little too big for its own sake
but hey
that's quite all right
closed
this location has closed
i'm usually stay far away from buffets
however i am very happy i decided_to_give this place a try
my mom and i were both in the mood to try some place new and after driving around and checking out all of commerical center we decided a indian food sounded pretty yummy
after eating there
i decide this really is the only way to go out for indian food with just people because i always want to try just a little bit of everything
at namaste you can
and everything i tasted was fantastic
eat here for lunch
lunch buffet
really amazing food
good service
i can't_wait_to_go_back
the food was excellent and it's probably the best indian buffet in las_vegas so far
this restaurant is very new
so i'm not sure if their quality will degrade over time
i have seen a lot of new restaurants made great food when they just opened but then their food quality went down hill as time goes by
i hope it's not true for this restaurant because i truely enjoyed my lunch
i will update my rating if their quality changes
this place was so hyped up that i was expecting something out_of_this_world delicious
my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in the entire world is bombay club in harvard square
delicious
in my eyes
you_can't_beat it
so
i came in here with high hopes
this was the first indian restaurant i've tried in vegas
it's right next to lotus of siam
and right away that was a good sign for me
anything that someone in my group of foodie friends recommends that is in a seedy strip_mall has to be good
started_off_with a kingfisher beer
papadom
and the requisite sauces
friend_of_mine got the mulligatawny soup
i didn't try it
but he said it was good
for dinner
i got the chicken_vindaloo and kheema naan
lamb stuffed bread
i asked them to make the vindaloo as hot as they could
and i didn't have a problem eating it
wasn't as spicy as i thought it'd be
i mean
it was spicy
but it wasn't like oh my god im going to die if i dont get water right now aigdjgsadjg kind of spicy
na'mean
overall
though
high_quality food for a very low price
i was impressed with the place and i'll definitely_be_going_back again
the best_indian_food_in_vegas
my girlfriend and i were accidentally one of the first people to eat at namaste
we were in the area and are very familiar with the great places in the tucked_away commercial center
as i recall we were considering going to komol
one of our favorite thai food restaurants and hangouts
when we saw that namaste was finally open
we both love indian food as she primarily eats vegetarian and indian_restaurants are easy targets for us
the lunch buffet for is not to be missed
indian_buffets are hit_or_miss
some will put out the standard dishes and only have one or two really yummy entrees set out
not namaste
they pull out all the stops and have many favorite dishes out at the same time
mind you
the place is new
and many new places will start out this way and then go downhill
but i don't think this will be the case with namaste
chef and owner
om singh
has a reputation that precedes him in the culinary world and i suspect that the quality at namaste will endure
we have eaten here many times since it has opened up and every meal has been outstanding
most notably
the vegetarian dinner for two
is perfect
from the first course to the last it is exceptionally yummy
the main_courses are all super good and it was so plentiful we had a lot of left_overs for lunch_the_next_day
and the dessert
especially the carrot one
is really good
the wait_staff is very friendly and are constantly circling the floor
the atmosphere is decent and comfortable
i attend a discussion group every sunday_afternoon and we usually go out to dinner afterward
komol is one of our regular haunts
but now it seems that namaste will be our new default location
i really love_this_place
me and my friend went here for the lunch buffet a couple weeks_ago after finding a coupon for it in one of the vegas booklets
i think the coupon might've been buy get free
it was a really good deal
once you walk in
you enter a somewhat small dining_area with dark walls and dark furniture which gave it a pretty nice ambiance
once you are seated
you just get up and go over to the buffet area
it looks pretty small
but what they have is more than enough
i tried everything that was in the buffet and it was all delicious
i tried to eat as much as i possibly could because it was so good
my favorite was the palak panneer
it was just incredible
i made trips to the buffet just to get more and more of that
i was so stuffed
i definitely recommend the lunch buffet for anyone that wants a nice taste of indian food for a low price
i will be back here asap once i find someone to go with me
if this is
best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
i will go for some other cuisine
daal very good
bhindi good
pakoras dry
salty
chicken kabab dry
rest average
if you drink beer
try kingfisher in standard oz bottle
avoid indian beers that come in larger bottles
this refers to the lunch buffet only at this time
what you need to know
a nice indian place conveniently located next to lotus of siam
warm decor and very friendly and competent staff
weird hours
grab a takeout menu and write them down
good selection of buffet items
especially the lamb dishes
given that there are few good indian places
this is a must try
downsides
some dishes get a bit cool on the buffet line
think deep_fried veggies
right next_door to one of the best restaurants_in_town
given a choice
commercial center
not a superb location
definitely worthy of another go
luncheon buffet i sampled the pakora
indian pickles
raita
tamarind and mint sauces
fresh naan
basmati_rice
chicken and lamb curries
saag
sambar and gajar halwa
we have never dined at an indian buffet in las_vegas
but it did not compare well to the ones we frequent in connecticut
this is not the best_indian_food_in_vegas
i'm disappointed to say
the buffet has not changed since folks last reviewedin fact it was the same lineup
the service was poor
i asked the waiter for garam masala rice
basic white basmati with hot spices
but he could not make it happen
my family had never been to an indian place and they loved it
could not stop talking_about finally eating the lamb
got to love the holidays
final review
basic indian buffet
per_person is an expensive lunch in this town
could be done a lot better
one star
was trying to go to lotus of siam next_door
but line was too long
so we went here instead
which i assume is how they get most of their biz
food was good but nothing really stood_out over other indian joints
my boyfriend and i shared the veggie dinner for
which was
service was good
restroom is very clean
place is nicely_decorated
went for dinner with folks
service spotty
starters awful
main_course was ok
mom ordered chardonnay
for which the only descriptive word she could find was
ganges
i am told that lunch buffet is good
i would not recommend for dinner
judging from the range of scores from other reviewers i think your liking of namaste might be based_on a particular preference toward indian food done a specific way
i couldn't quite put my finger on what it was
but i just didn't enjoy my meal here very much
the chicken_tikka_masala was filled with huge chunks of dark meat chicken
i'm not usually a fan of dark meat but indian_cuisine usually gets it to really blend with the sauces and spices
this wasn't the case here it was like tasteless brown meat dipped on sauce
meat and veg dishes on the lunch buffet were ok
but a little odd paneer mixed in with a dry sort of veg offering was a little unusual and out of place
overall ok
but not in my first few choices for vegas indian
had very high hopes for this place based_on the rave reviews of our local food critics
unfortunately
i gotta give it a big thumbs down
went for the lunch buffet so that is all i can speak about
all the veggie dishes were super bland
garbanzo bean dish was best of the bunch but that was it
butter_chicken was also good
the tandori
sp
chicken was grey and completely unappealing looking
naan was fine but very greasy
if you like spicy food like i do
this is not the place for you
not sure where all the raves come for this place dinner menu maybe
i like the nearby india_oven better for the lunch buffet
all places have good and bad days so ymmv as the cliche goes
quite a bargin for
the buffet was fresh
and was served with a basket of warm
buttery naan
the saag_paneer was very good
and the butter_chicken was a mildly spiced curry in a rich sauce
the decor is simple and dark
a good place for a date
excellent food
i'm not a particular fan_of_indian_food but i must say that this is definitely the best i've ever tasted
me and my fiancee came here for v day after hearing it was one of the most romantic restaurants_in_vegas
the location
sahara and commercial center
is a bit of a grungy area but we go there to eat at komol's quite often so the less than romantic exterior didn't bother me too much
the interior is dimly lit and pretty cozy as well
we got seated_right_away and had our orders taken within the next minutes
we had a vegetable
carrot
onion
and parsley
ensemble for our starter dishes which was quite spicy but very tasty
i also had the vegetarian stir fry which was brought out on a steaming hot plate and smelled just as good as it tasted
this dish had a typical stir fry 'onion y' taste and came complete with cauliflower
red and green peppers
grilled tofu
and more parsley
my main_dish was a vegetarian curry and it was awesome
i also had garlic_naan and kashmiri naan which was also killer
the kashmiri naan was naan with a cherry like filling and it wasn't too sweet
complementing the buttery naan exterior very nicely
i also had the rice_pudding for dessert and it was standard like other rice puddings i've had before
food aside
the service was pretty good
they were a bit slow in bringing our food out and that was a bit irritating
we were there for almost hours and we are definitely not slow eaters
they got my order wrong three times during our visit
the wine was the wrong one and decided to let that one slide but they brought out the wrong appetizer and wrong curry
still not sure how that happened
but i let them know i got the wrong dishes and they gladly replaced them with the right ones and pretty quickly
at that
they also added a percent discount on our bill and gave_us extra naan
now that's service
we didn't ask for the discount or naan so that was a real pleasant surprise
they had a valentine's special going so dishes and a dessert with a glass_of_wine came out to be a person which was actually pretty good considering the regular prices of the plates which averaged around dollars each
overall
the service was a little slow but good and the food was awesome
definitely coming_back to experience namaste again in the future
not bad at all
i only heard of this place because of restaurant
com's deal coupon's
i'm always looking for new places so when this came up i figured
wth
glad i did too
i went with my girl and some friends and got orders of the
dinner for
the food was top_notch
very yummy
the only drawback was the service
now are waters were always full and such but that was from the busboy
the server left much to be desired
now i'm not one to like the server there every seconds asking how it was but damn this guy was slow on everything and in the end he ended_up taking my coupon and splitting it between us and the other couple
without asking
needless_to_say i was not thrilled about that
will i go back
for the food
yes
but not the service
fantastic lunch buffet for the price
friendly_staff
delicious butter_chicken and some crazy carrot salad dish that is like crack i couldnt stop
yum
my boss recommended this indian restaurant to me and also the chicken_korma while i was there
i ended_up getting the chicken_korma along with bombay salad
tandoori shrimp
on the pricier side
and garlic_naan
so delicious
the garlic_naan was fantastic
the service wasn't anything spectacular
but i really enjoyed the meal pretty thoroughly
stars for great dishes
stepped into this place for a pre show dinner because there was a wait at lotus of siam next_door and will definitely_be_going_back for more
for appetizers
entrees
premium beers and a dessert our bill was
we had the vegetable_pakora
onion bahji paneer naan to start things off
while we waited the waiter brought out some popadoms on the house with a sweet sauce and spicy sauce
nice
for our main_courses we had the chicken_vindaloo
chicken potatoes stewed with curry over rice
chicken biriani
chicken
cashew nuts
vegetables
basmati_rice
i enjoyed everything we had
and though it was probably a mistake to get fried appetizers the pakora bhaji were great the naan_bread was soft and tasty
the vindaloo
for me
was perfect
it was spicy but not overpowering
and the flavors really came through in the sauce along with the tender and juicy chicken
it may not be as spicy as some lotus regulars are used to but i thought it was spot on
the only complaint my gf had about her dish was that it could have used more cashews
i was skeptical when she ordered the carrot based dessert
but was surprised at how good it was
probably the healthiest dessert you will ever eat
the service was quick and friendly
and i hope this place sticks around
it didn't seem that busy at ish on a tuesday
though we were surprised to see the mayor and his wife walk through the door and sit at the adjacent booth midway through our meal
my fav indian food restaurant for dinner we had the tasting set dinner for two people and everything was soooo flavorful
the chicken_tikka_masala tasted great
i suppose they make it with really flavorful tandoori_chicken
and the sauce has a great depth in taste
the spinach paneer and lamb was also savory
and you can really have a good taste of the spices from their dishes
went there last week for the buffet
everything was good but not a lot of variety
dinner was better
indian_lunch_buffets were on my mind
especially have hearing misti y
praise their deliciousness
we pull into commercial center at
pm on a sunday
as we park the car
we notice there aren't too many other cars parked out front
hmmm
as we open the door
what a shock to see
the place was packed full of indians
this was a great sign
i wasn't sure if there was a wait with all the people standing around of if there was a private party
with no one to greet us at the front
the husband goes in search of an empty table
he finds one last table at the far back and after checking with a waiter
i get the affirmative wave
i tell him to start first on the buffet line
meanwhile
i ask a waiter for some utensils
when the waiter brings over our water
he apologizes as a tour group had just arrived
which explains all the craziness
nonetheless
an indian tour group stops at namaste in commercial center
of all places
for their lunch en route is still a good sign
my turn at the buffet line
now
i'm no expert on indian_buffets as i've been to only a couple
but i think the spread was pretty good for
my favorite was the vegetable_korma
vegetable cooked in creamy cashew nut gravy finished with almond and garnished with coriander and cream
this was good on rice or the hot naan
unleavened white bread
they provided
i also liked the sauce from the chicken_tikka_masala
tender pieces of chicken_breast roasted in homemade creamy tomato
however
we both found the chicken pieces itself to be dry
i also liked the allo jerra
which were ultimately potatoes
the husband was loving the saag_paneer
spinach cooked with homemade cheese
and the goat_curry
other items on the buffet line were pakara
a fried veggie
cholle masala
a dish with chickpeas
and a cabbage masala
something that was both new to us was the uttapam
a thick pancake with a sour like taste that was topped with a bit of tomato and onion
traditionally it's made from rice that has been fermented
which explains it's tangy taste
finishing off the meal was the kheer
traditional_indian rice_pudding with nuts
flavored with cardamon and rose
at one point
i helped myself to the water pitcher
i wasn't sure if this was self serve since there were about four water pitchers right next to where we were sitting and the place was so crowded
they did end up refilling my glass the next times though
the waiters were pretty friendly to us once the crowd got settled in more and started clearing out
they were quick to clear out our dirty dishes and refill the water glasses
namaste also has a simple
but pleasant decor with its mango painted walls
which i'm sure makes one crave a mango_lassi
overall
definitely not a bad choice for an indian buffet
i was so stuffed from that meal that i didn't eat again until pm that night
i don't know if it's always this busy on sundays though
so keep that in mind
waking up late on a sunday_afternoon
and influenced by the wife and some comments from misti y
we decided that our first meal of the day was going to be some indian food at namaste
the restaurant is located in the commercial center right next to lotus of siam
we were reassured to find the place packed full of hungry eaters
mostly of indian descent
we later found out that most of the diners were from a tour group
we were a bit worried about how we were going to score a table
luckily
there was one empty table to be found near the end of the buffet line
the food looked and smelled incredible
i was starving
but i had to wait in line
there was so much to choose from for this
lunch buffet
i just followed suit and placed whatever everybody else ahead of me was grabbing
i couldn't stop dipping my hot buttery naan into the green chutney
it was tangy with a minty finish
i also enjoyed heaps of my favorite saag_paneer
creamy spinach with chunks of cheese
usually
at buffets
i find the saag_paneer to be dried_out
but here it was very wet
for meat
i really liked the goat_curry
the meat was pungent and very tender
the sauce was tasty and spicy and compliment well with the rice
the dish that i did not enjoy was the chicken curry
those pieces of chicken_breast was so dry
even though they were submerged in all that curry_sauce
this is great place to go for an indian lunch buffet
we_will_definitely_be_back
i hope to return for dinner at least to sample my other favorite indian dish
lamb_biryani and wash that down with a mango_lassi
this is a place you have to try
we usually go a couple_of_times per month for their_lunch_buffet
we always eat too much of their food
last time we were there
the server came by with something that he wanted us to try and the sauce to go with it
i thought it was so nice that he would go out of his way during the lunch buffet
but his tip did increase
so maybe that was his point
great service
great food
let's keep this place in business
sweet and simple
this place is fantastic
my boyfriend told me about this place so we decided to go
i hadn't eaten india food in a while so i was up for something different
anything you try you will like
they also ask you how spicy you would like your food and it came out perfect
i had the chicken_tikka_masala
amazing
it was lil spicy and full of flavor
my boyfriend had the lamb in a cashew gravy with the garlic_naan
it was so good
we finished everything and didn't feel full
i would definitely recommend_this_place_to_anyone looking for something different besides bar food
stars in my book
oh and the staff was great
very nice and fast service
we will be back very soon
i've been to namaste once and had the lunch buffet
the food seemed very stale and the quality passable
not at all something we'd frequent again
the topper is the fact that namaste has been shut down multiple_times for health code violations
that just does not sit will with me
the recent reviews seem to suggest the food has improved
i'm not sure about that as i don't dare eat there after my first experience and their hygiene issues
coming from a tourist's perspective
namaste was a welcome refuge from the crap on the strip
also obviously goes a lot farther elsewhere
we ordered the aloo tikee appetizer after they were out of veggie_samosas and we were not disappointed
i had lamb_tikka_masala and my girlfriend had the malai_kofta
everything was delicious with a perfect level of heat
we also enjoyed the dark wood decor and the service was pretty good
i don't know what it's like normally because we were one of two tables in the place at pm
one caveat
don't order coffee because they only have instant
unpretentious decor and friendly service more importantly
the food is very good
order the chicken_korma
it rocks
you won't be sorry you did
the naan kashmiri was unlike any other naan i'd had before
in a good way
first appearances can be deceiving
hubby and i were feeling a bit nervous when we pulled into the sahara commercial center that place just looks sad
but oh
everything brightened when we walked into namaste and tried their
lunch buffet
every_single item tasted excellent we filled our plates with all kinds of delicious things like butter_chicken
navaratna korma
aloo palak
masala mutton
and then the waiter brought us a basket of fresh hot butter naan to the table
oh_yeah
but it got even better
several minutes_later
he brought us a freshly cooked plate of uttapam yes you read that right
we love south_indian snacks and it's just not so easy_to_find that here in vegas
that little touch pushed us into masala bliss
the other cool thing that will draw us back for a dinner is that they serve quite a few goan specialties
such as chicken xacutti and goan shrimp_curry all quite amazing and different from their northern indian style counterparts
happy eating
tandoori_chicken here is awesome
i've been several times but it's been months so when i went back i was suprised to see they changed ownership
we were greeted_by a sweet lady who took our owner
after our food was delivered quickly
she serenaded our table and others karaoke style
gurl can sang
nice
cute touch so i'll definitely come back
the buffet here is a really good deal so you can try a little bit of everything
i d pay a few bucks more if they offered my favorite here lamb_vindaloo
i went for the lunch buffet to try a variety_of_dishes and they did_not_disappoint
a perfect balance of vegetarian and meat dishes
there was a couple of dishes that had some kick but not where it overwhelmed the dish entirely
i will_be_returning for the dinner menu soon
good cooking here
for a hole_in_the_wall place
service was poor
one person for the whole dining
room
cashier and hostess
person doing it all
i arrived at pm
sadly they do not refresh their buffet
it was dried up
it still tasted fine
but not very apetizing
so get there early
and enjoy the super oily naan
wow
we stopped in for lunch and we were pleasantly_surprised
the lunch buffet was great
some indian_buffets only have a few basic foods and skimp on the naan and chutneys
not this place
they had all of your favorites
plenty of chutneys and kept fresh naan on our table the entire time
i can't say enough good things about this place
make sure you stop in for the lunch buffet and maybe you will be lucky enough to be serenaded by the nice woman who works here
overall
great place and we will return the next time we are in vegas
namaste hello
i've been waiting quite awhile to meet you
i came today to try your lunch buffet
and it's every bit as good as others have commented
i ate mostly vegetarian_dishes because they were so good and they came first on the buffet
there wasn't much room for anything else
well yes there was
but the vegetarian selections were excellent
for plate one
i had some saag_paneer
dal maknni
butter_chicken and another chicken whose name i can't remember
note to self bring a notepad
the spiciness of the first two dishes the vegetarian ones was simply superb
the spices were not overpowering but were just right
there was also a little bite which is always welcome
for plate two
i had some aloo korma
fried cabbage
eggplant bartha
and some more dal maknni
again
the flavors were outstanding
plate three i tried three of their chutneys tamarind
coconut
and mint
they were all good
but the tamarind was my favorite
i used them as a condiment on my naan
while it was not needed the naan was excellent i did want to try the chutneys alone and this was the bets option for me
my last dish was a small bowl of mango_custard that was a perfect ending to the meal
service was right on
dishes were removed
iced_tea refilled
and the waiter checked on me often to see if there was anything i needed
the hostess was a simply lovely woman who was very friendly
she had to leave while i was eating to run an errand
and she came over and thanked me for coming by and asked me to return
top_notch customer interaction
i will be back
now i need to nap
again
hello namaste
finally went here for the lunch buffet and was not disappointed
great service
liked the decor and most_importantly the food was great
and you cannot beat the price of
another indian lunch buffet that i like is tandoori but this place is equivalent and cheaper
thanks namaste
after hearing misti and bobby y
rave about this place
we finally got to try namaste during misti's cmye in conjunction with the cac
we shared a table with fellow yelpers tony
judd
and lynn
usually the buffet is only served during lunch hours
but they made an exception for this event
if you haven't been to namaste within the last months
i strongly suggest you do so
the food was outstanding
they have changed ownership and the person running the show now is melque
pronounced
milky
rodriguez
she and her cooks are natives from goa
and besides being the owner
she is also a professional singer
and your friendly hostess and server
the buffet had quite a few meat and vegetarian_options saag_paneer
veggie_samosas
veggie biriyani
tandoori_chicken
chicken_vindaloo
butter_chicken
ghana chat
yellow dal
navratham korma
the list goes on and on
after a good couple rounds
i was happily stuffed and we'll_definitely_be_back to try other items on the menu
aloha
let it be known i'm not the biggest fan_of_indian_food
i don't like spicy food
i hate whatever it is that makes curry yellow
tumeric
and don't get me started on the carbs
indian_buffets are typically more pain than pleasure for me
but i'm always down to join a group at an indian buffet every so often for variety sake
i've been to or so indian_buffets in my life
but this one tops them all
i might just bend my
only eat indian a few times a year
rule for this place
the ownership is new ish
they bought the place back in june
the owners are super sweet
and most_importantly the food is awesome
like i said
i don't enjoy indian food but i can't get their butter_chicken out of my head
i've never had such amazing butter_chicken before
i put myself in a disgusting naan butter_chicken food coma
i just couldn't stop_eating it
i will say the offerings are relatively small
but they are all quality
everything was fresh and tasty and made with care
while the food
atmosphere
and price
were all right on point
the highlight of my meal was when the owner serenaded us with unforgettable by natalie cole
she literally picked_up a mic
piped in some back ground music and points to my table and says
this one goes out to the three ladies to my right
lol
sheer awesomeness
i've_never_seen owner
karaoke
in an indian buffet before
the new owner rocks personable
good with food
and moonlights as a lounge singer
i felt nothing but love the entire time we were there
yup
it's decided
despite the carbs ensuing pain from too much butter_chicken i might just have to come back here more often
excellent food
i loved the kadai chicken and malai_kofta
hostess offered us complimentary rice which was nice of her
would prefer to have the servers dressed a bit professionally rather than street clothes
the new ownership of namaste
improved health department standard as well as stellar reviews and recommendations made me suggest this as the place for a co worker's birthday lunch
i shared the yelp link with all and we were waiting with anticipation to partake in a bevy of curries and mop that up with naan
namaste is really well done up
dark wood paneling
soft muted lighting
cosy booths
i can see how this place could be the setting for quite the romantic date_night
although indian food may not be something you want to be eating on the first few dates
melque
the owner was very very personable
she checked up on us multiple_times and sang a song
ungforgettable
during lunch
yes
it was a little strange and hard to talk to my table but she did have a good voice and she's just so sweet
now the food
i only ate vegetarian since
i am vegetarian
a fairly extensive selection at namaste so that was really nice
there were the usual salads and chutneys all of which were very fresh
the navaratan korma
mixed_vegetable curry
was really really good
the soft basmati_rice with peas also very comforting and the dal_makhani was creamy and tasty
i wasn't a fan of the uthapam and sambar
the uthapam was too sour
i guess the batter fermented a little too long
and i'm reiterating my usual complaint that no restaurant knows what sambar is in las_vegas
the aloo_gobi and spinach and potato puree were passable
we got a basket of garlic naans that was tasty but rather tough and dry
my co_workers enjoyed the carnivorous fare but everyone asked me the same thing when we left
when are we going to mount_everest again
i'll_definitely_be_back as namaste is one of the better buffets in town and the service and ambiance is really top_notch
we got free tickets to a show at the hilton last_night and were looking for a restaurant to try in the general area
i've read a lot of good reviews for namaste so we decided_to_give it a try
i had thought about going there a couple_of_times but could never bring myself to do it
i love los and just couldn't imagine walking past los to go to another restaurant
i'm glad i decided to do so last_night
we ordered garlic_naan
chicken biriani
waitress' suggestion house specialty
paneer malai
cheese in a creamy onion sauce
and kheema mutter
ground lamb in a curry_sauce
we were given papadum to start
it was good and i really liked the mint_chutney that accompanied it
i wasn't as fond of the tamarind_chutney
but that's because i'm not a big_fan of tamarind
my wife had a mango_lassi
she said it was good but that she's had better
she prefers hers a little thicker and sweeter
the garlic_naan was good but was a little under cooked and doughy
the chicken biriani was my wife's favorite
i liked it quite a bit
but it was a tad too minty for me
my favorite was the lamb_curry
i thought the flavors were really well balanced
the paneer malai was our least favorite
though we still liked it quite a bit
it was a tad sweet for me
they also gave_us regular naan which was good and buttery
about half way through our dinner
the waitress began to sing
she had a really nice voice
because of her accent
some of the words were a little off on pronunciation or cadence
but overall i enjoyed her singing
my one complaint was that she had the volume up pretty high
which made it very hard to talk while she was singing
she only sang a few songs though
so it wasn't too disruptive
overall
we enjoyed our meal quite a bit
next time we're going to try the lunch buffet which one of the waiters recommended
as do a bunch of yelpers
namaste's pretty close to my office so if it's good
i may become a regular
don't let the sketchy exterior of this place fool you
it's actually a pretty nice and clean restaurant
the owner who also is the main entertainer is really nice and has a great singing voice
there was also a belly_dancer who kept things lively and entertaining as well
food was reasonably_priced and very good
everyone in our people group enjoyed their food very much
three of us shared the lamb_vindaloo and the tandori grill plate
that was freaking delicious
very good seasoning and flavor on the chicken
lamb and shrimp
my_only_complaint is about the naan
it was a bit too toasted and not soft like what i'm used to
but no biggie
it was still very good
overall this place was a hit
the main reason i can't give it stars is mainly due to the service
although the waiters were friendly
they seemed a bit confused and the food took a long time to come out
which i'm sure was due to our large_party
other than that i would_definitely_recommend_this_place
vegas is a mecca for many great food genres
unfortunately indian is not one of them
luckily
in this wasteland there is namaste
this is my favorite indian_buffet_in_town
they keep the line fresh and clean and there are tons of options
i remember reading an article in the lv weekly claiming they have the best chicken in town
now that may be a bit of an overstatement
but their tandori_chicken is pretty delicious
when i'm in the area
it's hard for me not to end up at komol
but i'm sometimes able to fight the urge and end up at namaste
i could do without the karaoke while i eat
but it is pretty entertaining
ie humorous
lunch or dinner
it's all good
this is one of my favorite restaurants in las_vegas and a must if you appreciate good indian food
the lunch buffet is excellent
always some different items and a great variety
butter_chicken
if you know me
i should be able to write those two words and be done with this review
for everyone_else
well i guess i'll keep going
with all the great reviews about namaste's lunch buffet
i've been meaning to try it for quite some time
i finally had the excuse last weekend with one of my meetup groups
situated in commercial center
it's not the nicest neighborhood
but being right next to lotus of siam
they have certainly associated themselves with a good neighbor
the interior is well decorated with quite a bit of wood trim
the buffet area isn't huge
but provides a good selection
for me though
it's all about the butter_chicken
all i need is butter_chicken and naan for dipping and i'm a happy camper
it's just so freakin' delicious
i should mention a little tidbit
we were all enjoying our meals and conversation when we suddenly heard one of the owners get up to sing karaoke
she didn't pick easy songs either
she sang celine's my heart will go on and whitney's saving all my love
she was actually pretty good
it was just unexpected
random karaoke aside
ayce definitely makes me a fan of this place
the service is friendly and the food is very good
i just wish it wasn't so far from my house
okay so we went while at ces and they were pretty busy that night however it took mins for them to come back to my table to see if i needed anything and i actually needed water
we also asked for a goat dish and they made it with lamb instead
the food was pretty good however not as refined as my fave amber india in the bay_area
the owner sang
however i wish she were singing indian music because i really dont care for mrs dion
i might try it again because i think service was off due to ces
but i reserve a star because i am not completely sold
yelpers seem to be very disappointed with origins but they are next on my list
any other indian recommendations
so far i think mantra might be my fave
stellar
the food is authentically awesome
melke
the new owner is the sweetest little thing
she even sing you some some songs as you dine
i recently landed back in vegas and had zero groceries in the fridge
we decided based upon proximity to pop into namaste for a regular ol' meal
boy was i surprised with the warm reception
great entertainment and fantastic chow
i actually felt_like i went on a little vacation it was such a great escape
victor and the rest of the crew are real kind and fun as well
thanks guys for making that and numerous times since then a wonderful experience
stopped in namaste for an extended lunch the other day with a date
after striking up a convresation
melque the
new
owner serenaded us for a full set
what a treat
she checked on us frequently and talked with us quite a bit about her home of goa
india
food is lighter and fresher than some other spots in town
consistently good and the buffet is frequently replenished
great value considering the price
what i love most about this place
besides the ultra convenient central location
is the dark
sultry wood decor
i treasure the places in vegas that don't feel like vegas
and namaste fits the bill
the energy in the place is authentic
and i came out feeling strangely rejuvenated and refreshed
i thought it was just lunch
fantastic food
after reading the reviews i thought i would give this restaurant a try
what a gem
this has to be one of the best indian food dining experiences i've had
all dishes ordered were delicious
we missed the lunch buffe where we could have tasted more dishes but we did experience different entrees
service was attentive and friendly
melque
the owner and entertainer
she has a lovely voice
made our dinner quite memorable
we will go back
small local restaurant
but cheap price
good food
and lovely owner sing a song for you
this was really a treat
the owner is warm and willing to discuss the menu in detail
she planned a meal for me and my wife that was really delicious some of the best lower priced indian i've had
wonderful veggie curry and a brihani my wife couldn't get enough of
highly_recommended
i went with a friend on a thursday night and it was dead
the service_was_prompt and the food was great
i recommend the somosas
tandoori sampler and garlic_naan
the food was pretty good
the lady owner was really nice
she also sang karaoke while we were eating
price is great
namaste's food
whether buffet or dinner plates
is consistently some of the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
this was our first venture dining away from the strip it was a huge success
truly this was one of the best indian food experiences of my life
second only to restaurants in singapore
fresh
complex
delicious ingredients prepared with care
the breads were outstanding
the vegetarian_dishes were superb
and the whole meal was cheap
win
awesome place
we stopped in last_night and after deciding to try something new
this place hit_the_spot and they were also having an
open mic
night
which was kinda weird in a cool sort of way
the owner melque was really nice and she recommended some dishes for us
our waiter rob was really great and personable
toward the end of our meal
melque got up and sang a song
overall this place was great
the lunch buffet is great
the dinner is pricey and the portions are a little too small
the lunch buffet never leaves me unsatisfied and never breaks my wallet
great food
i finally found an indian_restaurant_in_vegas after years of being here
it was kind of funny actually i got a groupon for this restaurant and finally was able to use it
it was saturday_night and when i walked in this little indian woman was singing
i will always love you
i didn't expect that but she has a great voice
then as soon as she was finished with the song she said that a belly_dancer would be out shortly
it was kind of funny this whole night of entertainment when i had only expected to find a mediocre restaurant with mediocre food
my friend ordered this awesome soup spinach and chicken i think
yummy
our main_dishes were lamb_vindaloo and chicken_tika_masala
they were both so delicious
the nan was fresh and fluffy
the owner
the singer
came by to see how we were doing
and because i was so impressed with the food i wanted to hug her
we got to talking and she was really nice that she made me decide on the spot that not only would it be one of my favorite restaurants
but all my friends favorite too
can't_wait_to_go_back
pretty good food
friendly_staff
food here is great
whether it be the lunch buffet or dinner menu
not too fond of the evening singer they have at the restaurant
but food is great
hands_down
this is absolutely the best_indian_food_i_have_ever had anywhere
i would highly_recommend anyone that reads this review to go here and eat
order the paneer shashlik as your appitizer
you_will_not_be_disappointed
yep
i have visited namaste twice within the last six months
both times for dinner
outside of it being in commercial center
a relatively seedy side of vegas
this restaurant rocks
the interior of the location is very dark and ominous and absolutely perfect for a romantic evening
we were greeted_by the owner who was an energetic as possible
our drink_orders were placed and delivered within a short amount of time and then the waiter assisted us with our dining options
we decided upon a lamb josh
garlic_naan and the butter_chicken
i have had butter_chicken before
but none as succulent as this
this was very fragrant
juicy and just downright delicious
it has to be some of the best butter_chicken i have ever had
hands_down
the lamb was also very tasty and was not heavy at all
the naan was also very good
very few restaurants make you want to try everything on their menu at least once
this is that place
the food is addictive and when coupled with the ambiance of the location
it just made it a downright special place to go
i would highly_recommend this plae to family and friends
we were visiting_vegas from out of town for the weekend and yelp_reviews point us to namaste
this place is great
the food
service and owner singer are absolutely fabulous
the owner and staff are happy to recommend items on the menu for those that aren't so familiar_with_indian_food
all recommendations were delicious
every time we are in town
we will dine at namaste
first indian place i have been to in las_vegas and i was excited
i had read the reviews_on_yelp and was anxious to try the place out
you walk in and immediately you are succumb to a dark
woody
quiet environment
it is calm
soothing and relaxing
the booths were nice and big and very comfy
i deducted a star because as an american
i should always have the option to american drinks
no tea
no lemonade
no soda
water or lassi seemed to be our only option and i was disappointed in that
the food was good
not great
i have had definately had better indian food
i was extremely happy that they had butter_chicken but in my opinion it should have been a little more creamier
the tandori_chicken didn't seem authentic either
so that was big a no for me
the naan
wasn't the freshest or softest i have had either
maybe it was the day we went but i felt they should have had more variety for chutneys
the buffet itself was a bit pricey for the amount of different choices they offered
i did like most of what i had
very filling
ate one and half plates
no indian people eating there either
that should have been my number one sign
i would go back maybe
really wonderful place and amazing food
the owner is so authentic
and you cant help to feel the care and love she puts in the dishes and each customer is so important to her
the restaurant is very clean and cozy too
so nice to be in a tranquil enviroment in las_vegas
even though it is in that crazy strip_mall
you are transported and only are reminded as you head to your car
try the samoas
tikka_marsala
chicken soup
and dont miss the garlic nann
no doubt we will be back
big thanks to groupon
to help to have us check it out
it is a homerun
om namah shivaya
namaste owner melque rodrigues is the hardest working woman in the las_vegas restaurant business
she greets customers
seats them
serves them
sings for them
you gotta hear her whitney houston and ella fitzgerald
then rings up their
affordable
check
she
alone
is reason enough to visit the indian restaurant
but there are many others
including a relaxing atmosphere
booths
mood lighting
dark wood floors and walls
convenient location
in historic commercial center
just east of the strip
and delicious food
start with the lamb_chops and move on to the aloo_gobi
skip the overpriced
overrated and impersonal restaurants on the strip and in the 'burbs and visit this independent up and comer
food was mediocre
we were forced to listen to karaoke and it took forever to get our change
on the upside
the lady was super_nice
p
s
do not order the lamb sagwaala unless you like salsa
sadly
i have to withdraw my previously positive review and add my recent unpleasant experience
previously
i had only visited for the lunch buffet
which is good and reasonably_priced
dinner is a different story
i purchased a groupon because i have always enjoyed this place
except
of course
the owner's occasional need to karaoke
can someone tell her that she is too loud and not whitney houston
we attempted to go there two weeks_ago
but the roof had a flood
we spoke with the owner for a few minutes
we walked in at pm and there was still a three foot by four foot puddle on the floor
she rents the space
but why not clean it up
so
we returned there last_night to try again
the food was good
not great and the rice was sparse
so
when we asked for our left_overs to go
we asked if we could get a little more rice to take home with us
there was an additional charge on the bill for rice
this was the big_deal
she wrote in an tip on the overall bill
now
i would have completely understood if she wrote a quick note on the side with the calculations for
and tip on the total bill
but to write in the tip on a table for two just because we were using a groupon is uncalled for
my friend
who was paying the difference
was so mad
so crossed it off and gave her a tip
lastly
when the owner is serving me
i feel less bad about the tip considering that is not how she makes her wages
unlike normal wait_staff
the bf and i have been watching a lot about indian food lately so we're on a kick for some
i've had this bookmarked for a long time and wanted to see what the fuss is about
when we walked in
the owner was belting out some tunes so we just waited for her to finish to get our drinks in
i'm filipino so i've been disenfranchised and subjected to a lot of karaoke
some people might like the entertainment
but fair warning that if you're not keen on it
you might catch one song but not a whole performance
we did the buffet for
i also ordered a mango_lassi
good but standard
the spread was decent
with chicken dishes
or so veggie dishes
salad
chutneys raita
naan
rice
spongy little cakes
dont know the name
potato pakora
rice_pudding and oranges for sweets
we both thought it was decent
but this is not our favorite lunch buffet
the standout for me was the saag which had a nice gingery flavor and creamy texture and the refreshing rice_pudding
i wish the naan wasn't premade and was fresh made as some of them were really crunchy for sitting out
the flavors were good
but i don't like that some of the items were precut bagged vegetable mix and they were doing their supply order while we were there and it confirmed what was frozen and what was not
i know times aren't the best for businesses
but fresh vegetables is one of the reasons why i'm drawn to indian food
i would say it was a
star buffet
i'll round up as the service was very warm
friendly_and_attentive and the atmosphere is nice
i just don't think i will be coming that often when we both have a love for a place we know uses better quality_ingredients and we built a repoire with already
love_this_place
melque is absolutely adorable and makes every visit that more special with her warmth
the food is to die for
hands_down best indian_cuisine i've had
a group of us went here before going to a show
the food was average
but the best part of the evening was when the waitress put down her tray and started singing a karaoke version of
i will always love you
the key change was hilarious and she belted it like she was celine or something
best part was
it is next to lotus of suam which is far better in quality
star for good curries
star for ambiance
star for clean rest room
i have taken stars off for
hard basmati_rice
and the service
also heard the waiter and the owner quarreling over some leaves that the waiter wanted to take but was denied
food is amazing
went with another and ordered the namaste special meat option for
and it was more then enough for the both of us
the waitress owner was more then kind
and even sang for us
quite the multi tasker
the flavoring was exceptional
and the lassi was good and thick
stars
this is going to be short and sweet
the food was amazing and the owner lovely and genuine
not bad food
the karaoke though was a bit much and ruins any conversation you may be trying to have w a friend
the lady singing looks like an indian halle berry
swear
oh_yeah
the area of town its in
don't reccomend it late at night
kinda weird crowd in the parking_lot
before making a visit to namaste
i have never tried indian and had no particular interest in it
since i was on vacation i thought that i could give it a try and i was not disappointed
i would just like to say that this food is really hit_or_miss because to an average person a lot of the food generally tastes the same with the addition subtraction of meats and veggies
the food did look a bit unappetizing but once you get started
you will find yourself in a bloated bliss
did not have the runs
this place is in a horrible neighbor hood
so if you choose to go here
then do get a cab or car
we walked there and felt very insecure
place is dark and dingy
i didnt have the courage to try the restrooms
horrible food
pathetic ambience
we went there for a sunday buffett
they were clearly not prepared
their food containers were half full
may be it was left over food from saturday
in fact
when one of the vegetables was over
i asked them to get more
they put water in it and got it back
bread service was slow and poor
save your money
don't go here
try something more popular on the strip
just had the lamb josh and lamb_vindaloo
both were amazing
the highlight of the night was the panner shashlik
simply amazing
a great night
we will certainly be back
its a mission to find an indian restaurant that has good food
good service
and good value at dinner time
indian food is generally enjoyed at their self serve lunch_buffets
but i had a craving for some curry at pm
i have to say i have never received such poor service in my life
the waiter wasn't rude 'per se' but his way of speaking was very condescending
every question or comment we had he rolled his eyes or had something very short to say
cleanliness no
the person i was dining with dropped their napkin on the floor on their way to the bathroom
an indian woman who appeared_to_be either the owner or the manager proceeded to pick_it_up
off the floor
and place it on top of our table
where we will eat
i was absolutely disgusted and demanded another napkin
the lamb we ordered was such poor quality
it was very gamy and was overcooked and dry
we ordered plain and garlic_naan
the garlic_naan had good flavor but they were both overcooked and almost crispy
i can't remember what our nd entree was but it obviously wasn't worth remembering
good ratings mean nothing to me if the food quality
and especially cleanliness
isn't there
eat somewhere_else
decent place
i really liked there garlic_naan
also
there butter_chicken had great flavor
those were the choices i got from the yelp_reviews
wanted to try the sashlik but it was made out of cottage_cheese so maybe i'll try next time when i'm in the mood
got the meat appetizer also
it was ok
i'd probably be back for the naan and the butter_chicken
this is a very unique indian restaurant in las_vegas
the ambiance is very pleasant and relaxing
we were greeted with a very warm welcome and introduced to some of their specials
we ordered the lamb_vindaloo
butter_chicken
garlic_naan and vegetables biriani
it was all very delicious and nicely presented
melque's singing was a plus to the dining_experience
she sang from her heart and has a soulful voice
the lunch buffet here is also very reasonably_priced and offers a wide selection
this is definitely one of my favorite indian_restaurants
first off the owner has an amazing voice
and if you talk to her enough you can get her to sing you a song
the buffet has a nice selection of both vegetarian and non vegetarian foods
they lose a star in some of the food being over seasoned
i do deduct a star for not having the best naan which i think is essential to indian_cuisine
still it was an enjoyable experience there and the service is great
i would honestly give this
stars
we've only had the lunch buffet and their fresh nan_bread is amazing
the butter_chicken was very flavorful and rich
saag_paneer had firm paneer chunks and chicken tandori was juicy
they had a decent amount of selection and the food was warm hot
the lady that was serving us was nice and friendly
my only problem with this place is that they put a lot of cream into the buffet
a trick used get customers full faster
and you can feel that when you're done eating
their masala chai was very bland as well and just tasted like plain tea
in all until i try their dinner menu i'm not overly impressed with this place but i have to say their nan_bread is one of the best ever and we will go back just for that
i have only been here for lunch
they have a great lunch buffet
naan is fresh and tandori_chicken is tasty
service was above_average and attentive
the price is reasonable and i'll return again for lunch
considering the casual ambiance
i don't think i would consider this place for a night out of indian food
by all means
check out the lunch buffet for a quick
tasty indian meal
we went to namaste and took a friend who was visiting_vegas
he had been several times to india
we are big fans of indian food and we all loved this place
we ordered off the menu
even though it was lunch time
buffet available
and had just a lovely meal
i had the lamb_vindaloo
which was amazing
some of the best i've had
but not like any i've had before
this one had a very unique flavor
more tomato taste and quite lovely
chicken_tiki_masala was also incredible
but i think the best thing was the house specialty shrimp
the naan was good and soft and hot
melque
the owner
even treated us to two songs
i will dine at namaste again
a lot
loved it
go for the lunch buffet
stay for the great service
the spread was pretty decent
with a couple chicken dishes and lots of vegetarian_options
the tandoor chicken was juicy
surprising for a buffet
but my favorite was probably the cabbage
i also enjoyed the chutneys and the dessert
pass on the plain mango lahsee
the butter_chicken was ok
but i like a really creamy chicken with legs and thighs not chicken_breast
i'm convinced white people want white_meat and complain so that's why it's made with breast
but what do i know anyway
this is so far the tastiest indian food i have had in las_vegas
i'm not sure if dinner will ever happen because for now
the lunch buffet is a great price to try a few different dishes
great place for a quick
easy lunch for great and tasty indian food
from one end of the buffet to the other
the lunch menu offered great tasting food
great food always starts with fresh_ingredients
and the freshness in nasmaste's food really shines through
the owner was super pleasant and really a pleasure to speak with
i would definitely recommend_this_place_to_anyone looking for delicious food
indian or otherwise
i'm actually not a fan
but i loved the food
the restaurant has a nice clean look that is soft and comfortable
the service was great too
this review is for their_lunch_buffet
i came in around pm after a day at the korean spa
they are open from
pm
pm for lunch and then reopen at pm for dinner
yet again i almost missed out on a solid place because i was going to walk out
first glances can be deceptive
especially when you walk into an empty restaurant in the middle of lunch hours
i decided to stay anyways due to all the high reviews of this place
i cannot say that yelp has lead me astray
the lunch buffet is smaller than other restaurants and does not offer saag
i was disappointed to see that their paneer is without the homemade cheese cubes
i did enjoy their butter_chicken and aloo_gobi though
in the beginning
i was counting all of my favorite items that was missing
but after a few bites i was enjoying what they did offer
unlike other places
the items in the warmers were kept piping_hot
nothing was lukewarm
the fried potatoes retained a crispiness that is normally unheard of in buffets
overall i was impressed with how attentive the owner was
she cleared plates
refilled my water
and checked up on me frequently
i overheard her conversation about the restaurant having a tough time
but she doesn't let it show in the quality of the food
i hope their business picks up
because it is a solid option for those not too familiar with indian or someone who loves butter_chicken
which i don't see too often on the line
this review is for dinner service and not the lunch buffet
we dined here saturday_night and overall experience was enjoyable
the restaurant was fairly empty
two other tables occupying the space
which was slightly worrisome
our server was also the owner and she was pleasant and sweet
we started_off_with a bottle of cabernet and two appetizers
chicken pakoras and vegetable_samosas
i was not particularly impressed with either
but out of the in our party enjoyed both
our entrees were following
butter_chicken
very good
saag_paneer
nothing special
goan shrimp_curry
my favorite out of our choices
exceptionally good
lamb_tikka_masala
also good
chicken_vindaloo
did not try
but rest of the party enjoyed
we also had four orders of garlic_naan which seemed a little too crispy for my liking
although not perfect
the food and service here are well above par
i will definitely be returning to sample more of their menu and of course indulge in more goan shrimp_curry
went in here for dinner with a friend and was pleasantly_surprised
i tried the buffet in order to maximize my dinner with different options
everything tasted great
the butter_chicken and the chicken curry were both my favorite
the owner was very pleasant and helpful in explaining things to me
with it being my first time eating indian food
it was definitely a good dining_experience and with the food being so delicious i will_definitely_go_back
it made me a little sad to eat here because i really had to go out of my way and into a shady area to experience some lame food
at least the service was good and the owner is pretty funny and charismatic
so
the food
i was here specifically for the lunch buffet
i'm sure if it was bustling full of people it wouldn't be as lame
it was clearly just sitting there
it had a film over the top
usually most places at least stir the food around to avoid this effect
so
the stale food was just ok
nothing special
i'm sure it would be a little better fresh
and a lot better with more than a handful of items to pick from
i can't_speak for made to order items during dinner
but definitely avoid this place for lunch
it just isn't worth it
one of the best indian_restaurants we've eaten at in the vegas area
we went here for our anniversary
and the food was good and the atmosphere was fun
we went there on a sep long weekend
the interior is ok
but the food is amazing
we had a chat with the owner she was really nice
she is an amazing singer
she even dedicated a song for us
we were there for nights so night before this we had dinner in gandhi's which is good to but this is better
and the customer_service is amazing
will definitely recommend it
ahhn and if you plan to go try the malai dish it is delicious
little expensive though
of us ate here and thoroughly_enjoyed melque's advice on what to order
the food was amazing
what we weren't expecting was also her entertainment
she sang so richly while we ate
what a treat
i highly_recommend eating here
delicious
we will return
i stand by my belief that i hate buffets
but
if you make a buffet that is compact
meaning small and only consisting of delicious dishes
steps from where i am sitting and slap a
price tag on it
then you and i can dance
namaste's lunch buffet is all those things
this is a small restaurant
so no matter where you are sitting
you are close to the action
the naan_bread is fresh out of the oven and worth the brief wait so it comes out piping_hot and delicious
my favorite
as is true of most indian_restaurants
was the butter_chicken
the only con is that there were no samosas on the bar but
frankly
much like sushi
samosas are never good on a buffet anyway
the little lady who is running this place is maybe the cutest little thing ever
i wanted to put her in my pocket and take her home with me
which is made even weirder by the fact that i am maybe an inch taller than her haha
so nice and genuine and you can really tell she takes pride in her place
she told my friend and i that she sings nightly
wish the neighborhood were close to my home so i could stop in here for dinner sometime and check it out
but no doubt
i'll be hitting up this lunch buffet again soon
i'd been to namaste several times for dinner and once for lunch in the past
but it had been far too long of a lapse from going
decided to go for lunch today since i'm still embarked on
las_vegas indian lunch buffet tour
and inexplicably had not tried it in long enough to warrant a review
i was actually very impressed with the times i went to namaste for dinner
one of those occasions would have warranted a and the other a
so i should be ashamed of myself for not posting a review then and instead hitting them with a for today's lunch buffet
but that's exactly what i'm going to do
let me start off by saying service was fantastic
and the gentleman who seated us was very friendly and made sure my iced_tea stayed flowing
iced_tea was delicious by the way
it was one of those fruit flavored kinds which i'm not certain of
but very tasty nonetheless
and that there was always a plate of hot naan at the table
the first portion we received of naan was excellent
soft
fresh and with a great flavor
the nd plate was a little overcooked and therefore too crispy for my liking
but overall the naan was fine
as for the selections on the actual buffet
i was a tad disappointed
a minor gripe is layout wise the rice was at the end of the line
i think it works much better at the front so i can keep piling all the various curries and dals over the rice
instead of vice versa which is what i ended_up doing
as for the food itself
i was a big_fan of the saag
hooray for it not being saag_paneer like i normally find at buffets as i can't_handle the cheese
i also thought the potato pakora was delicious and unique to any pakora offerings i've had elsewhere
the chicken curry was a fine version
and the piece of chicken i ended_up with were very tender and flavorful
the rest of it was fairly average to me
it could just be a preference thing
but i found most of the other offerings to be very thin in consistency
almost soup like
while i guess i tend to prefer a thicker dal or curry with my rice
when i'd try to scoop a spoonful of most of these onto my plate
they immediately would go all over the entire plate and mix into everything else
if you've read my other reviews you know i generally like this when i eat indian food
but the point is i like to do it myself
to be the master of my own domain so to speak
generally i also just found the offerings limited compared to my favorite lunch_buffets mt_everest and mint
i'm a samosa fiend so not having those effects me
and namaste makes a fine version from what i've had at dinner
i would have also liked to see more meat offerings
they had chicken dishes
but were prepared in butter or yogurt so they were off limits to my sensitive
annoying tummy
it's quite possible i caught them on a day with a selection that just didn't suit my needs
but even if that's the case the fact that i've never caught everest or mint in that situation speaks volumes to me
myself and wife had visited vegas for
yes pure fun and stumbled on namaste indian_cuisine
it was the best food we had in vegas
the owner melque was so kind and attentive and always going out of way to make us feel comfortable
the food was of course amazing and me being vegan i was just amazed at the choices
so we decided to go back again before we left vegas for buffet and the food again was just excellent
everything was fresh and service always the best
to top off the wonderful food melque
the owner a professional singer
also sang some beautiful notes for us and made our lunch_special
so what can you ask more good food good music and good ambiance
we will surely be back when we are in vegas we miss you melque
and of course the wonderful food please open one in denver co and we will be your loyal customers
keep up the great service and food
sairam hiremagalur and sinduja raghavan
denver co
i was in las_vegas for a trip in the month of august with my friends
the lunch buffet was about to close in minutes when we walked in and i felt we were late for the lunch
the ambiance was ok and staff paid attention when we walked inside
the owner of the restaurant was also working along with restaurant staff
they have very limited number of items for the lunch buffet
the food in the containers was about to finish and we asked the waitress to get the food
i liked the curry with boiled eggs and it was perfect combination with naan's
the food is not so spicy and the price of the buffet was ok
i guess we shouldn't expect spicy indian food in a city like las_vegas
disappointing indian buffet
don't let the neighborhood fool you inside is warm and pleasant
the food is exceptional and if the owner makes a suggestion
take it you'll love it
super horrible indian restaurant to visit in vegas
the food is too pricy
the lady over there was too harsh and service was pathetic
i would never recommend_this_place
i wished to give them a zero but there is no option
i was visiting a friend
and he and his son took me for some indian_cuisine
as it turns_out it was the right place to go
while not being new to the indian flavor of food
namaste did offer some new twist on an otherwise stable menu
as always i tend to heed the suggestions for the own help
and not being afraid to try_new_things seem to always payoff
in my opinion
this is one of the better places for indian food
try it and enjoy
l
we went here for lunch on our trip_to_vegas and really enjoyed the food and found it to be authentic and tasty
the host was friendly and it seemed like a nice family_owned business
the naan was great
butter_chicken and saag was good
rice was a bit hard as it was left steaming for a long time and the kheer could have been much better
all in all a very nice meal
good food and nice service
the owner serves excellent food and then will sing to resteraunt patrons
if you are lucky
give it a go and you'll enjoy your indaian food escapade
i've been here once before and thought it was fantastic
this time we walked in and they pretty much told us we had to get the buffet
which i didn't even know was an option for dinner
we told her we had a groupon and she said they'd still take it
i think we appeared disappointed
so she encouraged us to check out the buffet and gave_us time to decide
the buffet had limited items but we were probably going to get chicken_tikka_masala or curry anyway and both were on the buffet
our groupon was set to expire in a week so we figured we better just use it
i think the owner sensed our hesitation and finally offered us the whole menu but she said it'd be a long wait for food nice they were getting busy
only the booths were occupied so it didn't seem busy but we decided to stick with the buffet option
we were pretty hungry
she also moved us to a different booth
both of which seemed dirty
very confusing
we were given a fresh basket of naan and our drinks
and on to the buffet
i think the chicken curry was the best thing on the buffet but was pretty picked through and there wasn't much left
tikka masala was kind of bland
i make better at home
the tandoori_chicken was good but we kept getting little broken bits of bone in the meat around the whole bone
i didn't really like their dal either
the entire time we were there workers kept walking back and forth with big sheets to set tables
aren't they closed after lunch to do this
we got there about so there couldn't have been that many people in and out that quickly
the waitress owner was very nice and apologetic throughout but the entire experience was strange
with all the good indian options in town
i doubt i'll go back
the lunch buffet is good
however
there are much better indian_buffets in town
i went the the restaurant for dinner using a groupon
i ordered the shrimp curry_house special and was very disappointed
the curry was ok
but the curry only contained small shrimp and cost nearly
the restaurant is simply not worth it for mediocre food
and it shows based_on the empty dinning room
if your in the area and not able to get into lotus
please try another restaurant in the complex
there are much better options than namaste
i like the lunch buffet
the owner is a nice genuine person who interacts with guest
wow
for an awesome lunch buffett
ask the hostess nicely and she will sing frank sinatra or whitney songs
try this place and you wont be disappointed
so sad
rolled up to a sign today that said closed indefinitely
i've only ever ordered a takeaway from here
i've never actually eaten in their restaurant itself
but this is without a shadow of a doubt my favourite indian takeaway spot in edinburgh
for starters
the food is great value their set meal for people includes chicken and vegetable_pakoras
any lamb or chicken curries and any naan and or rice for
but you wouldn't think it was that cheap to taste it
what's more
even on weekends the delivery is always quick
i've never waited more than half an_hour
and it's always piping_hot when it arrives
for me there's nothing worse than realising you're starving
ordering a takeaway
only to spend the next hour hour and a half pacing in front of the window wondering where the hell it is
you'll need to order from here at least half a dozen times before you can even begin to decide which is your favourite dish
mainly due to the huge variety on the menu
i'd highly_recommend the chicken chasni which is tandoori grilled
then cooked with ground nuts
chillies
green peppers
garlic and cream
it definitely hits the spot
it's not often i get takeaways
i'm really lazy and takeaways tend to guilt trip me into having to go to the gym the next day
but if you're going to get one then get it from here
from the outside
manna mahal doesnt look anything special just a simple and standard indian restaurant
nor does it look anything special on the inside
traditional looking and plain
however
how the restraunt looks isnt why i come here time and agin
it's the food
always well flavoured and good quality the food is simply outstanding its the equvalent of your mums home cooking
simple
delicious and morish
further more
they do it as a take away
and thats great as well
the food is also remarkably cheap
service in manna mehal isnt anything to write_home_about
but it isnt awful either
so there you have it
great food and a nice
if plain
setting to eat it in
as others have said
manna mahal doesn't_look_like the snazziest joint in the town
however don't judge a book
or an indian restaurant
by its cover
i first tasted what manna mahal had to offer when a takeaway
i was pleasantly_surprised
i came back again and sat in
this time i was a little less impressed
the food wasn't quite what i ordered and overall it didn't live up to me previous experience
this could have been a bad night because i have ordered takeaway again and it has been fine
the prices are really good
especially by edinburgh standards
and portions are a generous size
if you don't mind simple curry and simply decor and you like good indian food
check_this_place_out
i wouldn't recommend it for showing fancy dining
but for straight forward takeaway lazy night out
your on good ground
manna mahal is only a ten miute walk away from where i live in edinburgh and over the past year i've been here at least three times
the atmosphere inside is tranquil whilst the service is pleasant and fast as anthing
however
the food has to be the highlight of the restaurant
obviously
as it all tastes amazing and is surpsisingly cheap
the startes are mostly and the mains are only around each
i had the mutton coconut starter followed by the butter_chicken the last time i was in and the quality of the meat in both was outstanding
the sauce which the chicken was in had a great range of flavours and was amazingly creamy
i really like this place and recommend it without a doubt
don't be fooled
this food_court corner is run by the same fellas that do some major gourmet indian_cuisine in vegas and elsewhere
i was floored great food
definitely check out their one of a kind fried cauliflower dish
after a grueling day of shooting pool in the southwest challenge
i was pleased to find that the food_court at the riviera had an indian restaurant
at first
i thought i was hallucinating
but once the smell of the shahi_paneer and garlic_naan that i ordered hit my nose
i realized that this blissful little moment was actually taking place
the staff was friendly
excited even
over my obvious enthusiasm
i came back the next day and had the malai_kofta
also excellent
when i return for the national apa team championship in august
i will definitely be at india_masala
a couple of weeks_ago my husband and i went to a festival celebrating indian culture and food at the county building
while there
we sampled food from several indian_restaurants around town
and were most pleased with what we had at the booth of india_masala
which is permanently located in the riviera
for the first time we had dosa
a lentil and rice pancake crepe that is a typical dish of southern india
we happened to pick_up a postcard offering off our check so we decided to head to the riviera to see what else was being offered
it's no surprise that the riviera is on its last legs
and ranks up there with circus circus as being the most rundown hotel on the strip
we certainly worked up an appetite as we made the looooong walk from the parking garage to the food_court
next time i'd valet in the front of the casino
no
we weren't expecting indian masala to be a semi fast_food restaurant
but as it turns_out
it was
the prices aren't really justified considering this
but the food is really good and it was packed with more indians and convention attendees than any other tenant's space when we were there
see below
so we figured it was safe to stay
we had to wait about in line for five minutes and then another ten_minutes or so for our food
which was a bit frustrating
but i felt rewarded when i got my dosa
today i opted for one stuffed with spinach
the palak dosa
but you can also choose from a filling of chickpeas
chole
potatoes
masala
or no filling at all
plain
it is served with what i learned to be the traditional accompaniments
sambar
a vegetable soup
and coconut_chutney
imagine a thick and textured almond milk
there is also a third side that i can best describe as a pureed and spiced red bell pepper spread
the dosa is flavorful enough on its own
but the sauces add another dimension and were very much enjoyed
the dosa itself is delicate
with a browned
crisp exterior and a soft
lightly chewy interior
you can get a better idea of the textural difference when you order it plain
but the filling makes it a meal
i must say it's a dish that's growing on me
and i'd bear the pain of walking through that casino to enjoy another one day
my husband was less thrilled with his dish
but it seems to me that the emphasis here is on lesser known southern indian_cuisine so chicken_vindaloo
might not have been the best option
this vindaloo was flavorful but not nearly hot enough for ian who asked them to make it as spicy as possible
the larger problem was the color of the sauce
which was reminiscent of an artificially colored sweet and sour
the color should have been deeper and darker had it been a result of the spices
things that don't look natural probably aren't
so we'll just say this color most likely wasn't derived from where it should have been
if you are interested in trying a new kind of indian dish that isn't available at other restaurants around town
as far as i know
i would definitely recommend coming here for the dosa
i'd be willing to try a few other things but i think what i had was the most reasonably_priced for you what you get
and certainly the most unique
for location and atmosphere this place is star located in a bordering on skeezy food_court at the riviera
food is great however extremely decent
with some of the hugest and tastiest naan around
i wouldn't go here over most of the sit_down places_in_town
simply because i want some service and don't like food courts
but if you're trapped at the riviera this is infinitely better than the rest of the crap they serve up
it sure was depressing to see how the vast majority of people opted for lowest common denominator hamburgers and hot dogs over wonderful indian_cuisine
thank you sheila b
for piquing my interest
eric r
and i did a few hikes at valley of fire state park and headed back to vegas around pm starving
he asked me if i had anything bookmarked on the north strip
look at him
pretending to know everything about yelp
and i said india_masala at the riviera
haha we laughed i had never been to the riviera ever
we parked and wandered through the maze and there it was
in the food_court
i ordered a masala_dosa and eric got the tandoori combo
his came with naan
cilantro chutney
tandoori_chicken on the bone
chicken_tikka
chicken kabob
some other chicken seasoned
and daal
lentils
mine came with coconut and tomato chutneys and spiced tomato_soup
the meals were filling and tasty
i loved the chutneys
especially the cilantro
and it did its justice with my nose running
i would return for this
hidden_gem
why is this place the best_indian_food_in_vegas
well
because it is the only indian food i had in vegas
by default it wins
but it wins in other ways
its is fracking cheap
relatively speaking of course
the menu is quite huge and it puts the other guys in the food_court to shame
the service is pretty good and the wait time is decent considering the queue of customers and staff on hand
the food itself is a little heavy
which is to be expected
but otherwise really really really good
it was soo good that i had to have it twice during my weekend stay in town
if i ever find myself wishing i wasn't in the riviera casino
i know i'll be swinging by here to kill time as well as my time
the food here is amazing
we went with some friends that were visiting from out of town
and they loved it so much that we went twice in days
the best thing about this place is that the food is fresh and tasty and very close to homemade food
the masala_dosa is crisp and yummy
infact we had many people looking curiously at what this food was
the veg dishes including palak_paneer come with a naan and rice
our friends tried the tandoori combo which was very good as well as the fish_curry and goa chicken
the ambience is ok but the food is really good
it's a real shame this place is in the nasty old riviera
because it really is as good as everyone says
one of the things i hate about every other indian restaurant i've been to in vegas is that i always feel like i pay a lot and don't get a lot
well
not here
the portions are ginormous a great value
and the two dishes we ordered were fabulous
i can't_wait_to_go_back and try more
i just wish we didn't have to go to the riviera to do it
this would get stars if i didn't have to sit in a nasty food_court and eat their yummy food off of a paper plate
if you can get over that
though
do it
it's worth it i promise
butter_chicken
hmm
what to make of this place
it's indian food
in a food_court
in a strip hotel
ok so it's the riviera
but still
cutting to the chase
the butter_chicken was yummy
it had bell peppers in it
which stood_out for some reason
maybe because there usually aren't bell peppers in butter_chicken
idk
i liked what they brought to the party
the plate comes with a good amount of basmati_rice
and a ginormous piece_of_naan
in my book
it doesn't get much better than savoring some delicious butter_chicken sauce with some naan
so the food was good
but back to the place
the fact that we even have indian food in a food_court in this town makes me happy
the down side is that you're paying more for it
like i said
it's in a strip hotel
albeit the riviera
they're probably paying a lot for that location
so their prices are naturally higher
i mean
for a plate of butter_chicken isn't insane
but it just feels weird because you're in a freakin' food_court
in any case
i left satisfied
i wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again
but i'd consider it if i'm ever back in the riviera
like the next time i watch some roller derby
p
s
i pretty much always order mango_lassi if they offer it
i've had better
but it was pretty good
one hella restaurant
not sure why are they stuck inside riviera
do not underestimate the quantity
for me and my friend who skipped breakfast and went straight to lunch we could not finish the thali non_veg and tandoori
butter_chicken
friendly_staff
limited seating in the common area in the outside food_court
vegetable_samosas with a delicious and refreshing spicy cilantro sauce to complement both the samosa and the tamarind_sauce that comes with it too
the palak_paneer is so delicious and not too over spiced or under seasoned and it's accompanied with a large naan_bread that has been warmed on the grill along side a bed of soft fluffy fragrant jasmine rice
my mouth is watering already
this place is indeed a hidden_gem in the culinary world of the strip
it's in the riviera casino's food_court
who would of known
i just happened to had walked inside with hunger and the scent of indian home cookery led me to this fabulous place
if you are hungry
the servings are enough for to share
and are on a budget
but not in a palate budget
then come over for some darn delicious food
plus
the staff was so calm
patient and helpful
i will come here again on my next trip_to_vegas
fast
friendly service
big portioned tasty food
drawback
plastic utensils
this place is a modest great place to eat some quick indian food
very tasty
very reasonaable
their aloo_tikki chat is one of my fav
my only prob with them is their limited menu and their south_indian isn't all that great
all said i liked eating there for my stay there
so out of stars
what a hidden_gem
as good as the food is
india_masala should consider a full restaurant
we had the famous vegetable_samosa to start with
and the chicken_tikka_masala and masala_dosa was very well seasoned and freshly_made with a over sized piece_of_naan
jasmine rice also comes with the tikka masala
the food is delicious and they give you plenty of it
the staff was friendly
seating_area is limited since its a food_court
the prices are a bit high for indian food in a food_court but after eating here it was well worth it
i had their vegetarian combo two days in a row
it did taste really good
it was spicy enough for me
i wouldn't mind even if it was a bit more spicy
i love spicy food
the only downside was they had almost the same item in the combo on both days except one dish
the naan was too thin and a bit crisp for my taste
i also tasted dosa which was really good
i would love to come back to this place next time i am in vegas
yum
went here with misti y last_night before the roller derby event and was really impressed
their naan
included with entree
comes out big
savory and soft with lots of air pockets
and the chef's recommendation of 'medium hot' spice for my entree was pretty perfect
i got the chicken_tikka_masala
and look_forward to trying the vegetable_korma next time
while waiting for my order
i wandered down the food_court to check out the other vendors and happened upon the india_masala gaylord india mini truck parked outside i had no idea that the rio hotel's gaylord india restaurant was related to this food_court satellite
makes me want to try gaylord india as well
and
while we were waiting we ran into a cool elite yelper couple that misti had never met in person
india_masala is open late
past am
and curiously the late_night menu is smaller but more expensive by
i guess they kind of have a monopoly on masala after pm on the strip
stars
if my dish were or instead of
i would give india_masala stars in a heartbeat
my current late_night fix has been pm happy_hour sushi
if we can figure_out how to park close to the india_masala mini truck i think this could be a solid afterparty spot
joining the likes of soyo
herbs rye
satay
slidin' thru hq and bazic
we needed our indian fix and yelped this place
be warned it is in an old casino food_court
the people were nice and the huge skinny piece of naan_bread made up alittle for the
tag on the chicken_tika_masala
the sauce was kinda greasey and runny like soup but you get a plate full
the spiciness was sharp and harsh
for a food_court ot was good and only ok for a restaurant
i took the suggestions and had the dosa masala
i also added some vegetable_pakoras
and they were all very good
very tasty
well prepared
very much worth the price
i like to judge ethnic food by how many people of that ethnicity are actually present at the restaurant when i am there eating
its safe to say that the indian community is well aware of india_masala and are pleased with the food that is presented there
that to me
is a sign of a winner
good india food with a fast_food concept
its located inside the riviera hotel and was the only good option for lunch
the food tastes good and is reasonably_priced for vegas
the quantity deserves a special mention too
stop by for a quick tasty bite
shockingly good
was actually staying at this hotel and lo and behold really good indian food downstairs
it was very authentic and tasty
definitely recommended if you happen to need indian food after a night of partying
visited india_masala last weekend after looking for good india food on yelp
the food
hit_the_spot
was very authentic and i guess the best indian food i ever had in vegas
it is located in riviera's food_court
not the best place in vegas
but the good food compensates for the ambience
stars for food
ambience
i would definitely go again
found this place around midnight on a saturday
there was only one guy working there
so my chicken curry and samosas order took about minutes
well worth_the_wait
cost about bucks but was plenty for people
this was by far the best curry i have had in the states
let alone vegas
it beat out all other fancy indian joints by far
only thing it was a notch too spicy for me
and i love hot food
i highly recomend this diamond in the rough
after misti y
's hall monitor cmye
a few of us decided to walk across to the riviera for some india_masala action
its location is kinda odd being part of a food_court than a free standing restaurant
their menu is pretty extensive
offering curries
dosas
and vegetarian items as well
i split the tandoori grill combo with the wifey and the portions were pretty generous
but the price
was pretty steep for a food_court entree
taste is everything and every bite was delicious as was the naan and chutneys that came with our order
we don't frequent indian dining spots as much
because my stomach is craving goyemon most of the time
but i'd like to return to try their other items
aloha
yelp challenge
namaste
the last dosa place we went to in vegas charged us around for rice
so we came here looking for a new dosa spot and weren't disappointed
the dosa was all that it should be
and the coconut_chutney was light and refreshing
my fiancee is obsessed with coconut_chutney
so he didn't even bother with the tamarind_chutney
i had an order of naan
and ate it with the sabar
just had lunch somewhere_else
the best part for me was the mango_lassi
it's just the way i like it
which is not overly sweet
i'd go back just for the lassi
my fiancee will return for another dosa
def rec
its located in food_court area of rivera
there r other good indian options on strip
i prefer tamba over this
indian masala is probably the only place that serves good south_indian food in las_vegas
the food is good and is worth the money
look no further for the best indian food on the strip
not like there was fierce competition
it's pretty interesting that it popped up at the food_court of the riviera of all places
i'm still trying to figure_out why it's here
do guests of the riviera have a strong fever that can only be satiated with tremendous curry flavors
all i see are old people playing slots
it doesn't matter though
i'm just glad it's here and it's tremendous
not only do they have every curry you could want but they serve a lot of south_indian dishes most places don't
i only wished i was hungrier when i came to try more things
we ended_up ordering the tandoori combo which included different meats and the saag_paneer accompanied_by orders of naan
everything was delicious and i can't_wait_to_go_back and try more menu_items
the two reasons for no star_rating are the location
hate the parking garage
and the price which is a couple extra dollars more than other places
there are too many indian options off the strip for lunch at better price points and they're all_you_can_eat
still
it doesn't take away from how good their food is
i can't believe i actually have a reason to go to the riviera now
very good indian food
highly_recommended than other options on the strip
though located in a food_court within riviera casino
the food is tasty and worth the buck
best dish was shahi_paneer
it was desi dhaba style
enough quantity for both me and my wife
their naan's were nice and crispy
south_indian food was decent
nothing good or bad about it
for the few days we stayed on the strip
we went here couple_of_times and it was worth it
service was quick and good
i think the location makes this place a little less popular and unknown to the crowd
if you have a car or any other means to get here
i think its totally_worth it though
you can avoid the crowds and have some nice indian food here
the food is one of the worst i had in a long time
curd or yogurt in my papdi chaat was so sour and the potatoes ice cold
i just ended_up throwing it off in garbage
easily some the best naan you'll ever taste
it's too bad that not many folks will ever find this gem in its hidden location in the riviera
the riviera food_court has absolutely no ambience
but if you like indian the food is very good
best_indian_food_in_vegas
always lines of people waiting
but the wait is so worth it
its made fresh and trust_me you can taste it
i dont know what my favorite is
because theres so much
must try
based_on the looks and location of this place
you would never guess how good it is
i went there with two relatives who were visiting from southern india and we all loved the food
the dishes were deliciously authentic and the portions were very generous
the tandoori_chicken plate we ordered was cooked_to_perfection
i also recommend the masala_dosa
it's a great little gem that i can't_wait_to_go_back to next_time_i'm_in_vegas
let me start off by saying
i only went to this place because of the reviews i read on yelp
definitely not disappointed
i truly would have never found this place if it were not for yelp
and probably even if i did
i would have been reluctant to try it since it is in a food_court
if you are going to india_masala it is for nothing else but good food
i mean who says i am going to the food_court to eat dinner
other than maybe high school kids
prices were a bit pricey for a food_court but it is in a hotel on the strip
however
to my surprise i had more than enough food and could hardly finish my meal
i paid about
for a butter_chicken
spicy
meal with rice
naan and soda
i definitely was not disappointed
you wait a little longer for your food than we would be accustomed to in a food_court setting but my food was fresh and oh so good
i am literally salivating now just thinking about it
my only set back was i had one little piece of lemon grass that was too big so when i bit into it it was not fun for me
good sign for me is when i see native people eating their own food
there is nothing worse than going to an ethnic place to eat and you do not see any people of their own kind there
best naan in town
hands_down
this is definate must try for any indian food lovers
you can not be disappointed
it is definate return and new fave for me
located in the corner of the food_court at the riviera
easy to miss
but well worth the search
the workers were very friendly
helpful and patient
excellent service
i ordered the chicken_vindaloo
requested extra_spicy
and my friends ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
both dishes come with rice and naan
both come out to after tax
both plates give large portions relative to all other indian cuisines i've been to
chicken_vindaloo
kinda spicy
i had hoped for spicier
but oh well
i loved it
they use dark meat from the chicken and don't skimp out on your portion
the potatoes could've been better prepared
it was a little hard or undercooked maybe
the sauce was amazing and very well spiced
rice was okay
no comments there
the naan was great and fluffy
and it was pretty heavily glistened with butter
chicken_tikka_masala
i tasted some of my friend's tikka masala and i thought it was also really good
definitely one of the best plates i've had for indian_cuisine
it was reasonably spicy and spiced perfectly
not many other comments since i only tasted it
my hour drive back in traffic was terrible
not because of the traffic
but because everytime i thought about the chicken_vindaloo i had
my mouth would salivate
heavily
hell
even as i write this review
i'm practically drooling
next_time_i'm_in_vegas
i'm definitely coming_back here
what a great surprise in a food_court
a little expensive
but the best food available in the riviera hotel
healthy and full of flavor
not bad for indian fast_food
food was fresh
hot
tasted really good
and the serves are big
their dosa and sambar is very good
their butter_chicken was done right and the naan served with the combo plates was huge and delicious
it is in the riviera food_court so seating was limited during their busy hours and the seating_area was a little dirty
will eat from here again next time im in town but might take it to go and eat it in the comfort of my timeshare
i regretted not trying out india_masala the last time i was at the riviera
an indian restaurant in a food_court
i didn't really trust it
but a couple days later i saw it on yelp with plenty of good reviews
so when i finally headed back to the riviera a few months later to check out roller derby
i knew where my dinner stop would be
the menu is large and has plenty of vegetarian_options
we were starving and not sure how large the servings would be so we went a little crazy
we got an order of saag_paneer
vegetable_korma
and a masala_dosa
the saag and korma both came with a side of rice and naan
while the dosa came with two chutneys
the dosa came out first and was huge
i know dosas are large
but i'm pretty sure i could have thrown the thing in lake mead and rode it around like a boat
it was full of potatoes
peas
and lentils and had a nice samosa taste to it
i was so hungry that i completely forgot about my chutneys and didn't try them at all
boo
the saag was good
but lacking a depth of flavor i get at mint and origin
it wasn't bad
but considering the price was the same i'd rather eat at one of those two restaurants
the vegetable_korma was also good but looked a little different from others i've had
this one was more red in color
instead of yellow
and had a smoky taste to it
the sides of rice were large and you get a piece_of_naan the size of your plate
i love naan
but this one was a little boring for me
plus one came out nice and doughy while the other was overcooked and had a crunch to it
we also ordered a mango_lassi and it was undrinkable
the consistency was too thin and almost tasted like spoiled yogurt
it went in the trash
in all
this place is good and i would come back if we were at the riviera
but the prices_are_pretty ridiculous to me considering they are in a food_court
isn't the point of a food_court to get cheap grub instead of paying the extra money to sit_down somewhere
their appetizers
samosas and such
were about while the dosa was about
i knew the dosa was more food and therefore a better deal so that's why we ordered it instead of an appetizer
entrees were around while combo platters were around
very good options and tasty food
i have tried them for the first time and i love it
only place i found to have south_indian food without buffet
i am definitely going there again and did i mention its
d
awesome
and late late late
sitrep
hot dam
what a find when wandering along las_vegas blvd at am
menu
lv yelper paolo had recommended the butter_chicken
naan
rice
all good
and this particular dish tends to be my
litmus test
for different places from seattle to sacramento to l
a
and now vegas
and i have to say it was de lish
price yikes
but the combo was about after tax and tip
with this and something that i would consider to be very pricey if at home or work
however
this was my vegas trip and in most situations while traveling
i won't spare the expense for the experience
the lowdown
a great find in vegas for indian_fare
with it's hidden location inside the riviera hotel
you would never know about it unless you
yelp
ed it
on a search for great indian food
my dear friend and fellow yelper found this place doing a yelp search for food in town
neither one us had been there before so we figured why not
what the hey
i can't believe it's hours
that's epically fabulous
the food served mild still had kick and flavour
and the service was fabulous
served fresh piping_hot
you have to wait a bit to get your order but if it means it's 'cooked to serve'
i'll take it
headed back to vegas tomorrowand you can be sure i am attempting to make a stop at the riviera just for my masala fix
excellent
the veggie_samosas were spot on
big
crispy on the outside
nice potatoes and spices on the in
butter_chicken was nice
a little tart
aromatic
sweet
chicken moist
very nice dish
the portions are huge
naan_bread is cooked_perfectly
crisp
soft
chewy
rating the indian food was good
but not great
but it was a treat to get any indian food in that food_court
had the channa dosa
while good and very filling
it was a bit one dimensional
when i asked for it spicy
the handed me these generic hot_sauce packets that tasted like tabasco sauce
yuck
the chutneys that accompanied the dosa were pretty bland and generic too
but
as we are staying here for a convention this week and it's outside
would be willing to try some other dishes next time
visited india_masala two more times during our stay at the riviera
it's still about
star experience
but i rounded up for the following
owner was very nice and helpful and told me that if i wanted spicy
just ask for extra chilies
which i did and it was much better than cheap o packages of hot_sauce
she also explained some of the more exotic items on the menu to me
the chicken_tika_masala was ok
granted
it was missing more of the complex indian spices and became one dimensional after a few bites
but the nan_bread was hot fresh
and heck
it's a food_court and much better than subway or pizza by the slice
the veggie_samosas were really quite good and came with tasty mint tamarind_sauce
great food
great
worth_the_trip
i know it's in the food_court of the riviera
but don't let that stop you from making the trip to this gem
this place is extremely good
it is the second best indian resturant in vegas
the first being namaste
it is not a hole_in_the_wall just in an off strip location
this is where the locals eat
tasty hr food
tried dosai
idli
uthappam
and veg briyani
everything was good
except idli
it's little pricey for the amount
but in the strip
it's acceptable
convenient location
if you walk to this place or take the bus or park in circus circus
rivera is one of the very old casino's
they still have their dirt from the day opened
including the slowest elevator in their parking
we found this place at the riviera and i have to say it exceeded our expectations
just walking thru the food_court and smelling the spices made me salivate
i have to say some of the best indian food i have had
i had the masala_dosa and i have to say this is one of the best dosa i have ever had
we have a few restaurants in our city that have dosa but it does not measure up to the dosa here
it was huge with lots of filling and the sambar soup served with it was spicy but not too spicy
i have not been to vegas since may and every time i think of the dosa here i start to drool
my boyfriend had the tandori combo and he said it was extremely good
i cannot wait_to_go_back again
we have had tamba before and while it is good and they offer goat my boyfriends favorite for basic indian food you cannot beat this place
i cant wait until my next trip_to_vegas just to have another masala_dosa from here and if they serve them at am on the late_night menu dont be surprized to find me there
bomb
this place is so good
the family and i wanted to get a bite to eat before watching society of seven at the riveria hotel and casino so we made our merry way to the food_court since there's a variety to choose from
walking up to the food_court
you can instantly smell the wonderful spices used in indian food
i love indian food so of course i didn't care to check out the other spots
i wanted some curry and naan
i ordered the chicken_tikka masal
chicken_vindaloo and naan
omg
so freaking good
both were served with white rice
the naan was like the size of my face
it was coated in butter and i used it to soak up sauce from my dish
the chicken_vindaloo was my favorite
it was nice and spicy and had a ton of flavor
i devoured the whole thing and ate some of the chicken_tikka masal since that was my sister's dish
she liked it too
it could have been spicier but that's just personal preference
it was kinda expensive but indian food is kind of expensive as is
each entr_e was
and the naan was
the food took a while to come out but it was worth_the_wait
i got a cup of water and the guy said if i wanted more water he'd fill it up for me
that was nice of him
i really like this place
when i go back to vegas
i will for sure come here for my indian fix
i'm craving_indian_food for dinner now
best part
it's open hours
as_good_as_it_gets
very very good indian restaurant in las_vegas blvd
indiamasala dosa samber same like chennai taste
we had wonderful food' less price
lot of food
the food might take a while to come out
just expect it
then it won't be as painful
i went here based_on the reviews here
i was suspicious first but i decided_to_give a shot since i was staying at riviera hotel anyway and was too tired to go far for food yesterday
it turned out
the place was awesome
i ordered my usual for indian food
chicken_tikka masara
to go
it came with rice and a huge naan
plenty for one person
i was so full of the container but i hated to see the rest go wasted so powered through to finish the whole thing
i didn't have a microwave to warm it up next day so saving leftover wasn't an option
it was that good
mango_lassi was also delicious too
perfect consistency and not too sweet
i give stars because i think the price is a bit steep for a food_court
if you make it to go
remember to grab silverwares and napkins
they are a food_court joint after all so they don't put those gears in a bag for you
you need to grab them yourself
i cant stand indian food
sorry its just not my cup of tea
but my wife kinda likes it and wanted to try it here
the food_court here in the riviera is literally a ghost town
i cant comprehend how all the eateries stay in business
she ordered a non_veg plate that came on a little prison plate with tiny little compartments of food and a big piece of bread
she said it all tasted pretty good and she easily finished it all
and she doesnt have a big appetitie
the cost w o drink was over
which is outrageous for food_court food during lunch
i know this is vegas and eveything is overpriced a bit
but every other eatery had equal sized portions for half the cost
plus my wife got really sick after eating it
i love me some indian masala and this place does indian exactly how i like it spicey and fresh
you will not go hungry here
and the price is perfect
we had the buffet
its so killer
i have to go back soon
mmmm mmmmmmm good
get some
the downside is that this is a relatively simple place for indian food
seriously
what can you expect from a food_court of this size
everything is authentic and aimed in the right direction
but at the same time everything falls just a hair short of what it likely would be if it were a standard restaurant
to their credit
they have a reduced menu even through the middle of the night
it's a blessing if you're stuck in the riviera at am and nobody wants to walk down the strip
it's not the kind of place to go out of your way for
but if you wind up stuck at the riviera or circus circus and need to fill up in the middle of the night
it's one of your best picks
horrible horrible horrible
we ordered over phone to pick_up
when we came to our hotel room we were shocked to see burnt naans
burnt to the core
and the parts where is not burnt it is not cooked at all
how could someone cook like this
what a waste of money
great indian food
i had the tikka masala very spicy and it delivered
obviously it's a british dish
the naan was good too
hot and soft and the bottom was crispy
the people working were very nice too
i love indian food
it is a recent obsession and i know the good stuff when i see it
the food at this food_court location is very good
the naan is fresh and tasty
all of the entrees are made fresh to order
so let the cooks know how spicy you enjoy your entrees
service
the staff is use to tourists and questions
they were very friendly and knowledgeable about the products sold
wait time
everything is cooked fresh
if you are in a rush
go to quiznos subs
the food is worth the minute wait while they cook it
price
pretty pricey for a food_court
it was for two waters
to entrees
an app of samosas and bread
this is the same price we pay at a sit_down restaurant
the drinks are not included in the combo price
location
it appears they share a kitchen with a burger joint
strange for an indian_joint
try this place if you are at the rivera casino
best indian food on the strip
and the sweetest service you'll find at any indian restaurant anywhere
went for the buffet it was ok will go back if in the area
at first we were very excited to have food here because of the great reviews
very disapppointed
food was cold
tasteless and had to wait more than min
there are better sit_down choices
please spend ypur money
at a sit_down place and get service with the meals
gave it two star
one star for the convenience and another star since they had a water dispenser on their counter
would not recommend
the good
open hours
dosa tastes well
food is ready in less than minutes
the bad
other items such as chana_masala or chilli panner tastes bad
always order something that can be prepared fast like dosa
bad food
we ordered a plain dosa and veggie combo the plain dosa was hot came with sambhar and chutneys sambhar had no salt and was watery
chutneys were watery and cold
i think made few days_ago
veggie combo had rice
naan
chole
palak_paneer
curd and dal
the palak_paneer hardly had any paneer and was firm
chole dal salt less
curd was thin and sour
i think made up few days_ago
not worth the money
just a temporary way to kill hunger
review by an indian
wish i could give this place negative stars
waited over an_hour for an order of chicken curry
the employees seemed to have no sense of urgency at all
they would stop to fill up water containers even though there were about a dozen people waiting
when we finally got the curry
it was watery and the chicken was dry
not worth_the_wait or money
ill never ever go here again
food is served fresh
very close_to_home made food
if_you_are_looking for an indian restaurant
this is the place open round the clock
first off
i have to tell you that i'm indian
so i'm probably going to be a little more critical of this place than most others
i paid for the vegetarian thali
which was pretty expensive for food that comes in a styrofoam plate from a restaurant in a food_court
the food at this restaurant is the kind of stuff that they probably cook once a day all in one batch
and then serve throughout the day
unfortunately
if you go there at am like i did
the food they serve you might be a little stale from sitting out all day
i've eaten here twice because i feel sorry for these people who don't seem to get very many customers
but i don't think i'll eat here again
the food just isn't good
and the prices are way too high
the yelp review says this place has four stars
this ranking clearly applies to the food
which is indeed tasty and fresh
well prepared
naan was puffy
doughy and crispy
what did not seem to warrant the stars was the location this place is located in the food_court of the riviera
the excellent food
served on paper_plates with plastic forks within the common area of the court brought a feeling of anticappointment not the kind of ambience the four stars erroneously suggested
come for the great food
but take it somewhere_else to enjoy
hands_down the best indian food i had in vegas
only down side is
its in a food_court and most times
i had to wait mins minimum to get my food
if you like tandoori
tandoori combo gives a small portion of different tandoori dish
caution
longer wait time for this dish
my favorite
i have tried chicken biriyani
butter_chicken combo
utthapam and tandoori combo
this is a north_indian style kitchen and expecting south_indian dishes like uthappam to be good is my mistake
biriyani was decent
butter_chicken melted in my mouth
there was a girl on the cash_register was explaining that her favorite drink is mango_lassi to one of the person ahead of me in the line
so i wanted to try it out
it turned_out_to_be the best of all mango_lassi i had
naan was soft and yummy
for tandoori combo may be little pricy
but better than most indian lunch buffet i had in vegas
i learned that they have another restaurant near the strip where they have buffet
india_masala bar grill e flamingo rd las_vegas
nv
and more like proper restaurant
i am going to try it the next time when i will be in vegas
this joint is located in riviera hotel's food mall
you can park for free at riviera self parking at the rear of the riviera casino
bottom_line
nice little joint for good tasty north_indian food
good food
like their tandoori combo and non_veg combo
people working there are friendly
would def visit again and would highly_recommend
guys i wanted to give you a star and was about to
but when my bf got home
checked his credit_card you guys took it upon yourselves to add
gratuity
humm first off
the cashier was not very friendly
everthing
we asked
for you
where out of
but over all food was tastey
next time
i am in vegas and on that side of strip i will go back
after days on the strip staying at wynn and pallazo
i needed some real flavor
this place def filled that void
will be back next time in vegas
very unhygienic place to eat
open hrs
we went with friends ordered naan
dosa
malai_kofta etc
dosa is tasteless
food tastes real bad at this place
but i see most of the indians eating here
i would prefer going to india_masala on e flamingo st
that is definitely a must try if you want indian food
a handful of years_ago
i had a successful night of luck at the riviera
whenever i win big
i want a big meal
the riviera buffet looked lacking
so i wandered to india_masala and got some kind of curry dish
it was delicious
even with the pp price tag
i happily paid it
and put india_masala as one of my favorite secrets in las_vegas
yeah well
that was a handful of years_ago
i went back yesterday and ordered the tandoori combo
yuck
firstly
it's
which is ok
it's on the strip
kinda on the strip
riviera isn't exactly a world class hotel
but it's mostly a plate of chicken
a plate of very dry chicken
the saving grace was the naan and a side of curried beans
that saved the dish from complete flavorlessness
it also comes with a side of sausage which i've never had before and they were okay
so
the food on this trip warrants stars
but the overall ambiance of the place is stars
the place is open hours
that's nice
but it shares the space with a burger place
the cashier was jumping from the burger joint to the indian counter
hey
i'm all about mom_and_pop shops
but this was not cute
it was annoying
it's at least a min wait for the food on a slow saturday_night
it being slow on saturday should've been a tip off
the service was polite
on par to what i'd find at subway
but that's ok
i don't go to indian places for good service
i didn't care for the self serve lukewarm water on the counter
in conclusion
this visit was
stars
i rounded up
but i'm hoping the first visit here wasn't some far off dream
maybe they had an off day
look no further if you want very good food on the strip
well
almost
my wife and i stayed at riviera for nights and we were pleasantly_surprised by the quality and taste of the food here
don't be fooled by the fact that it's located in a food_court
the food is really really good
we were so impressed that we ended_up eating breakfast and dinner everyday during our stay
terrible food
too much salt in the dishes
nothing is mild
everything we ate was chili pepper spicy
i know indian food is spicy
but the dishes here were unbearable
read_the_reviews before i went and thought it would be a great experience
but should have paid closer attention to what they really said
had the chicken_tikka_masala with a mango_lassi
the mango_lassi was good
the masala was over priced for the quality it was
it is in a food_court and should be evaluated as fast_food
not the greatest
but okay when you are hungry and anything will do
not the best if_you_are_looking for good indian food
though the naan was pretty good
the question i had to ask was
where's the chicken
too much sauce for the amount of meat
so
in the end
the value to quality did not justify the price
but if you get that late_night craving_for_indian_food in the city that never sleeps
this would be an okay stop as they are open hours
but for a great meal of indian food
find somewhere_else
food_court quality
i have been staring at the sign for years and finally decided to try this
honestly i was in there for parsley which isnt open yet
however
decided on trying this place out
had the tandoori sampler
was overcooked meat mostly and had the total buffet taste going on
no made to order and was not impressed
nan was highlight but wouldnt repeat
good food
ordered veg combo
shahi_paneer and mango_lassi
naan was amazing
a little expensive but worth it
r u tired by roaming on the strip
r u super hungry
go n order food from here
order the chicken combo and enjoy all tandoori variety of chicken
the taste of food is awesome
the only good thing about this restaurant is that it is open hrs
but the menu after
is very limited
we went there for dinner
since it was late in the night
and nothing else was open
food was decent
so we thought the breakfast the next day would be good too
but their aloo paratha was not at all like a reglar aloo paratha
the aloo in it was scarce
the ambience is a put off too
since it is in the food_court of a vey old casino
appears shady compared to all other casinos in vegas
i would not recommend unless you want indian food after pm
don't go for a look of this place cause this place is legit
i found this place almost two years a go and i have been here few times already and i am from houston
it's quick service and it's delicious
i love their daal
i make sure i come here every time i am in vegas
terrible service
food is bland no real indian taste
on the plus side they are open hours
good food order veg combo shaai paneer
and mango_lassi naan was amazing
good experience
this place is extremely overpriced for a small take out place in a dirty little corner of the riviera casino
the place is very shabby
and no one would ever want to sit and dine here
the portions are really really small for the price they charge
the plates in which they give the food out are made of very thin paper and all the gravy of my curry was sunk into it
trust_me no one would ever want to dine here if there was a choice
i eat indian food today after three day stay in las_vegas i can't stop to say this is best and wonder full place to eat indian food
i hop you will try too
worst place
customer_service is horrible
they started off by getting my order wrong then when i went back to have it fixed he told me he could not help me because i forgot my ticket upstairs
he then told me he would give me my money back and then said
get the fuck out of my restaurant along with a spanish curse word
if i could give them negative points i would
that kind of behavior is not acceptable ever
oh my this place is so good i really love indian food i know the good stuff servic was very good friendly chicken_tikka_masala very good not spicy thanks india_masala
they served good food
naans are made to order
food was quite good
and they are open hours
my boyfriend and i checked in to the hotel around am and we were hungry
since it's the only fast_food place in the hotel we got food from here
we got the chicken_tikka_masala
we got up to our room and the room and began eating and the chicken was cold
the sauce was warm but the the chicken wasn't warm at all
so my boyfriend called down to tell the restaurant our food was cold and the person that took our order said we took to long and hung up in his face
i called back and ask if the manager was in
he said no
so i asked for his name and he gave me a fake name
so the next day my boyfriend went down to talk to the manager and they gave him another meal free
for fast_food indian food it had a pretty good taste but some of their workers are unprofessional
had a couple of excellent meals here and plan on many more
the huge menu demands return visits
if you feel overwhelmed by the choice on offer the staff are happy to suggest dishes
it's unlicenced
but there is no corkage so pick_up some booze from one of the off licences on nicholson street
a tip though
it's a family_run place with a small kitchen staff
so go early
especially if you're a large_party
the food is well worth_the_wait though
as someone who's not usually a fan of indian_restaurants
i have to say i love_this_place
run by two generations of the extremely welcoming ali family
kismot offers all the usual dishes you'd_expect to find in on the menu in an indian restaurant
but what sets this place apart are the things you certainly wouldn't expect to see
the chocolate naan_bread
although it may sound strange
goes extremely well with the spiciness of a curry disha dn is definitely worth trying
what i wouldn't recommend to anyone but the bravest is the
spiciest_curry in scotland
according to the menu and all the staff
i wasn't plucky enough to give it a go myself
but i having spoken to people that have
i'd say it's definitely not for the faint hearted
in contrast to so many family_run local restaurants
the d_cor in kismot is upmarket
clean and elegant
this
combined with the unique atmosphere and great choice of dishes to choose from
is what i think makes it such a success
for curry and rice naan for two people you can expect_to_pay
and there is also the option of byob
definitely worth a visit
especially if_you're_looking for somewhere to cater for large groups
this place sets the standard for a family_run restuarant
it feels like your guests in their home
the food is outstanding
choclate nan was a bit sickening at first
but i found myself eating the whole thing
for a main i got the lamb_biryani with some mushroom bhajee on side
everything was perfectly_cooked
especially the bhajee
these_guys are the only people in the city that do it right
it's all very cheap too
please visit
kismot
you are one of the most impressive restaurants i have been to in edinburgh
there are two parts to this story that show why i think this
food
just superb
easily the best indian food that i have eaten thus far
i was part of a large_group of over
and we paid a fixed price each to get a large number of naans and bhajees
and a selection of different curries along with plentiful amounts of rice
all of the curries were incredibly tasty
and most of them didn't last long at all on our table
kismot also provides some interesting dishes that i have not seen replicated anywhere_else
you can get chocolate naan
no
that's not a typo
which sounds worth a go
although i haven
t tried it myself
they also serve what they call the 'kismot killer'
a stupidly hot curry that sounds more like torture than food
if you can eat it all
you get it for free
though their_website suggests
and i quote
it is recommended that you put your toilet roll in the freezer when you return home
you actually have to sign a disclaimer before you eat it
service
the restaurant is run by a family team
with the parents in the kitchen
and the eldest son commanding the front of house
it goes without saying that the parents do a great job behind the scenes in the kitchen
it is the front of house experience that puts the icing on the ca
curry for me
throughout the meal
we were attended to in the ideal way attentive
but not intrusive
orders were taken in a cheery manner
and he even joked with us as we sat and waited
his manners were truly impeccable
and he saw us out of the restaurant personally at the end of the meal
i have never before or since experienced better customer_service
as you can see
i love_this_place
you just have to go there
cancel tonight's dinner plans
and make a reservation at kismot
you will keep_coming_back for more
without a doubt one of the finest indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
the inviting and friendly atmosphere
of which the ali family are very proud
immediately creates a pleasant eating environment
the food itself is excellent
combining the traditional dishes you would expect of any self respecting curry_house with a wide array of regional specialities
particularly good is the north_indian chilli garlic
and as a man who doesn't like to have his palate destroyed by excessive spice
its strength
as with all the dishes
can be adjusted to your taste
and why not accompany your curry with the strange sounding but weirdly delicious chocolate nan_bread
although alcohol is not served
there is the option of byob with the added advantage of no corkage
kismot pride themselves on a fun atmosphere and as a result it is an ideal place to book large parties
with their group menus affordable and surprisingly varied
overall then an excellent place
whether for a great group night out or if you want to try the infamous kismot killer
vying for the place of spiciest_curry in scotland
thank you to the yelp community for turning me and my family onto kismot
we were not disappointed
what an incredible dining_experience
i am visiting edinburgh from nyc and i really wish i could take this restaurant home with me
it is a truly
family_run
establishment
we were greeted_by the sons of the husband and wife chefs who work together to make every homemade item on the menu
i wish i had written down all the dishes we had but i can tell you that no_matter_what you order you will devour every morsel
in addition to the outstanding food
my entire family agreed
best indian food we have ever had
and we have had a lot
the service was top_notch
everything came out in a timely fashion which was so impressive since it was obviously homemade
we got a chance to meet the chef after the meal to praise him and tell him about his fabulous yelp_reviews
and then promised to write another to make sure he maintains that star_rating he so deserves
to anyone visiting edinburgh
you must must visit kismot
we_will_definitely_be_back before we depart
thank you kismot for a superb experience
we just returned from dinner at kismot with mixed reviews
we ordered the family curry
literally the curry that the owner family makes and eats itself
saag panir
spinach with cheese curry
vegetable_samosas and two kinds of bread naan and garlic paratha
we were welcomed by a very genial host and were ready to love it
however
the samosas were teensy tiny little triangles in filo dough
the filo and two sauces that came with it totally overwhelmed the thimbleful of stuffing
we then waited and waited and waited for our main_courses and bread while people who arrived after us ordered and were served
our order wasn't odd or difficult so i'm not sure what the lag was
usually filling time before dinner conversing with my companion is a joy but we'd had a challenging day and the wait was just too long
finally the food arrived
the family chicken curry was delicious but i'm not sure it was what i'd actually ordered
the owner and 'warned' me that there was some unusual lemon lime fruit in the curry that was typical of bangladeshi food and you could only get it if you have a bangladeshi friend or traveled there
i was feeling adventurous so i ordered it
the dish was really yummy but nary a bangladeshi lemon in the whole thing
i asked the host about it and he said the lemon was in the sauce but
seriously
i know what lemon tastes like and it wasn't there
whatevs
the naan_bread was very good too
on_the_other_hand
the saag panir was seriously under seasoned and just didn't have much flavor
very atypical of indian food
the garlic paratha was good while hot but not palatable once it got cold
we were expecting to be wowed based_on all the yelp_reviews but this one only gets stars for the underseasoned food and the long long wait
a real family_run affair
kismot serves some of the best curry i have eaten in edinburgh
rich
flavorful and depending_on your choice hot
the staff are personable and have a real love of curry
and are happy to recommend dishes if you fancy something different
alongside the curry they do something special when it comes to nan_bread
to be precise chocolate nan
any chocolate bar you can think of has likely ended_up inside a kismot nan at some point
it can be a little theatrical when someone orders a kismot killer
google it
but this all adds the the welcoming atmosphere
overall i would recommend kismot
great curry and service
went on a team night out to kismot at christmas and it was fantastic
the service
from the detail they went into at the booking stage
we were a group of
to the welcome we received on the night was authentic and real
and i immediately started recommending it to people even before i ate my first bite
we had a sharing menu
which was fabulous value_for_money
there was so much food we couldn't finish it
extremely useful to know that it is byob and
at the time of writing
there is no corkage charge
yes
no charge
how refreshing
this is a not many frills place
plain tables and decor
it's all about the food you see
so if you are happy with that before you go your expectations will be blown_away and you will have a great night
it is efficient
clean and friendly
like all the best places_in_town
the chicken and mango curry was a hit as were the huge pakora that came out as starters
absolutely lovely family fare
have a great time when you go this is some of the best curry in edinburgh
we visited edinburgh
scotland during spring break and heard about this restaurant
the entire family was extraordinarily nice and welcoming
we ordered the korma and vindaloo
the pickel tray was amazing with all the breads
we also tried the okra and spinach side dishes and that were perfect
my year_old loved the tandoori_chicken and chocolate milkshakes
we will definitely come back
all the way from texas
others may be so inclined to usher you towards the mosque_kitchen for some traditional food
but they'd be doing you a massive disservice
kismot is absolutely one of the tastiest restaurants_in_edinburgh
i've been a handful of times
and each time it has been stellar
a recent development that left me a bit underwhelmed was their menu redesign
the menu has been drastically cut and the star_rating system has been scrapped
now
you're left with merely three levels of heat
mild
medium and hot
i take heat relatively well and medium had me sweating in my seat
in case you're wondering
they also offer the kismot killer challenge for
i think
it's a ridiculously hot dish that is chilli seeds
our friend from bangalore was pressured into accepting the challenge
and he was less than thrilled to be eating it
after three big hulking bites he quit
the staff here is stellar
they are super_nice
talkative
accommodating and knowledgeable
if they take a liking you may even meet auntie in the back
the only reason this place is receiving stars and not is the loudness
the place is very open and conversations echo quite a bit
therefore
if a stag or hen party is there then you may as well assume you won't be hearing much else than their banter
the place is byob
very friendly service with some secret recipe treats included to make the meal more interesting and fun
good selection of curries
but get there early or book ahead
plenty of vegetarian_options too
this may be the best indian i have ever had
i've had several curries on this long trip
but wow this one wins the prize
they are also byob
which is fairly common in the states at asian and indian_restaurants
but perhaps not as much here
so it was a very nice treat to bring loads of wine and beer for the group
dimly lit
casual atmosphere
and friendly service
there were about ten of us in a group
but everything went really smoothly
started with some delicious chicken pakoras with a few different sauces
then followed it up with the chicken deshi khani and a side of the best
freshest sag alu i've ever had
the deshi khani is advertised as being
limited availability
and a special
particularly authentic curry
spicy
rich
and succulent
it was one of the best curries i've ever had
and the sag alu
not the fatty
but delicious
creamy spinach you usually get at indian_restaurants
this was fresh and brimming with spice
would've been happy to get it as a main with paneer
but i didn't think to do so because i figured it would be pretty standard instead of spectacular
and i was wrong
my friend ordered something they used to serve but is no longer printed on the menu and they still make it for her
fragrant pilau_rice and hot
crispy garlic_naan made this such an outstanding meal
i'd beeline here the next time i was in edinburgh because as far as i'm concerned
this is as good as indian gets
we did some intensive research on where to eat for our recent trip to edinburgh and are so glad we stumbled on this true gem of a restaurant to experience
i'd checked out the menu and website so was really looking_forward to the 'family run' and 'authentic' kismot
even from the initial call to reserve our table there was warm and friendly service and a cheeky chappie attitude
we arrived in a taxi as the actual restaurant was situated outside of the city centre where we stayed and even the taxi driver had heard great things about the place
we were greeted like family and it was clear from how busy the place was that it's a favourite of a lot of people
we'd considered taking beer as it's byob establishment but decided to try sample the novelty of just the curry instead
the staff were very buzzy
and we were seated in the corner by the window where we had ample opportunity for people watching and the to see into the kitchen which is a great experience in itself
the mam and dad do the cooking and the boys cousins uncles do the waiting on
we had poppadoms to chow over while we considered the menu and with them the best pickle try ever all were tasty
tangy and plentiful
we ordered a starter to share and i just had to try kismot naga pickle just to be able to say i'd tried it
the mr had a sweat on just thinking about it
well it pained my insides so please take care should you feel brave enough to try it
the small pot of it which was brought was sufficient to taste but not over indulge
the starter of mixed tikka was huge
all the meat was of a good quality and the salad was a nice accompaniment
the staff were very attentive and when we had a time to wait or a break between courses one of them always came over to check we were doing ok and just have general chit chat
we honestly felt_like very special friends
for main_course we had
lamb ada cooked with fresh ginger
tomatoes
lemon methi leaves and strong eastern spices
chicken zeera roast cumin seeds
fresh herbs coriander
garlic_nan
again
the portions were huge
not really a complaint but the 'not so skinny brother' might have taken a bit of offence that we were well and truly stuffed and seemed like we hadn't even made a dent in the food and had this not been the st of out night stay we would have certainly taken the rest home
the meat was great quality and the flavours just as described
definitely notes of food made with experience and love
the bill was almost embarrassingly minimal for what we had enjoyed but it just shows you don't have to pay over the odds to get truly good food and great service
we had a great time at this place and have recommended it to everyone who will listen for when they visit edinburgh
we hope to get back to it one day
kismot shuts for a family holiday in february
it closes for almost a whole month and this is one of the reasons for my increase in curry reviews
that month made me realise that while some other purveyors of curry are really good
i rate kismot above them
they also recently reworked the menu
dropping a few of the less popular specialities and streamlining it
it now separates the curries by spiciness
so depending_on what you fancy you can focus on one part
as the old adage goes
absence makes the heart grow fonder
kismot has earned five_stars from me
i keep_coming_back and it really is the best curry in edinburgh
i am not sure why i haven't done a review of kismot earlier as this is one of my favourite restaurants_in_edinburgh
i have been coming here for a number of years and i think this is due to the proximatey of the auld hoose alternative music
a couple of brews and then onto a curry
cannot beat that of an evening for me
onto the restaurant the decor has had a little bit of a face lift of late with some newly designed posters
as has the menu
not going to go into too much detail as previous reviewers have mentioned this
but it is a good thing
one thing that stuck me is the new additions to the menu kismot naga pickle and iron bruna
yep a curry with irn bru
this is a family_run restaurant and the sons greet you on the door with a bit of friendly banter
you can see the other family members beavering away in the kitchen when you first enter
the food here is always up to high standards and our last outing was no exception
we opted for the pickle trays
poppadoms
raitha and naga chilli pickle
all washed down with lots of mango_lassi
the starter was great but the naga chilli in particular was excellent
beware this comes with an certificate warning and is very spicy
the main_courses were veg madras
chicken masalla
prawn passanda and chicken_tikka north_indian chilli garlic
all were great their chilli garlic is still my favourite version of this disk in edinburgh
one thing to bear in mind you get lots of rice and the nans are large so unless you ha vent eaten all day a rice and nan portion does easily
either that or it was something to do with the fact we order another jug of lassi
but i don't think i ever come away as full eating any where else
thumbs_up from me
favourite dishes here
mums desi khani
homemade curry with limited availability
worth a try if you are there at the weekend
mango_lassi by the jug
bhindi
north_indian chilli garlic
any of the madras dishes
naga chili pickle
beware very spicy
methi
raitha
easily the best traditional style curry_house in edinburgh
long since recommended but we'd never gotten around to a visit
we loved it
the service was great and the knowledge of the food was second to none
able to tailor our flavours to the level of heat we wanted
and since i'm a softie and my wife loves the intense heat this was great
it reminded_me_of the best indian food i'd eaten as a student
but better
i cannot wait_to_go_back
i was looking for a nice restaurant in edinburgh while i was in town for a short visit
and decided_to_give kismot a try
the food was excellent
and more than sufficiently spicy
portions were generous
and the staff_was_very_friendly
i am very glad i decided to try this place out
one bit of advice
i was lucky to get in without a reservation
as the place was quite busy
if you plan to go
phone ahead
just dined here last evening on a trip to edinburgh
read their reviews on trip advisor and had to stop by for a bite
it definitely met all my expectations
personalized service
home_cooked authentic food
i always return home from a trip craving a meal from my own kitchen
tired of mass produced
restaurant food
the owners parents are the cooks
and the home cooking really shines through
i ordered the lamb rogannjosh with garlic_naan
lamb was fork tender
curry well seasoned and containing bits of fresh veggies chopped up
including sliced tomato
this curry was made with loving hands
not poured from a jar
bravo
i have no doubt you'll enjoy your meal if you stop by
my only regret was that i couldn't taste all the unique curries offered
but i guess that's just a reason to go back
tummy growls
this was the best and spiciest_curry i found in edinburgh
it was also had the single best restaurant decor i have ever seen
the place is literally family_run and they're some of the most hospitable and friendly people in the world
i went on a curry tour of edinburgh while i was on holiday
i've eaten curry on three continents now and
back home
i like to get my indian take away and add both habaneros and ghost pepper hot_sauce to it before i eat it
curry
and especially spicy curry
is very much an essential part of my life
so i picked a new indian_joint each night while i was in the city in an attempt to find it
the kismot killer wasn't available at the time i showed_up but i was advised by my waiter
one of the coolest
most welcoming guys i've ever met
it's so spicy that it takes away from the actual flavor of the curry
anyway
let's be honest
there's a point when spicy becomes less about flavor and enjoyment than pure ego
so i got the next spiciest_curry on the menu vegetable naga and asked for it extra_spicy
with rice and chapati
the food was excellent
the dish
even without modification
was actually a fair amount spicy which
if i can taste a bit of spice
most people probably shouldn't eat it and the flavors were so vivid and pleasant
i would've preferred it spicier by a bit but that's okay
it was still the spiciest_curry i was able to find in the city and definitely my favourite
next time i go to edinburgh i shall be visiting again
we visited due to the excellent reviews on trip advisor
we were not disappointed
even our taxi driver had had it recommended countless times via word of mouth
service was excellent
lamb was slow cooked_to_perfection naan_bread was super
theonly let down was that we had ordered from the meduium section and the curries were not at all hot
they were very good though
thank you for a delicious meal
we will definitely recommend to our friends be back next time were in edinburgh
great to see a family restaurant doing so well
friendly
efficient service was the icing in the cake of the best lamb saag i've_ever_eaten
byob policy
no corkage charge what's not to like
the food was just ok and kind of bland
we have enjoyed indian food around the globe and neither the food nor the service impressed
it was ramadan so maybe that had an effect
but after all the great reviews
we were disappointed
kismot is a family_run restaurant that has excellent food and service
they do not serve alcohol but have no problem with you bringing your own
they even remind you of this when making the booking
upon arrival
we were warmly greeted_by the son and seated promptly
the decor is modern and the ambiance has a lively feel
we tried a few different curries
tarka dhal
and the garlic_naan
everything was delicious and we were stuffed beyond belief
i cannot emphasize how great the service was here
they make you feel as if you were invited to eat at their home with mum and dad cooking
wonderful place and a must try
good but not as great as others are saying
the bad
the naan simply wasn't very good
i am used to fresh
fluffy naan with intense garlic flavour
these were huge but rather flavourless and a bit chewy
the pilau_rice was also fairly flavourless and disappointing
for the mains
our tandoori_chicken was okay but the meat was overcooked and dry
the good
our curry was quite pleasant and the mango_lassi was also good
also no complaints on the service
verdict
perhaps we had over inflated expectations
but this was simply a decent indian restaurant with nothing exceptional
i take the sides
rice and naan
seriously and they were a let down
funky is the first word to come to mind
the place is all pinks and purples and turquoises and dark tables
even the water jugs are purple or turquoise
there's a plasma screen showing a loop commercial for their king of curry thing that they do
with their top media hits included
it's kind if distracting watching jack whitehall and james corden crying and drinking bowls of yoghurt
but it kind of fits with the funky thing
if they took out the tables
chucked in a couple of lava lamps and cushions
and maybe tiled one wall with tiny mosaic mirrors
it'd be a cocktail bar nightclub
but it's a restaurant
and it is good at being a restaurant
the food hit_the_spot perfectly
our vegetable_pakora onion bhajis were soft and crispy
while my chicken_korma was rich
creamy
plentiful and contained great big hunks of birdy goodness
the peshwari_naan don't quite reach the giddy heights of those served at skipton balti in yorkshire
nothing ever will
but they're easily the closest i've had
sweet and flavoury
still totally a word
they're lined with deliciousness
the staff dealt with our considerable party size expertly
even shuffling tables in and out to match our miscounted numbers with not a rolled eye to be seen or a tut to be heard
i was surprised there was no water brought until we asked
well after the arrival of the poppadums at the start
but it was otherwise pretty flawless service too
it's a bit outr for my tastes in terms of decor but it's damn fine food
y'all
as far as listing what's good about this place goes
i don't know where to start
recently opened on busy and bustling nicolson street
in delhi is perfect for everything from meeting friends for coffee
to a full lunch
to simply wanting_to_try the mango cheesecake they advertise on the blackboard outside
i can say that much from personal experience
what i love most about this place is that it stands_out from all the other lunch coffee places in this area of edinburgh
the walls and menus are covered with bollywood film covers
and the seats and ceiling are covered with bright coloured
sequinned drapes and throws
whilst the bright colours might not sound very relaxing
the seats are bean bag comfy and the low tables give the whole place an authentic yet informal atmosphere
the kitchen is all open plan so you can see exactly how your food is being prepared
i usually go for the spicy chicken roti wrap when i'm there
which just like the veggie and other meat rotis comes with home made salads
pickles and chutneys which are always different every time you go
for those less predictable than me
the counter is fit to burst with homemade pakoras
samosas and bhajis of various descriptions and fillings
which again are all served with the lovely sides
the infamous mango cheesecake
whilst not as sweet as usual cheesecakes
was so more ish i even thought about ordering a second piece
no alcohol is served
but you couldn't ask for a bigger selection of soft_drinks
ranging_from the usual fizzy drinks you'd_expect to the more exotic my personal favourites are the bundaberg ginger beer or the rubicon mango juice
don't miss
if you're a student
take your snapfax and get discount on roti wraps and coffees
this cafe looks nothing on the outside like it looks on the inside
which is probably why it took me so long to get to it
in delhi's on nicolson street
which is a pretty busy street
as far as edinburgh's concerned
though it's no princes street
so the bustle of people always seemed to keep it well hidden
the outside is white with scrawling letters
and it has two large windows that show a whole bunch of colourful drapes on the walls
and similarly colourful pillows on the seats
i can't really decide whether it's tacky and overwhelming
or quite comforting
the pillows are definitely comfortable
in any case
they serve a variety of indian_cuisine
as well as lassis
juice
passion fruit
lychee and more
delicious chai and coffees
i had a desi coffee when i was there
which was full of cinnamon
always a good sign
the food's normally less than a fiver
and you get a pretty good
filling amount
around the cafe
and inside the bathroom there are loads of magazine photos of indian stars and they show music_videos on a small tv
i definitely recommend going in for a desi coffee
if you're a fan of cinnamon
and a vanilla flavoured chai if you're around the area and want to get away from the sirens and bustle of buses and cars on nicolson street
when i first arrived in edinburgh
this place had only been open a fresh six months
and you could certainly tell by their low penetration pricing
for one of their delicious chicken rotis meals
one could get away with paying
however
they've certainly gained popularity and increased the prices along the way
don't take it the wrong way
their still quite cheap
and thankfully now making a profit on their meals
but i should still be allowed to grumble for the old days
the rotis are cheaper
still coming with a snap fax discount
as well as a salad and a little side of delicious stewed chickpeas
it's also possible to buy a variety of snacks at the counter
my favourite being the pakora
for a more wholesome meal
they've got a nice variety of curries
and i very much recommend you try their desi chai_tea
which is spiced
sweet indian tea which has a tendency to make me quite sleep each time i drink it
having eaten at least fifteen roti's there
no joke
i especially love the charming and colourful indian d_cor
the constant bollywood movies playing on the flatscreen tv
and the indian celebrity magazines they've got on hand for waiting customers
to in delhi is a great little indian coffee shop in the newington area of edinburgh
it is really cosy inside
with a small seating_area covered in brightly covered drapes and indian music_playing in the background very authentically indian
although it is quite small inside it could very easily feel cramped
but they have decorated it in such a way that it feels cosy and intimate
there is a small counter at the back of the shop selling traditional_indian food as well as hot and chilled drinks
to in delhi use authentic indian terms on their menu when listing the food
they have a range of dishes available such as pakora's and samosas and there is an impressive selection of vegetarian meals available too
the staff are warm adn inviting and willing to explain what a particular dish is
to in delhi is a great place to sit in or takeaway food to get a little taste_of_india
to in delhi has a pretty cool name
and that was part of the reason why my mate and i first went inside
the interior decor feels stylish and cosy with plenty of pictures and ornaments to make you feel like you've stepped into india
the menu_is_extensive
with plenty of authentic indian dishes
only some of which i had actually heard of before
i went for the tandoori lamb kebabs which were delicious
spicy and served with really fresh salad
it came in a nice
big portion and cost only about
the service is friendly and efficient
making to in delhi well worth a look if you're in the area
stepping in here and you feel like you've stepped into another world
they have gone all out with the indian decor jewel coloured drapes cover the walls and cosy cushions fill the seats
it smells incredible in here as well which immediately got my tastebuds excited
and they weren't disappointed
the long menu means that you are bound to find something you fancy
i didnt know what a lot of the stuff on the menu was
but that just adds to the fun and if you ask the staff for suggestions they don't look at you and laugh but explain patiently what the dishes are
i was very pleasantly suprised by the prices which has made this a regular haunt for me for a full meal or just a coffee or cold drink
deceptively plain looking on the outside
step into in delhi and you'll be transported to india
the interior is decked out in multi coloured cushions and drapes and scarves
which make you feel like an extra in a bollywood film
this is added to by the fact they actually have bollywood films playing in the background
sometimes a slight distraction but good fun nonetheless
also if you want to brush up on your hindi they have indian books that you can have a nose in
the food itself is excellent and refreshingly different from most other places in edinburgh
it is a great mix of indian and snacky food
like a more low key mother_india caf
they do excellent curries which can be put into a wrap
the roti wraps
definitely the highlight of the caf
but there are also loads of other indian style nibbles to try
these wraps
despite being reasonably_priced to start with
are off with a snapfax
they also have an excellent range of hot and cold drinks
including the chai
which is amazing
this comes with a free little biscuity cakey type thingy which
although i am generally not a fan of cakes
was pretty good
the staff here are lovely and it is generally pretty cheap so definitely drop in for a great alternative to the standard sandwich bars that litter edinburgh
authentic chai
in edinburgh
at last
this little place is gorgeous
and smacks of india with its bollywood movies in the background and chai simmering away on the stove
service is good
there is probably a little room for improvement in display and presentation of the deli section
but nothing that will put you off
it's the kind of place i want to return to with a book and order a never ending pot of chai
lovely
nice
the flatmate and i ducked in for a bite this past friday_night
after recommendations from yelp
it's listed as a tea house within the restaurant section and until i got in it didn't realise that it really was just a tea house that did food and not a restaurant that does tea
saying
just a tea house
is really selling it short
though
for we got mixed plate of tons of starters
salad
curries and drinks
it said it included a slice of cake or indian sweets which we weren't offered but to be honest
we would have struggled to fit dessert in anyway
as for the place itself
it's cosy and really decked out like an indian tea tent
the bollywood movies are highly entertaining but the bhangra music can get a bit much
not enough to stop me going back
though
what can i say about delhi that hasn't already been said
it's really lovely
gorgeous
cozy decor bright hangings
comfy pillows thrown about
would really warm up a windy edinburgh afternoon
delicious food tried the lamb samosas and chicken_tikka_masala and they were both great
generous portions as well and the prices so sinfully low
i felt a bit criminal
like i was robbing the place
the service is very friendly and courteous and there's a great selection of teas
it'd be a lovely place to while away a rainy afternoon
sipping on tea and nibbling on poppadoms if you can get a table
it gets quite busy
and rightfully so
indian nom nom nom
so as a friend and i completed our awesome fancy dress outfits we decided that we needed some food to reward our efforts
we had been admiring the mosque_kitchen and thinking of giving it a go
my amigo pointed_out a very true thing
it doesnt look very authentic
it looks like any cafe restaurant that could be serving anything so on we went
we saw dehli and inspected the menu
cheap we thought and with him being a student on we went inside
as you go inside your eyes and other senses are assaulted
the vibrant decor
the smell of the food
the music and the bollywood madness on the screen transport you to another world away from the bustling world outside
one thing we did notice immedietrly was the high number of indian customers
there is a lot to be said we agreed for a restaurant if its a palce where the people of said country cuisine go to dine there
you kind of think
yeah
this is going to be good
after reviewing the menu we opted for the
sharing platter
after a reasonable wait we were not disappointed
what appeared before us was a rorating platter with different dishes
lovely fragrant rice
chipati and naans
chickpea_curry
spinach and potato dish
alak gook perhaps im not good with names
chicken masala
badjis with cous cous and salad with yogurt_sauce
also included for this price were a juice
i had gauva juice
so damn goood
also included was a desert to share which was a mango cheesecake
the base wasa very buttery shortcake
with a cream rich cake with pieces of mango through it topped and decorated with passionfruit
raspberry and mango purees
amaaaaazing
jd hugely happy man will be back here for sure
if to in delhi were a white walled
standard caf it wouldn't be getting as high a rating
but it's not
it is a gorgeous
small yet overwhelming little cave of a caf covered in floor to ceiling with throws
occasinoal wafts of incense floating across the smell of curry and cutting through the bollywood tunes
whilst my date was excited at the thought of actually sitting on the floor to eat
apparently partial to it
we weren't quite there
but the seats are low and cushy and comfy so it definitely lends itself to relaxed caf culture than restaurant
but then you order a huge plate of curry for lunch and wonder how you could justify this on a weekly basis
i mean
you can't say you couldn't afford it considering it only costs for a plate of steaming
fresh curry
for their student deals
seriously
and if you don't want curry there are cakes and amazing sounding coffees
mango cheesecake with an amaretto coffee
yes please
it is just
magical
which kind of overshadowed the fact my curry was only so so
i ordered the daily special of lamb_curry
presentation definitely lacking
see photo
but hey curry isn't exactly going for those brownie points anyway
a bit sloppy
a lot of sauce
the 'steamed' turret of rice that goes a bit chewy quite quickly
very very small side salad
the lamb was nice and tender
but there wasn't much of it
and the curry was strangely not spicy
at all
my date agreed her veggie curry was also not spicy
not even mild
just no spice
it's hard to say what the taste was as usually there is some form of obvious spice
even mustard
cutting through mild curries
so for the food itself
i would not rush back
the cheesecake maybe
but if you are short of pennies and want a very filling meal
in quite magical surroundings you won't find anywhere_else in edinburgh
then to in delhi in the place
i think it might be a case of they do some things really well
their chai lattes and cheesecakes
and it's good value and it's really kitschy and put together
but for a foodie like me
i know i could get something far more flavoursome for only a few pound more
still
it was perfect for a lunchtime date
in dehli
by no means
the freshest
or tastiest curry you will have in edinburgh
but it's cheap and fast and friendly
the pakoras were a little chewy
the curries were a little greasy
the breads were cut up too thin
why oh why did someone take time to make something less useful
but god damn i got a big tasty plate of food for i can't think of many other places that would do the same
and a can of diet coke was a pound
i'm_so_glad that's how they roll
i hate it when places charge you
for wee glass of draught pepsi
or a wee bottle of coke
to sum up
not the finest
but you'll struggle to find better value
my go to place when i am hungry
on a budget
but craving something tasty and worth more than what i paid
i always get their chicken masala which seems to be a very popular dish here
which says a lot about how it tastes
they also have tasty options for vegetarians
my vegetarian roommate loves it here
for dessert
i always get their mango cheesecake
which
i'm salivating now just thinking about it
it's wonderful
if you go here
you must get the mango cheesecake
the decor is beautiful as well
with colorful drapes covering every square inch of the walls
i wish they had a larger selection of dishes
but the selection they do have is tasty
if you're craving indian_cuisine
want somewhere cozy to relax while eating
and you have only pounds in your pocket
this is the place
a quirky and effeminate little indian cafe to in delhi is almost ideal for the lunchtime curry craving
almost
offering a basic selection of curries at good value
it feels a bit mean to point out the curries themselves are very mild
obviously this is to cater to the widest audience possible but it left me craving another
spicier
curry
the decor is much as early holywood pictured a sultan's harem
the smells are at least in part from incense
at a guess nag champa
all in all for me to in delhi is trying too hard
the service was friendly and efficient
but based_on the food and the fact i wasn't as enamoured by the decor as some
i find this place simply ok
this is probably the main competitor of the mosque_kitchen
serving cheap curry to hungry people
i would much rather eat here though
to succeeds in creating that tranquil hippy atmosphere
the interior is quite a world away from the freezer outside
bollywood music
incense and colourful cushions and fabrics give the illusion that you're in some chai tent at glastonbury festival
that's a good thing
by the way
whilst the mosque_kitchen delivers vast quantities of food in a canteen like set up
here you get table service
a menu
and somewhere comfortable to sit
sure
the menu is limited
but it's not really that bad
you are not going to find a cheaper meal anywhere lentil dahl and rice or naan for
it comes with a little salad and some couscous
which is a nice_touch
considering how inexpensive it is
i also ask for extra spice with the lentil dahl
as without it
it can be a little on the mild side
probably safer if they are making bulk quantities of one dish
as some people hate spice
i have also had the chickpeas a few times
and my boyfriend has tried the paneer
you can tell everything has been microwaved through
yet it was originally homemade
and this is the likely reality of most indian_restaurants
you would be waiting a lot longer if you really wanted them to make it from scratch especially for you
and you'd be paying more
the chai and mango cheesecake here also look interesting
though i haven't actually tried them so can't comment
the service here is very friendly
but not in your face
which is quite refreshing
i go to the delhi cafe about once a week i can't resist
i love everything about it
apart from the toilet facilities
the food is cheap and delicious
the curry is very flavourful
the naan_bread just_the_right_amount_of garlicky
the rice is lovely and a refreshing little side of fresh salad and couscous comes on your plate
portions are the perfect size
enough to not make you feel like you'd want more
but not so much that it's a struggle
yummy
comforting food that doesn't leave you feeling over stuffed
the staff are lovely as well
very efficient and up for a wee chat
what more could you want
love it
i'd give it stars if they gave the toilet a bit of a re furb
this is probably my favorite restaurant in edinburgh
the atmosphere
consistent quality
low prices
and delicious options make this my go to place when friends come to visit or when i'm just not in the mood to cook
you really can't beat for excellent curry in a cozy restaurant
and it's great for students
as it's a minute walk from the main campus

really tasty and cheap
lot of choice and delicious mango cheesecake
vraiment bon et pas cher
beaucoup de choix et un cheesecake la mangue d licieux
i can not rave about this golden gem enough after eating here days out of a day visit to edinburgh
food
everything you expect plus more
perfect amount of flavor
spice
and portions
started with the vegetable_samosa which ended_up being extremely filling as it comes with a side of chickpeas
small salad
and scoop of cous cous
more than i expected that on my second visit i ordered the same
added a side of rice and called it a meal
during my first visit i also had the lentils and rice
i'm used to ordering yellow lentils but found their red lentils more pur ed than solid
but still flavorful
second and third visit consisted of enjoyed their cheesecakes
just get it
trust_me
service
treated me like we've know each other for years
i definitely didn't feel like a visitor and of course contributed to the many reasons why i returned
i was informed after my meal they only accepted cash
after feeling embarrassed
their trust allowed for me to disappear for a while while searching for cash
they greeted me back with a smile
that's where strangers became best friends
affordability
a
tips
chat it up with the staff
cash only
go back again
and again
and again
incredibly cheap and good with a nice_atmosphere
i even took my in laws here when they were visiting
i had a very enjoyable lunch at mother_india last weekend
the idea of tapas_style indian food is very appealing as you get to try a whole variety_of_dishes rather than just a couple of main_courses
we split our choices between vegetable sand meat
a crispy chilli chicken dosa
standard chicken curry
mushroom bhaji and okra and potatoes
unlike some asain restaurants they didn't seem afraid to put a bit of a spice kick into their food which was appreciated
as another reviewer points out
you'll need at least one portion of rice per_person as they are quite small but the great thijng about the tapas_style is you can keep ordering until you've had your fill
service was very friendly and food delivered promptly
i'd have no hesitation about a return_visit
mother_india had long been considered one of the best places to get a curry in glasgow
so the decision to open a branch in edinburgh was a good one
when the cafe opened in edinburgh in the locals breathed a collective sigh of relief
finally an establishment had opened that put a new perspective on indian food
the menu advises that you order to dishes per_person and share everything tapas_style
my favourite thing about going out for a curry is sampling what everyone_else has ordered
and that's exactly what mother_india has capitalised upon
everything is cooked to order and brought to your table as soon as it's ready
when dining with a large_group of people
you easily forget how much you've ordered and the dishes just seem to keep on coming
which is no bad thing given how delicious it all is
highlights on the menu include the spiced haddock
which is cooked_to_perfection in tinfoil
and the butter_chicken
a heavenly concoction that tastes so good it must be very very bad for you
the food here is tasty
the prices are cheap and the atmosphere is convivial just make sure you come with a few friends
so you can sample as many dishes as possible
a friend told me i should go and try this place
presumably because he was so sick of me banging on about in delhi just up the road from here
maybe i didn't go in with an open mind
but i have to say there was nothing particularly special about this place
yes
they do an amazing selection of spiced
herbal or green teas
and yes the nibbles sized dishes on the food menu were tasty
the mushroom poori and chilli chicken dosa in particular
i thought the whole place lacked a bit of character that so many other indian eateries have
the furniture d_cor was very formal and serious
which is pretty much the opposite of what a restaurant with a tapas mentality should be in my opinion i loved how we were constantly dipping into eachother's dishes sampling sharing them all
but sitting at those tables i felt as though i was doing something i shouldn't be every time i did
an indian style tapas restaurant which although quite new is very popular with the locals
i really like this place just because i can order a selection of indian foods and try a bit of a variety
however
if it's crowded
which is usually is
it gets very noisy
as the sound seems to bounce of the walls and celling
our waiter was good
although if you have a small tolerance for very hot stuff do not go with their suggestions of medium our was charmingly tearing up during my date
so pretty with makeup down my cheeks yes
on friday's and saturday evenings book in advance
it's reasonably_priced as far as edinburgh restaurants as well
i was really excited about visiting mother_india in edinburgh
considering the repute of mother_india in glasgow and the established knowledge that the group's food has blown_away a lot of people
not least the competition
the restaurant has a cute little premises on infirmary street
small
but perfectly formed and set around two levels
and with a good bit of room on the downstairs floor too
i appreciate the idea of indian tapas is quite a novel one
or it certainly seems to be something you don't encounter often
being a big_fan of tapas and spanish food
i do understand the attraction of having little snack size portions of quite a few dishes
and not limiting yourself to the one variety
which normally i would firmly approve of
considering my indecisive nature and food jealousy tendencies when other people are presented with their meal
as tasty as all the food here was
i found the tapas aspect a bit too much for me
with my palate unable to cope with the amount of different spices and indian taste sensations it was being bombarded with
perhaps i'm just inexperienced in this field
and need to give tapas indian style more of a chance
but for now i'm sticking with my main indian dish
rice
and naan
feel free to call this boring
but it seems i'm old fashioned and stuck in my ways when it comes to certain types of food
mother_india is something different
although at the time i didnt realsise there was a mother_india in glasgow
when i was here recently
i knew i had found something a bit special
set aside in a tiny fronted building
inside mother_india spans two floors and is a lovely mixture or traditional and more modern concepts when it comes to the decor
it's actually rather pleasing on the eye
and if i were able to bring a few scatter cushions and a bean bag
i would have a perfect chill out space
anyway
the food here is something different its kind of like the bastard love child of spain and india a selection of tiny portions designed to be eaten tapas_style
but from a very indian menu
the concept actually work very well the food is not only excellent
but by ordering lots of dishes everybody gets a taste of what they fancy without suffering from food envy
there is
depending_on what combination of food you order
a overpowering sense of flavour which may be unpleasent to some peoples tastes
however
anything that manages to put a modern spin on indian food is good with me
it also helps that i love tapas
so
yay
i'm a fan
i first noticed mother india's cafe when sitting in cafe nero across the road
looking out
it looked interesting so i had to try it
this indian restaurant certainly is a bit different
as the others have suggested
it isn't just another takeaway or indian buffet house
but a tapas_style restaurant where you can sample many dishes
in this respect mother india's cafe earns points for being different
i did enjoy the food here at mother india's cafe but i more enjoyed the tea
the latter was quite exciting
the former
for all its ingenuity
wasn't as great as i had hoped
i also have to agree with fiona about the setting
inside it is rather too bland and formal and i didn't feel overly relaxed
at the same time the waiter was very friendly and the pricing was average
not a bad indian restaurant with a novel idea
but it could do with improving its atmosphere
my first trip to this restaurant was a snap decision
one i'm extremely happy about
the moment i realized it serves indian food
tapas_style
i had a little bit of an epiphany
sure they'd obviously already come up with the idea
but i still felt it was incredibly genius and worth having an epiphany over any how
and yes
the food did rock my world
for the small amounts that each meal comes in
this is my_only_complaint
more please
there's a lot of quality packed in
i had a wonderful chicken curry with nuts
giggle
spicy prawns
some pakoras which were surprisingly spicy and my one and only love
peshwari_naan
i didn't feel incredibly full after the meal
which was less than after splitting the bill
it's probably not great to be rolling out of the restaurant
but the glutton in me feels it's only right if you're paying for the food
it's incredibly busy
and there was a minute wait_for_a_table
i triply recommend it
i was a bit leery of paying
tapas plate prices
for indian food
but this was delicious and worth the small premium
we did pay a wee bit more than we would've for a more traditional_indian menu
the aubergine
eggplant
fritters were amazing
the samosas were some of the best we've had
and the chicken_tikka mahkni sauce was creamy
rich and the perfect blend of spicy sweet
mother india's was my first experience of non british indian food
you know what i mean
indian is indian
but us brits have a way of doing it that makes it distinctly british indian
creamy kormas
and don't forget the vindaloo
don't_get_me_wrong
this sort of indian is nice
but it's all a little repetitive
mother india's cafe serve up far more authentic_indian_food
in tapas_style portions
which means you can order or different dishes to share in all the flavours and textures
and this can only be a good thing
the curries are absolutely_delicious
and a million miles away from the standard
chicken_tikka_masala
my personal favourites are the aubergine and potato curry
channa dahl
ginger and chilli chicken
lamb pasanda
in fact it's all pretty damned good
they also do a takeaway service
although no delivery
and it's something i make use of frequently
rather handily with the takeaway you can order a 'large' portion which is bigger than the tapas portions you get with sitin
i've only done takeaway from here so far
and everytime the food has been hot
hot
hot
both tasty hot
spicy hot
and sexy hot
yep you heard me
my only recommendation
try it
when i heard it was a tapas_style indian restaurant it almost put me off but i am soo glad i went
great food
quick service and sensible price do not miss
i was here this afternoon for lunch
service is very prompt
which i appreciate
the wall coverings are lovely
and lend the place a very upscale image
foodwise
myself and a friend ordered dishes
rice
and garlic_naan bread
bill total
not bad
considering we walked away pleasantly full
the spicy chili king prawns were delicious
unfortunately there were only prawns
and potato
definitely worth it though
the mushrooms on a flake puff pastry was good as well
more so for the pastry than the mushrooms
tikka chicken was well cooked
and came with an abundance of onions and peppers
the thing with lamb and spinach was delicious as well
and was our only dish that came with some sort of
gravy
with which we could eat our naan_bread
overall
a very good experience
i really liked the wallpapers that they used
it felt very chic
but the price tag wasn't super ridiculous
recently went to mother_india with my gang of friends
a friend_of_mine thrown a party for his new job
there is always a reason to celebrate
we were people and i have something in mind to order as all other guys were no idea about what to eat
it is a tapas_style and not bad
spicy hot
good ambience
calm
relaxed
no problem to get the table
the staffs are friendly
we ordered nans
kebabs
butter_chicken
patina lamb
chicken_tikka makhani
butter_chicken particular was so tasty
wow
yes
we were so hungry
offcourse some pints
it was about pounds and not bad
i find some this cafe particularly authentic in thier indian stuffs
btw its a tapas_style so you can order other dishes too
all together it was a nice time
and yes
will visit again
checked this out last_night as i had a frined to meet in edinburgh
as_good_as_it_gets to be honest with regard to quality of food and authenticity of flavors
traditional
yet
complex
a tapas lover's
indian delight
i came to mother_india a_few_weeks_ago with a bunch of friends who frequent this place often
we had a table booked for pm on a saturday_night
we walked in and it was like a party
in the best way possible
it smelled amazing in the restaurant so i was very excited
there were six of us so we ordered a variety_of_dishes
it's tapas_style so we shared everything
the food arrived almost immediately which was great for us
a stand out dish for me was the prawns grilled in a chilli sauce
our server was very kind and helpful
i think that this would be a great date spot
some colleagues from work often order the takeaway on a friday_night they do larger portions for this
however
one thing to note is that i didn't find the food to be particularly spicy
this can be a good thing if you have a less spicy palette
i'm definitely a fan and will be back
indian tapas is most certainly a new concept
and works quite well for small appetites
or those who want to try a bit of everything
each mini dish costs between
and whilst a small plate would probably suffice for me for lunch
others may need two three a head
i come here quite often with my parents
and usually get some poppadoms with chutney
a vegetarian dosa which comes with a fresh little salad
and something to share with my boyfriend
which is usually saag panner
indian cheese which doesn't melt
is white
and cubes of it are cooked into sauces
or a mushroom dish which i don't remember_the_name of
we usually have a rice dish on the table too
the only naan i tried here was peshwari
and it was very sweet
stuffed with raisins and grated coconut
it was delicious
though to me more of a pudding snack
there are quite a few veggie_options
which is good for me
my dad and my boyfriend
but my mum who eats fish was equally satisfied with her choices
there also a few specials everyday
i think they could do with more indian pudding options though
whilst they sell very good pistachio ice_cream
it's just not kulfi
mother_india is conveniently located near the national museum of scotland and the university of edinburgh
across the road from blackwells book shop
i'd passed by this place so many times but hadn't taken too much notice
but when a friend suggested going i was happy to try out a new place and i love tapas
i really enjoyed the food
there seemed to be a wide_selection_of food and the price was reasonable too
we probably ordered too much food
we each ordered tapas to share among six of us as well as rice and naan_bread
but we gave it a good go of eating as much as we could
they did forget two dishes and i did remind them of one dish
as i really wanted to try it
and they brought it straight away so it wasn't an issue
the food was fab
service was good and the food arrived quickly enough
i would_definitely_go_back
this is the only place in edinburgh which reaches my expectations of home_cooked food in the sub continent
the place is very friendly
the staff is helpful and food is mesmerizing
i can not really criticize anything about this place
it is also relatively cheaper to a lot of nasty take away's in edinburgh
the only thing i am confused about is how is this place cheap and nice at the same time
got to be a high five for mother_india
myself and a few old workmates having all four of us gone our separate ways from the citi arena now congregate monthly for a tuesday curry club
the idea was to try a different place every month
we've been going for two months now
this place both times
now i'm worried we may never see another indian restaurant
but in fairness if going to mother_india once a month is a worry
i don't know what i'm smoking
it's tremendous
setting itself up as an indian tapas deal
meaning you get to try a bunch of dishes at the same time
as opposed to the standard sit_down affair offered by other restaurants en masse
good thing about tuesday curry club
besides the curry
is that it consists of growing boys with healthy appetites
with so much on offer
it means we can get away with ordering a ridiculous amount of food
and with the tapas_style we can order even more if we feel we've under supplied ourselves
what did we have
what did we have
there was
lamb karahi
chilli garlic chicken
chilli chicken dosa
baby aubergine and potatoes
vegetable_pakora
chicken_breast curry
chilli king prawns
so good we ordered portions
mutton curry
daily special
of which there are
daily
peshwari_naan
garlic_naan
paratha
rice
we had so much food we couldn't see the table
we had so much food we had to admit defeat
leaving some pakora and aubergine to be returned while we hung our heads in shame
considering we got all the above plus soft_drinks for a head
people
of us had to work late sadly
shows what a bargain mother_india is
always busy so book ahead
staff are delightful
chatty and happy to leave you to it once your food's down
a must try for lovers of indian_cuisine
tuesday curry club
december location
you guessed it
indian tapas is the future
we followed the menu advice and ordered or dishes between and naan rice
the food was reasonably_priced at around per dish and it was great being able to try new dishes
i'd recommend trying the delicious ice_cream also if you can leave room for it
definitely worth a visit
oh mama
what morselesque deliciousness
complex spice combinations made each of the dishes distinctive
the creamy lamb stew
the cilantro chicken
the baby eggplant with potatoes
the spiced halibut
they were all delicious in their very own way
together with a bottle of
dry
not sweet
cooled ros wine
this was a perfect meal
each dish left behind a lingering
full bodied aftertaste
that
not much unlike old bordeaux
made you close your eyes to enable full concentration on this sensory encounter of the indian kind
besides this short lasting anti social effect
the tapas_style food gives rise to a very communal experience
and the place thus pulsates in a lively atmosphere
thus
mother_india is a good idea for romantic t te t tes
as the night already starts off in a very sensual and interactive manner
definitely worth a visit if you're in edinburgh
the butter_chicken wasn't my favorite but still good
i would choose a different chicken dish next time though
the vegetable_pakoras and saag_paneer were both delicious
the saag_paneer was spicy but nothing overwhelming
it had the perfect amount if heat
for good indian food in edinburgh this is the place to go
of us came to the mother india's cafe for a well needed after work feed
i was quite intrigued about a tapas small plate style indian restaurant
being one of my favorite cuisines i had been really looking_forward to it all day
and it didn't disappoint
the restaurant looks like a cafe from outside
in fact
if there wasn't the amazing smell of indian food coming from the place
you'd be forgiven for thinking it was a coffee shop
the decor inside is a little basic but it looks nice and it works really well
between us we ordered dishes and rice
the stand out dishes for me were the methi keema mutter which was delicious minces lamb with peas
and aloo_gobi with green beans
advertised as small plates
i expected small plates
but they were a really decent size
there was a little bit left in a few of our bowls plates as we were all completely full
mother india's cafe do have some traditional curry dishes on the menu
but this isn't a tradition 'british' curry_house
it is a brilliant adaptation of indian_cuisine
while the location of voujon is slightly off the beaten track
i would thoroughly recommend the restaurant to anyone looking for quality indian_cuisine
the waiters were immensely patient with our large_party
service was excellent
and this was matched by the high_quality food and wide range of dishes available
very good value_for_money too
voujon prides itself with modern
ish
indian and bengali food to the extent where it has positive_reviews in its restaurant window from various local papers or diners who has testified
dont let these fool you though
voujon isnt as great as it claims
the 'modern' cooking is uninspiring
and totally lacking the flavours that traditional_indian food would deliver in an instant
this pretty much described the dissapointment we felt for the whole meal lacking that certain something
the punch as it were
the food generally tasted like something you could buy from a supermarket
but was way more expensive
however
voujon has some redeeming features the restaurant is beautifully modern and elegant and the staff were helpful
overall
voujon was a dissapointment and i doubt voujon will post this review in its window
i went to the bengali and indian restaurant voujon for the first time a_few_weeks_ago and since then i have been back twice
they serve traditional and authentic indian dishes which are full_of_flavour
i have had a few of their curry dishes and my favourite is the king prawn bhuna which is very tasty and quite spicy but not too much that it ruins your meal
the dishes at voujon are all very well presented and the foo is reasonably_priced
with main meals around and there is an extensive veggie menu available as well
they offer several different_types_of rice and there is plenty of variety of side dishes to accompany your meal
the decor inside is very authentic and modern whilst the staff have always been very attentive and warm
voujon also do takeaways and is available for private functions
this place promises a lot
apart from anything else it's refreshing to find an indian resturant close to the city centre which isn't full of rowdy groups lured in by the cheap food and bring_your_own bottle policy
unfortunately
it doesn't quite deliver everything it promises
there's no denying that the d_cor is beautiful the solid oak furniture and linen tablecloths certainly give the place an upmarket feel
but when main_courses are around without any rice or naans you would expect something more from the food than it actually delivers
that said
they offer a handful of set banquets for two people which work out at roughly per head including starters right through to main_courses
although my friends that i ate there with said that theirs was pretty bland and dull
i wouldn't go as far as saying it was a bad meal
but i haven't been in a mad rush to go back to voujon since my first visit
i came to voujon with my flatmates a few months_ago and
whilst the service and atmosphere were excellent
the food wasn't quite up to the same standard as some other indian_restaurants in the area
the decor feels modern
fresh and clean with plenty of neatly laid_out tables and really comfortable seats
the staff are attentive
friendly and know everything about the menu which always helps when you have no_idea_what to expect from a certain dish
i went for the tandoori_chicken kebabs with rice which didn't take long to arrive
but tasted a litle dry
the salad it was served with was fresh and there were some great flavours going on
yet it was just lacking some sauce
i'd probably come to voujon agai
but i just expected a little more from the food
reasonably good curry
although not as good as the reviews on the window claim
i agree with the other reviews that it promises more than it really delivers
can't disagree more with most of the other reviews
i have been a regular here for a good few years now and rate it as one of the best indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
food is always great
value excellent and staff fantastic
i have tried a lot of the other indian_restaurants
highly rated on yelp
and found none to be a patch on voujon
tasty curry with plenty of options to choose from
attentive staff
and a relaxed atmosphere
great option if you are inbthe arwa and are looking for great curry
if ever i feel the need for a take away
and i want to make a feast out of it
this is where i come
the reason is simple
the food here is great
and the portions are massive
a huge menu of curries
indian dishes and kebabs are on offer at chilli connestion as well as all the side orders and starters you could ever want
the food is spiced to perfection
the sauces are flavoursome and rich with plenty of meat in them
the naan breads are huuuuuge
and are always soft and perfectly_cooked
chilli_connection has a quick delivery service
which you can order online for or ring up for
my only criticsm of chilli_connection is sometimes the service in the actual shop is poor
but for the amount of time you spend in there
this is nothing
chilli_connection offers great indian takeaway food at reasonable_prices considering the size of the portions
the selection of curries is plentiful with just about any meat served in balti
dhansk
masala or virtually any other conceivable spices combination
on top of this they serve a selection of naan breads
kebabs and rices to really quell your hunger
the first time i visited this curry_house was just prior to a night out when my friends and i reckoned some spicy food would set us right up for a night on the tiles
i ordered the spicy chicken_wings with chilli sauce and when they said 'spicy' they meant spicy
one mouthful in and i had the full works watery eyes
runny nose and my mouth felt_like a firework had just exploded in it
the surprising thing was that it still tasted amazing
there was genuine flavour as opposed to just raw heat and spice which can only be a sign of quality cooking
i would certainly recommend chilli_connection in terms of flavour and value
if you ask any university of edinburgh student who has lived in newington where a great takeaway is
chilli_connection will almost certainly be the answer
it seems to have gone down in folklore as the place to get curry
kebabs or pizzas in that part_of_town
this reputation is helped by the location
on south clerk street
this is right on the route most students staying at pollock halls of residence
near holyrood park
will take home from a night out
you can quite easily fall into chilli_connection
and come out minutes_later with some wholesome takeaway goodness
let's be honest the food is nothing_to_write_home_about
it's fairly unremarkable takeaway quality food
it is the location of this place that makes it worthy of four stars
having sampled one of the their pizzas at some unearthly hour in the morning
it very much hit_the_spot
as anything would have done at the that time
prices_are_reasonable
and service is ok
chilli_connection are a great default option for any takeaway needs you might have
whilst others may have better quality food
you'd be a fool not to check out such a legend
a_few_weeks_ago i would have said that chilli_connection is a great place to stop by to grab your lunch or dinner
the food is tasty and the service is friendly and very fast which is good as you don't have to hang around for a while waiting for your order
the menu is very expansive and they offer a set menu for two people with starters
main_dishes
rich
poppadoms and side bits for which is very reasonably
the main_dishes are in the region of and they have good selection of veggie dishes to
however
they failed a health inspector report in march as the staff failed to wash their hands and there were mouse droppings on the floor
the owners have since said that have completely cleaned up the place
but it does make you think twice about going there fore food which is a shame as the food is quite wonderful
fresh enough
tasty enough and cheap enough chilli_connection is a kebab
curry and pizza place which ticks enough boxes but doesn't particularly stand out
i hadn't been here in a while
before last_night maybe months
however i had a craving for a cheap and cheerful curry rather than my normal preference for a great curry
chilli_connection fills that need
a set meal for only costs and it includes a popedom
some vegetable_pakora and a choice of classic curry with either rice or nan
in short you get a big bag of food for less than the curry alone costs elsewhere
all be it for a better dish
the shop looks a little worse for wear however the curries are good enough
packed with meat and for the price great value
chilli_connection is an ideal place to sooth those post pub food cravings
usually limiting the notion of indian breakfasts to the remnants of the previous nights takeaway
i was pleasantly_surprised by iman's exotic delights
admittedly
i had a little trouble interpreting the owners indian accent and took the safe bet of ordering the breakfast special
ghana puri halwa
see picture
arriving on a shiny metallic platter complete with a pot of ghana
a kind of spicy chickpea dahl
halwa
a bizarre sweet tasting puree
flavour unknown to me
and some moreish puri
a kind of lightly fried flour tortilla
it seemed i was in for a feast
rich
spicy
and flavoursome i found this dish a great way to start the day and at
and it's cheap enough too
in typical brit fashion i was left with a chilli heat induced sweat on my brow and a yearning for a cold beer
nonetheless
i'll be back for more
i hadn't been down here in a while and all of a sudden i came across this new kid and what a pleasant meeting it was
it's sort of an indian bakery that caters for breakfasts and lunches
delicious treats and exotic meals await you here
i tried their version of halwa
we won't get into here about who made it first etc
and it was sickly sweet just like it should be
at affordable prices this shop became the highlight of my saturday wander
would most definitely come here again
imans takeaway offer a delightful range of foods that i at least have not tried before
the food on offer is reasonably_priced
yet even if this were not the case you would still treat yourself to food from here every now and then
as it is you can regularly treat yourself to the culinary delights on offer here
the location of this shop enhances your likelihood of a visit as although the area offers many opportunities for bacon rolls
this is one of a kind for the area
my main recommendation would be to try something new every time you come as there is a great range on offer here all at good prices
i've never eaten a full meal here
i only come in for all the different_types_of indian sweets
which i'm not going to try and spell
my mumu spent part of her childhood in india
so i remember being introduced to these amazing sweets at an early age
and this place is by far the best place i've found in edinburgh to stock up on all things punjabi and sugary
with the wall to wall counter stocked with all sorts of amazing sights and smells
if you're out and about in this part of tollcross and fancy afternoon tea with a difference
you shoud get yourself in here
my personal favourite is the kulfi
ok
so it's made with evaporated milk
double cream and condensed milk
but it'll be worth the hours you'll be spending in the gym afterwards i promise
so far i've tried the pistachio and plain flavour
and the mango is next on my list
they're about to open up another branch on nicolson street
which is just along from my flat
very excited
byob is always a winner in my eyes it means an extra course of food and a lovely drink
a friend hosted people at this restaurant and i was impressed by the fact that they managed to bring all our orders at the same time it did take quite awhile but bearing in mind that we are talking_about completely different orders i thought that was impressive
their poppadoms were scrumptious as well and the staff very friendly
their menu_is_extensive perhaps too extensive
with house specialities
family specialities
regional specialities and a lot of choice
even a small section for british food should you happen to decide upon entering this indian food establishment that you don't want indian food but would rather opt for fish and chips
portions are ok the best value would most certainly be the half tandoori_chicken
but i was impressed by all the dishes i sampled names i have promptly forgot after my third glass of vino
a great place to get your indian food kick in the area
my favourite in edinburgh
food is mostly the usual curry_house fare but all done well
inexpensive when you consider the quality
staff friendly and service good
byob a huge bonus
really great food and fantastic service
i suggest you experiment a little and try something new
everything we had was delicious
it's byob
so don't forget to bring_your_own wine or beer
my first trip here was for an office xmas night out and it surpassed my expectations
we were loking for a byob indian and so decided it was worth a try based_on some good reviews
there were of us in total ans it's xmas party season so i guess i was prepared for things to be a little chaotic but was pleasantly_surprised when there was a number of staff ready and waiting for us
we had been placed in the back room which on the plus side is private so we could be ourselves and not have to worry too much about who's next to you
my_only_complaint was that it was probably a bit too small for us and we did feel a bit crammed in however that seemed quickly forgotten when the staff arrived with plates of poppadoms and dips and of course plenty corkscrews to assist us in opening wine
we had the course festive menu at
per head and i'm still struggling to figure_out how they managed to make a profit from it
the deal included poppadoms n dips
the restaurant then provided everyone with a rather generous plate of starters including
pakora
samosas and bhajis each with a small side salad each item was a good size and everyone managed to clear their plates good start
being gluten_free i made them aware and was treated to my very own selection of gf starters including chicken_tikka
lamb skewers and bombay potatoes fantastic
for main everyone was asked to choose what they wanted from the a la_carte menu
nothing was out of bounds and there was a fantastic range of chicken
lamb and seafood dishes
i opted for one of mum's home_cooked specials
desi saag chicken
which was really tasty and spicy but not overly so
this was accompanied_by as much white and brown_rice and naan breads as we could eat
and boy did we give them a run for their money but it just kept coming
dessert was ice_cream
but with their very own ice_cream shop next_door and flavours
turkish delight seemed popular
we were not disappointed
throughout the meal the staff were really friendly struck a good balance of being there when you need them but lft us to enjoy our evening
even when the singing started towards the end they were fantastic
it made for a fantastic work night out and evryone was ravving about it at work after with many
including me
definately planning a return_visit
byob proper punjabi food
great service
reasonable_prices for really good food
on par with home_cooked punjabi food
atmosphere was lively
lots of large groups
the loo's need attention i'm not sure about the decor but i'd certainly visit again for starters mains
a lovely venue
and the food is fabulous
if somewhat overpriced at lunchtime
be prepared to savour what you get
though the service is s l o w
i fell out of the stand late one night with a choice on my hands
chippy or try cellars
i'm_so_glad i chose the later
don't let the front fool you
this place is like the tardis
i'm not sure if there are cellars exactly but the place is huge
that's brings me to the restuarants biggest problem
it's always empty
now i'm not saying the venue itself is lacking
but when there are no people around you do lose the atmosphere
the food is wonderful
i had nalli gosht and the lamb was perfect
cooked exactly right
i also had half of my girlfriend's lal mass
this place makes me a bad boyfriend
please visit
it deserves your custom
i came here with my flatmates late last year before a flat party in old town
it was a thursday evening and we all got a discount because apparantly that's what they give everyone on thursdays to sundays
i almost took this as a sign of desperation
but the food and quality of service proved that it's actually a great restaurant
the menu has a good range of meat and vegetarian curries which are all authentic to india and are drawn from its numerous regions
i opted for the lamb_rogan_josh which was quickly prepared and and quickly eaten as it tasted so good
it had a delicious blend_of_spices and the lamb was tender with virtually no fat
this
along with a chapati and a coke came to just over which i thought was pretty reasonable
cellars is right next to the the stand comedy club and so is ideal eating in before the show
i have to say i was disappointed when someone told me this was the best indian in edinburgh
i wanted to try some indian while i was in the uk since it's suppose to be better than what we have in the us
i'm still confident uk indian is better than the us but i will need another place to corroborate that
on the plus side
the staff is really nice and attentive
first of all
i confused myself
as i have been calling this place indian thali as i swear that is what it says above the door and not cellars
but
for a place that hides itself away next_door to the stand
you can easily miss it
as my friend has done
walking past it on a daily basis for years
but if you do
i suspect secretly you would regret it
it does do thali and has a separate menu for it
for up to thirteen pounds
you will be filled to sufficiency on some of the nicest indian food in the area
if you read my reviews
then you might argue that i say that about nearly everywhere or i just have good taste
don't argue with me
i can't reply easily with words of an appropriate calibre on a review site
with a choice of dishes along with daal
poori or chapatti
rice and pickles raita
i don't recommend the poori
unless you are a lover of all things deep_fried
but the rest of my meal was fabulous and the empty plates for all four of us with constant mumbles of delight proved how good it was
you may note that each dish is pretty tiny
but looks can be deceiving all of us were stuffed by the end
if you have the vegetarian thali
i totally recommend the aubergine dish it is smoky deliciousness with a good kick
the meat thali were successes as well lamb_rogan_josh
chicken with spinach
butter_chicken and so on
i almost forgot to mention the starters
prawns marinaded lime and caron seeds and then deep_fried dry of oil and grease the pakoras my dinner dates shared looked equally so
a special note of the main menu as well had a lovely varied menu with lots of interesting dishes to try over and above your staple choices
all in all
if i had known this was called cellars in the first place
i would have known this was a gem from the yelp_reviews
not only with the standard of food we had but also in the service as well
as it happened
i didn't check yelp
but i tried and loved it anyway
sometimes it is good to be bold
dropping down a wee bit as my last visit took come edge off my ardour for cellars
firstly
thali isn't served at the weekend
boo
so we had to choose from the main menu
the boy decided to try the chicken dosa
which he found lookwarm and not particularly tasteful
mainly disappointment fore than anything else
i tried a spinach
vegetable and dried fruit curry which was lacking in fruit
a stuffed parantha with spinach and garlic was also lacking in flavour
service was spotty and this is a personal gripe why is it when a glass_of_water is ordered alongside an alcoholic drink
does the water always get omitted
anyway
definitely less impressed perhaps it was because it was busy
or i just prefer the thali experience
but i'm a little less enamoured now than i was before
and i slip further down the star scale
i'm just not as impressed as i was the first time i visited and i don't know why
the thali we had this time was burnt and too spicy for me
dhaal watery and lacking in lentils
rice overcooked enough to lose texture
lime pickle that was as tough as old boots
ajwani jinga prawns
supposedly flavoured with lime juice and caron seeds
semi covered in breadcrumbs
mainly tasting of oil and prawn
i'm sad
but at the moment it's fails out of
service was on the otherhand getting warmer than previously experienced
but overall
i am less impressed than i would like to be
with it's swanky lago
clean and crisp interior and the odd incense stick burning away on the counter
the curry_leaf is a refreshing alternative to your usual take away curry
out of ideas and with little patience to cook for myself i've opted for the curry leaf's classic lamb_rogan_josh on many occasion
followed by their light and fluffy naan breads
the classic dishes are inexpensive and with a home delivery service i see no reason to claim that the curry_leaf offers everything you could possibly want from a indian take away service
top stuff
my flatmates and i was first made aware of the curry_leaf when they posted a flyer with their menu under the door of our flat
it literally sat there on the doormat for about two months until one night in december
whilst in the throes of exams
we decided to order a curry
their menu_is_extensive
offering chicken
beef or lamb in a wide_variety of sauces and all for more or less the same price
further
they serve vegetable curries for only about
i ordered the lamb balti with plain rice and a shawermah naan
in total
and including delivery
it came to between four of us which seemed like a lot but it was delicious and we were absolutely stuffed by the end of it
we even had left_overs to put in the fridge for lunch_the_next_day
my only criticism is that the shawermah naans turned_out_to_be just plain despite us paying extra for them
regardless
however
the curry_leaf serves excellent food at reasonable_prices and is definitely worth a visit for a late_night indian feast
started just over a year_ago
curry_leaf is one of the most upscale indian takeouts i've been to in edinburgh
it's owned by a friendly guy called riaz
pictured
with his very friendly pose
it's located in the peaceful area of bruntsfield and is the only one of its kind that i'm aware of in the area
strictly a take out business
there's not even the pretence of a table or two
and from the semi long wait and cooking sounds i could make out in the background
the food's freshly_made
and it tastes that way
it was a friend's delicious meal of chicken bhuna and peshwari_naan that led me there
i suppose i have simple tastes
but i'm more enchanted by this naan than anything else
it has coconut in it
definitely a great side to the meal
which also didn't disappoint
the rest of the menu is quite extensive
and is very fancily worded
it's more expensive than your typical take out
but once you take a look at the menu and the d_cor you'll figure_out why
hoocha wawa
my take away heaven
fresh
simple and hot
the curry_leaf in bruntsfield is so unlike the standard take aware fare that it deserves it's own yellow pages category
i don't stray too much up and down the menu these days
sticking with the gourmet jalfresi and a brace of chapati
it's damn hot
but gets those endorphins screaming
what's more it's licensed to sell beer so you're never going to get caught out at home sucking an ice cube and crying like a baby when you've chewed through a chilli
portions are big
but probably match the price
i'm not a huge_fan_of the rice the first couple_of_times i ordered i felt i had to have it
but i think it's better with a couple of chapatti now
i'm going to keep on coming_back until my chilli gland shrivels and dies and leaves me to korma hell
no cure for common cold
i wanted a really spicy curry to clear me of the dangers of the imminent cold i felt coming on
and was driving home from work through bruntsfield
knowing very little about the curry_houses of brunters i took pot luck at this place
it's a well presented take away
which was part of the allure
and i had heard about them before
the menu was relatively standard
and i chose a jalfrezi as i know this is a standard safe bet spicy number
garlic_naan and a couple side dishes yes i know
i am a pig
so
firstly
flavour levels were low
particularly in the curry
naan was fine and sides were a complete non event
secondly
there was next to no spice in this curry
now i know the brits apparently can't_handle spice
but i can
and was bitterly disappointed at the lack of effort here
seriously
take my advice and don't waste your time
my first experience of holi spice was an odd one i had made an order for take away and when i went to collect it their card machine wasn't working
so they gave it to me for free
with free popadoms
i felt quite bad though
and after eating the meal
which was delicious
i went back with cash
the food is delicious
really yummy and full_of_flavour
everything is made fresh to order
my favourite is the chicken_korma
which is as good as any i've ever had
as the indian is also a restaurant
however
i always feel really uncomfortable walking in
i've only ever seen one table eating when i've been in
all the other times it has been empty
as a result
the staff are extremely attentive and were pouring over themselves to serve me
giving me freebies left
right and centre
i always choose to collect the food myself as i only live minutes away and i like to think i'm burning the calories i
m about to consume
but they also have free delivery
i really hope holi spice survives
it's a really good indian and the staff are lovely
this venue tends to change hands a worrying amount i'm sure the last time i walked past it on my way to an exam at st
leonard's it was a tapas place
nevertheless
my flatmate and i thought we'd give it a try
there was nothing massively different between it and any_other_indian_restaurant you'll find in edinburgh all the usual suspects are on the menu and they're all under a tenner
but what was good about this place
apart from the fact that it's just across_the_street from the holyrood a for a beer afterwards
was that they lso had a load of more random curry dishes on the menu too
like the mohonwala which comes with mango pulp
coconut
almond
cream and fresh cheese
the annoying thing though
is that depending_on what meat you get your curry with it almost doubles in price for even the most basic curry made with king prawn will cost you
whilst the veggies among you will only have to pay a fiver for the same dish
also
although they do have all these other less known curries that i was mentioning before
they're all twice the price too
i'm a penny pinching student
which is why i'm whingeing so much
if you're not
you'd probably like this place as the service is great and the food is tasty
they also do carry_out delivery too
so if you can't even be bothered to leave your sofa you can still get in on the action
not bad
i must say
though the masala curry was oddly sweet
my brother and i ate here our first night in town
and quite enjoyed it
the lamb naan was very
very good
the chicken pakoras were oddly slimy inside
though
like some of the batter hadn't been cooked thoroughly
chicken was cooked
though
so all's good
delicious chutneys and sauces for the papadum
so that was great
i was very surprised by passage to india
i was given an extremely warm welcome by the manager and he pulled the chair out for my girlfriend
touch of old school class
i ordered the chicken shashlik on a recommendation and i wasn't disappointed
big chunky kebabs marinated in a mild curry_sauce with safron infused rice
heaven
the best part was the price
both of us ate for and we got glasses of wine on the house
as a rule
i tend to find you can judge an indian restaurant by the smell when you first walk in
this useful tip has come in very handy more than once i have found and
i am proud to say
my nose didnt let me down for passage to india
my mouth was watering by the time i had sat_down at my table
and had ordered my drink with the most friendly_staff member i had ever met he was funny
helpful and just all round nice
the food was certainly not a dissapointment my lamb masskai was beautiful
and all the sundries we had ordered were just as good
the price was also pretty good with of us dining for around each
which was the cherry on top of an already good cake
the thing which first attracted my mates and i to passage to india was its name and original sign
this place is definitely not just any ordinary restaurant
and i would even go so far as to say that it is flawless
from the moment we walked in we were greeted like old friends by one of the friendliest waiters i've ever met
the decor is stylish and unique and the tasbles all seem perfectly placed to give a comfortable atmosphere
the menu_is_extensive and has a good range of kormas
tandoori specials and other authentic indian dishes
i ordered the lamb tikka
plain rice and a naan which all arrived pretty quickly and tasted incredible
the sauce was amazingly creamy and had a good blend_of_spices whilst the lamb was clearly of the best quality
we each spent about
on a great
filling meal and some real indian beer
i would recommend passage to india any day for both impeccable food and service
passage to india is just another curry_house serving up dishes with muddled flavors that won't excite you
paratha was a bit dense and came to the table when i was half way through my curry
i did a curry tour of edinburgh while i was there on holiday
see
i eat curry and spicy food like nobody's business i eat food so hot that i've literally watched others cry over a mere taste at my food
so
i decided to hit a different indian_joint each night while i was in the city in search of the most flavorful and spiciest_curry
this place was pretty good
the staff were more interested in chatting with each other than serving
which i'm not opposed to as a rule but it wasn't the most welcoming atmosphere
also
the prices were a bit higher_than i expected
which sort of put me off
and
since i'm complaining
my request for the dish to be
extra extra_spicy
was obviously not taken seriously because i could've poured my meal into my eyes and it wouldn't have hurt
that aside
the atmosphere was very elegant and simultaneously welcoming
which was nice
and the food was very delicious
i'm not sure i've ever had a tastier dal
lentil
dish than the one i had here
that i had to bring my own thai chile peppers to add even a zest of spice was unfortunate but the chef's ability to bring out subtle flavor was extremely impressive redeeming in and of itself
so
not edinburgh's spiciest_curry and never going to come close
but it sure tasted good
my flatmates and i visitited tikka mahal shortly_after it first opened during the summer last year
the menu looked entising and relatively cheap from the outside so we decided_to_give it a go
the decor inside was pretty nice with newly painted yellow walls shiny mirrors
it's intended to be a takeaway as well a restaurant and probably does equal trade through both
we decided to sit in and we all ordered a curry with rice and a naan
i opted for the chicken rogan_josh which didn't take too long to arrive and tasted great when it did
the portions were also excellent and the meal only cost us about each
my only criticism is that at that time we were probably some of their first customers and they were keen to see what our reactions were to the food
so it felt_like we were being constantly watched whilst trying to eat which was irritating
i doubt you'd have that problem if you went now though
and tikka mahal is a well priced indian with great food
tikka mahal is fairly recent on the takeaway scene in edinburgh and it has made a pretty big impression on me
situated in the newington area of edinburgh
tikka mahal is just a short walk from the city centre and it is very close to the university so it is a convenient place for students to go to for dinner
despite being called tikka mahal
giving the impression that it is a curry_house
they also do kebabs
burgers
pizzas and fish and chips so a bit of everything
i came in with a friend who ordered a chicken_korma curry with rice which he said was really tasty and the rice was well cooked
i had a burger and chips which also tasted really good and the portions were a decent size
our meals came to about five pounds each which was a really good deal
there is quite a substantial dining_area inside the shop
and tikka mahal also does takeaways as well as home deliveries which is incredibly convenient
i haven't been back since but i had a good experience here i definitely plan to go back
i absolutely love tikka mahal
it is the only place for indian pakistani food in edinburgh
they are very gracious when you walk in
and all food is prepared fresh to order
the quality of the chicken is fantastic
and you never get weird chewy parts like i often find at other cheap establishments
both the chicken karahi and the chicken rogan_josh are divine
they roll our the naan_bread fresh right there for you
i'm_a_huge_fan
chicken_korma takeaway was delicious sweet sauce and tender chicken huge portion one order was enough for people
enough sauce for both rice and nan
cheese nan was giant and awesome
part kebab shop and part curry_house tikka makal does a good solid curry and decent pakora all for a very reasonable_price
however there is nothing particularly special about it
the curries are prepared fresh while you wait and it is a reasonable sized portion
which is nice however there isn't a massive variance in the flavours of the curries
in short there are better choices
all be it a little more expensive
in the area
however tikka mahal is normally fairly quiet and is certainly good enough to satisfy the indian comfort_food craving
while in edinburgh on holiday
i went on a curry tour
see
i eat spicy food like you breathe air
back home
i get my take away and add both habaneros and ghost pepper hot_sauce before i eat it
my spice tolerance is ridiculously high
i've also eaten curry on three separate continents
so i know my curries pretty well
so
i picked a different indian_joint each night and went on a search for the most flavorful and spiciest_curry
i came onto this place midway through my adventure
it is very much a diner style indian restaurant with a very casual
laid back atmosphere
it is family_run the father in charge did most of the translating to the staff that prepared and served my food
there wasn't a vegan friendly vindaloo on the menu but there were several meat based vindaloos
so i asked if it would be possible to order a vegetable vindaloo
the father quickly assured me that would be okay so i ordered it extra_spicy with rice and chapati
now
i don't want to gripe
the prices here were very cheap
and the food was flavorful as anyone could ever hope for
seriously
but
what i ate wasn't a vindaloo
i wonder if maybe the chef just made me a vegetable_curry instead and hoped i didn't know better
so
it was very delicious and i won't complain_about that
but it wasn't spicy and it wasn't a vindaloo
luckily i brought along three thai chile peppers to spice it up
of course
thai chile peppers to me are about as spicy as cinnamon to most people
but still
it definitely helped bring out the inherent and distinct flavors of the dish
so
the food wasn't spicy but i'd come again just because of the place's affordability and their willingness to accommodate customer wishes
good on you
mates
i wanted good and family_run kind of indian restaurant in my last day in edinburgh
i found this restaurant on tripadvisor and lucky that i did
i ordered chicken with okra in some kind of curry_sauce and garlic_naan bread
topped with a mango_lassi
all that for under british pound
wow
food is made fresh to order
it was a little greasy but god everything is so tasty i don't mind at all
and the mango_lassi comes in a pint
no kidding
too much for one person really but i had my water bottle with me so i poured the excess into it for later
tasty
good
honest
family_style indian food for so little money
portions are big
i skipped lunch and only had a snack since breakfast so i devoured everything
i probably could not have if i had had a regular sized lunch
well
the other customers tend to take the leftovers home so i guess that it is okay too
what a great find and wonderful way to stay warm in a cool and damp fall evening in scotland
family_run curry_house in a similiar style to kebab mehal
and offers the usual array of indian food options
inexpensive
hearty and good food with those qualities you cannot go wrong really
its not a restaurant but more of a kebab curry take away so the decor is minimal with a resonable ammount of chairs and tables for patrons
i like the price
the food and the service
definately worth a look if you fancy a cheap lunch time meal deal or a cheap but tasty biryani in the evening
this restaurant just opened days_ago
so there were some glitches and service was a bit shaky because there were two people trying to serve the tables and orders were mixed up a bit
they have both lunch and dinner buffets
lunch is
and dinner is
the weekend buffet goes to
and i don't know if there is anything different to make weekends more expensive
i had the buffet and my wife had saag chicken
her dish was very good
she asked for it not spicy at all
there was some spiciness
but she could live with that and it's good that she is growing in her tastes
the buffet was good except for a major glitch which soon smoothed out
something happened to the heated water under the steamers
and some of the food had cooled somewhat before they got it back up to piping_hot
i won't remember all the dishes but they had vegetable_samosa
a spicy lentil dish
chana_masala
aloo palak
jeera rice
chicken_korma
tandoori_chicken
chili beef
and gulab jamon
except for the temperature issue
the buffet food was quite good
i tried some dishes i have never had and it was all good
the gulab jamon was outstanding the first time i've had this dessert
one issue we had was with an order of garlic_nan
there was no garlic
there was a mixup in orders
he deleted the amount from the bill
we will_be_returning and it's close_to_home
so i can to take out
too
the brochure syas they have live music and karaoke thursday through sunday
the owner promised to play something for us
but he got too busy helping out
this is a small suite in the village square plaza a few doors east of the regal cinemas and next_door to the coldstone creamery store
capacity is rated at people
so it's a small place
if you go to their_website
you can download their menu as an excel spreadsheet
i loved this restaurant
i travel all over the country and always eat indian if i can
vegetarian friendly
gluten_free friendly
casual atmosphere
the staff is overwhelmingly nice
warm
friendly
by the time we left
i felt_like they were friends
i let them pick out my food using my gluten_free restrictions and was amazed with my meal
the bhel poori was so unique and filled with flavor
the dosa tasted like the dosa's that i ate in india
the owner
s
sang songs and entertained us unexpectedly
we meant to pop into the restaurant for a quick meal
we left feeling like we had a casual night out on the town with new friends
go eat at pyaars
then go back
this place is near a movie theater and is so new that it had no sign yet
find it
it will not disapoint
best priced indian food in vegas
they have only been open a week and were having some trouble with their oven
so the naan wasn't great
the food was way too salty but was otherwise great for their first week
their chef used to work at gaylord indian at the rio so i was surprised that their dishes tasted very different than at gaylord
not bad different
just different
harold the owner is a great person to chat with and service was outstanding
i will give them another chance in a few days and see if they have the kinks worked out
i can see giving it more stars next time
this is a very tough review for me to write
on our trip to pyaar the one good thing i can say about the restaurant is the owners are some of the nicest and most accommodating people you could hope to meet
unfortunately
i really didn't like my meal here
it should also be noted that this is a review only of the dinner buffet it's possible that ala_carte menu ordering will produce a different experience
anyway
when my wife and i discovered a new indian restaurant was opening in town we were pleased
but the news that this one would feature an indian dinner buffet had us over the moon
we are night owls by nature and during vacation times or on weekends we aren't always ready to go in time for a lunch buffet the chance of a dinner option for indian buffet sounded perfect
tonight we went in with no expectations
or so per_person for dinner seemed like a good deal
although we were surprised that naan had to be purchased separately
it's usually included with the buffet this is the first time i've seen it as an extra
the selection was small and i ran into immediate problems
i'm not sure if this is synonymous with the particular cuisine pyaar aims at they claim to me
the only north south mogul indian_restaurant_in_vegas
but i was surprised at the presence of a couple of beef dishes
the lack of any real
main
dish for vegetarians and nothing at all with the nice sauces i've come to expect from indian food
no paneer dish
no chicken_tikka_masala or chicken_makhani
no samosas
no pakora
no kofta of any sort
what i ended_up with was the only two tandoori_chicken drumsticks
some of the very wet
chilli beef
some of the vegetable_curry and a lot of rice
the tandoori_chicken was fine if unspectacular and i'd have been ok to eat that and write it off as a
notch in the belt
but not somewhere i wanted to visit again
but unfortunately the rest of the tandoori was thighs which i don't like
the chilli beef tasted like a generic beef stew with a bit of chilli powder added
potatoes were ok ish but a bit hard in the vegetable_curry
my vegetarian wife fared even worse than me ending up with some chick_peas and a bit of potato on top of a bed of basmati_rice
by the time our naan
which tasted like a flour tortilla
arrived i realised that i had nothing to mop up as there was no dish featuring any of the delicious gravies i have come to associate with indian food
around minutes into the meal my wife pretended to receive an urgent phone call and we apologised and asked for the check
the owners felt bad for us and were extremely nice
offering to let us fill up to go boxes from the buffet and they waived the cost of the naan
now
perhaps it's a different type of indian_cuisine and it's just our personal taste
but we really didn't like the buffet here at all
i feel bad having to pan this place so harshly because i really liked the owners
but i hope if they read this review they consider some changes to their buffet because right now it's uninspired bordering on inedible
we immediately got a great sense of family in this restaurant
their name is fitting
as
pyaar means love
when we walked into this restaurant
it's as if we were all good friends
meeting together for the first time in years
i'm assuming this is family_owned
the mother
father
and son were more than willing to accommodate us
we aren't regulars at indian_restaurants and the dad was quick to help
we had a mango_lassi
vegetable_samosas
ginger chicken
and chicken biriyani
there was more an enough for leftovers
the icing on the cake was when the dad and son offered to sing play for us
let_me_tell_you
that man does an excellent impression of frank sinatra
sammy davis jr
and louis armstrong
it made my night
i'm sad to hear that the negative reviews are for the buffet
perhaps they should have gone with the menu
like us
a true vintage vegas spectacle
go on friday or saturday nights after for indian food with a live jazz trio
belly_dancing
and occasional impromptu performances from al the singing chef
he's not only the chef
but also the owner and he does a killer louis armstrong impersonation
this is a true must see
food was pretty good
the lunch buffet was small but i liked everything i tried
nan was extra which made my lunch buffet about
not bad especially considering the entertainment
ok confession
my friend susan l drags me places to try_new_things
and i go willingly
she took me to pyaar and i shrugged and said
roh k
so we get their and the first thing i thought was
i am so thankful for air conditioning cuz it is freaking hot outside
we sat_down and it was nice the booth was really roomy and
our hostess
and i am thinking one of the owners
brought us ice water right away
i ordered a strawberry lasse
i think that is the spelling
i thought it was a soda
susan informed me it was a yogurt drink and i wrinkled up my nose
and thought
oh crud i ordered wrong
not being a connoissieur of indian food
i really have a limited idea of what to order
we ended_up ordering biryani
beef
and chicken tandoori sizzler
which was a little like fajitas
and garlic_nan bread
the server hostess owner brought me my strawberry drink
and it was good
bonus
then she brought the biryani
which was served a little differently than i had ever tried before
it had cucumber
onion and fresh tomato sliced around it
it was very good and spicy
so that yogurt drink was perfect
it totally cut the heat immediately
i was not crazy about the tandoori
not my favorite at all
susan enjoyed it alot
she took the left_overs
but this is not a reflection on the whole review
but it is not the best i have tried
the other thing i was not crazy about
is the buffet ended at pm and the food was still in the trays after pm
just kind of
sitting there
however the service was really great
very accomodating
the tandoori usually comes on one plate and she made sure it came on two plates since she knew we would be sharing
i thought that was really cool
she also made sure that our water never got too empty
i thought it was really a good experience
but it is really far away and it isn't a place that i would go to on a regular_basis
i gave it three stars because it was good food
and good service
i was so excited that there was an indian place so close by that i had to try it
the menu has so many things to choose from
they even have chinese_food with an indian twist
i was really tempted to try it but i thought i should stick to the indian dishes first
i started_off_with a blueberry lassi which was really delicious compared to bollywood's mango_lassi
i liked this one better because i could tell it was made out of fresh blueberries by it's texture
my friend sharr and i ordered different items so we can sample more dishes
we ordered the beef biriyani
tandoori_chicken sizzler
and the garlic_naan
the beef biriyani was good on the inside where all the beef and spices were but on the outside it was like white rice
i'm used to having the spices spread throughout
i would have to say i like bollywood's briyani better because of how the spices are spread through out the whole dish and they have a curry_sauce that they serve on the side with it
i was impressed with the tandoori_chicken sizzler
anything that sizzles on a plate gets me instantly excited
i've never had tandoori before so i have nothing to compare it to but i thought it was tasty
the garlic_naan here is flavorful and i like how they pre cut it before it's served
i thought the service here was very thoughtful
the lady who took our order knew we were sharing the chicken so she had it split into two plates
i'd love to come back when they have the live entertainment and sample other items on the menu
this is an indian restaurant my
indian
husband and i will keep_coming_back to in vegas
we had dinner here tonight with a friend from out of town
we ordered a lot of different dishes to share family_style
we started with the papads
which were tasty but didn't come with any chutney
surprising
the mains followed with saag chicken
fish_curry
dal makhni
egg curry
upma
jeera rice
raita and garlic_naan
we felt_like everything had been lovingly prepared
it just had that homemade taste
the stand out dish for me was the egg curry just fantastic and kind of hard_to_find on menus at indian_restaurants in the us
my husband and friend thought the fish_curry was number one
with a fresh tomato taste
only one downside
the naan was just so so kind of tasted like the frozen supermarket naan that they doctored up with garlic and cilantro
to drink
we all ordered fresh lime juices
which were a perfect accompaniment to the foods
the restaurant is working on getting their liquor license within the next few months
in addition to the great food
there was live entertainment with a jazz trio
and singing done by the owner chef
the chef and his wife also came over to chat a few times and make sure everything was ok lovely people
overall
it was a friendly and fun atmosphere and the prices were not ridiculous like at many indian_restaurants_in_town
first off
the set up is beautiful
great atmosphere and they even had a good piece jazz band playing when i walked in
i was expecting something great from the newly opened indian restaurant
but when i had got there
they had miss placed my order
they were out of of the items i ordered
and the food was mundane
although
i was extremely disappointed in the service and the quality of the food
since the staff was extremely apologetic and the setting was impressive
i'm thinking i may give the place a second chance
maybe
i tried to dine here at
on tuesday but they weren't open yet even though the hours posted claimed they opened at
am
i came to pyaar in a roundabout way
you see
i asked the hotel desk clerk if he had a menu for the thai restaurant around the corner
archi's
he said he did but they had changed the name to something else
he fussed around in a drawer
not in his drawers
that would be weird
said
here it is
and handed me a menu for pyaar
i knew right away that indian_cuisine is not thai cuisine
i'm funny that way
while i have enjoyed being curried away at both
the food is distinctly different
anyone that is even a slight foodie is not going to confuse thai food with indian food
so i decided to check them both out
and i decided on indian instead of thai
i was the only one in the restaurant
i tried ordering several things and struck out with an assortment of
we're out of that
and
he only makes that during the day
hint don't put it on the dinner menu
i opted to order several small things
i started with a veggie_samosa
followed with some gobi paratha and to go
rasmalai
i really liked the samosa
the gobi paratha was pretty good
with a nice robust and grainy bread
the rasmalai for dessert was
interesting
very sweet
overall
pretty solid indian
nice people and reasonable_prices
and sanford and son on the tube when i left
too old school for me
went here for the first time the other night
this place is a gem
great food
great atmosphere
definitely a special find here in vegas
i will be back for sure
this is my rd time eating here
and first time eating the buffet
needless_to_say i am not pleased
the buffet was about
and runs from pm
i came in about
i was given water by the owner
and he never asked me if i wanted anything to drink
on the buffet
all of the rice dishes were on the verge of dry and crunchy
the eggplant_dish was very bitter
the vegtable pakoras we dry and unedible
the ground meat
i think beef
was just plain ole funky
the bread that came with it tasted like it was re heated
overall a horrible buffet
during my lunch
i was never asked how things were or if i needed anything
the cook is the one who rang me out when i was leaving and he asked me how things were
and i told_him dry
and not very good
he told me i needed to come in the morning and not so late
so save your money and go somewhere_else
i hate to say it
because i was glad to have a indian restaurant in the neighborhood
but this place isnt going to last and is going down fast
i also noticed in the kitchen that they had
taste_of_india
seasoning pastes
this places says they serve made from scratch dishes
lol
when i ate at this restaurant i almost felt i was in the twilight zone
the owner
harold
and his wife are so friendly it's almost scary
they constantly come to your table and engage in conversation with you
harold asks for everyone's name and remembers it
i'm kind of making this sound like a bad thing
but it's a good thing
a very
very good thing
the world would be a much better place if more people were like them
anyways
they have a lunch buffet and used to have a dinner buffet
but they decided to stop doing that unfortunately
which is a shame as i always like indian food better when i'm able to pick out small portions of various items rather than one large portion of one or two things
indian food sure does fill you up quickly
i decided to just go for it anyway though
my first time here i got veggie_samosas
tandoori_chicken
which literally sizzles as they bring it out for you
and garlic_naan
samosas
huge
they were served with two sauces
one sweet black sauce and another minty cilantro sauce
i really liked the sweet black sauce but the minty cilantro sauce smelled too minty for me to put it in my mouth
the samosas were filled with curried potato and pea flavor
they could have been a little crunchier though
tandoori_chicken
i ordered the piece and i was shocked at how large they were
nice
spicy and tender
very filling too
naan
a little bit too much cilantro
but pretty damn tasty regardless
like naan should always be
would love to return
i would try to do so earlier next time so i can try the buffet
even if the food wasn't that good i would probably still go here just for the so nice it's practically ridiculous service
the worst indian restaurant i have eaten in in the us
i am indian and i will not suggest this to anyone
please avoid at all costs
are you kidding me
you just spent min
telling us how great a vegetarian diet is
you bring us food and every dish has chicken in it
sorry i still don't agree with the whole chicken is a vegetable deal
a little more expensive than i was comfortable with
everything was ala_carte
very strange dining_experience
had a coupon from not groupon
and that sent the owner off into a tizzy about the problems he had with the company
i think it was a off coupon i had purchased
but according to him it was supposed_to_be off
he claimed it was the company's fault
but i think maybe he misunderstood the concept of the groupon like sites
he did honor it
but i felt_like i was the bad guy using it
the food was pretty good
though
but it was all a bit overpriced without a coupon
so i doubt i'll be stopping back in there
my rating is based_on the over all experience
i enjoyed the food
it was fresh and tasty
and there was plenty
i went with a friend_of_mine
the only real reason for not giving it a or greater was the strangeness of our dining_experience
there was no music or any ambient noise and we were the only ones in the restaurant
so it seemed a little eerie
there was no buffet
which i was interested in seeing what they had to offer but was not disappointed because rarely do they have chicken_vindaloo at the buffet which is what i order
vindaloo was good at a on the heat scale and the veg
palau was good too
enough for my friend and i to share with some to take home
a good place to go especially since this is one of the few indian places on this side of town
it's really not fair to rate an indian restaurant based_on its buffet only
unfortunately
i only have that one experience upon which to base my assessment of pyarr
located in village square
just a few doors down from the regal cinemas
pyarr is relatively new
and its obvious it hasn't built up its clientele yet
i visited during the lunch buffet with a friend one weekday
and we were the only other people dining in there aside from one guy at his lonely table
seating was open
but we were promptly greeted and quickly brought water as our drink_orders were being taken
which left us to hit up the buffet
of course
this is where my review gets highly subjective
the buffet selection was
let's say
not impressive
especially not if you're a vegetarian
hello
there were only eight to hot plates from which to choose
and none of these were fried goodies such as samosa
pakora or papadum
the selection does change daily
but i'd rather see pyarr ixnay the bulk of its mostly ignored cold condiment selections to make room for more hot stuff
and maybe they will when business picks up
the buffet does include a serving of their fresh naan
however
and i will say this
i think this is the best naan i've had in vegas
even counting my beloved india_palace
and even though the selection was weak
the food i did have
jeera rice
aloo palak
yellow daal
was tasty and just spicy enough
the service was excellent
we were being checked up on regularly
asked for feedback on specific dishes
re filled with beverages
maybe not accurately
but
etc
again
this might have been because we were the only people in the joint
but hey
it's something
either way
i plan to come back to explore the menu further during dinner hours
so i can maybe give a more well rounded review
haq's is a good quality indian takeaway on leith walk which offers great food and pretty fast delivery
my flatmates and i ordered a curry from here last year and it arrived speedily and at a fairly reasonable_price
we had one their menus put under our door earlier in the year and decided_to_give them a shot when none of us could be bothered cooking or walking to get a takeaway
my_only_complaint of haq's is that the phone call to order the food was about as strenuous as walking to the nearest indian probably would have been
my mate had to repeat just about every detail twice and was literally screaming our address down the phone at the guy
after this
however
the food seemed to take no time to arrive and only cost about each
including delivery
i had the chicken kathmandu which was delicious with good quality meat
but just about blew my head off it was so hot
i would recommend haq's for delivery
just practise your elocution prior to the phone call
it's been quite a while since i reviewed a take away so its a good job then that haq's was a pretty interesting subject to write about
firstly
the food here is amazing the traditional_indian cooking is splendid and i promise you
whatever you choose
you wont be dissapointed
no case of food envy here
the take away service is varied however
sometimes it is a well executed delivery and other times it is so messed up you wonder how haq's can get away with it
theres no middle ground with the take away service its either great or shocking
over all though
the quality of the food and the fact it is only around a tenner each for a banquet means i actually really rate this place highly
yum
my friend and i have ordered several different curries from here and they have all been delicious
from the super spicy to the sweet and tangy
it's all been delicious and filling
we really like the free pakoras you get on orders over and they make really great chapati
it's so rare to find such good chapati in indian_restaurants anywhere
but haq's definitely did_not_disappoint
what a great place for take away
totally_worth it
i've been here twice now
once when i first moved here and then a_few_weeks_ago
the first time i wasn't blown_away
but i can't remember why not either
since we can't find chinese to meet our needs we branched out to indian
the guy who always works the counter is lovely and they offer a student discount
which is decent
they also deliver for free locally and are very cheap
which is fantastic if you are feeling like some good indian
but low on funds
they have so many curry's to choose from and all spice_levels
the curry's are tasty and big portioned
the special rice
or non normal rice has red and green colored rice
which is weird
but i believe you can get normal white rice
they offer two meal deals
which are less then quid and you can get either veggie or meat
it is certainly an easy take away option and doesn't disappoint if you want a quick
cheap curry
not amazing
but for the price it is tasty and you can't really complain
k is a handy wee kebab house to pop into
situated in the centre of the newington area of edinburgh
k is just a short walk from the city and centre and it is very close to the university so it is incredibly convenient for the students
k specialise in indian and turkish cuisine
with dishes such as curry's and kebabs
their menu consists of tandoori indian dishes
as well as the more popular curry's such as korma and rogan_josh
k also sells the more traditional dishes too such as fish and chips
burgers
fried chicken and pizzas
i have been to k several times for dinner over the years and i have never been disappointed with my meal
their burgers are extremely well cooked and haven't got a layer of grease on them which you can sometimes find with takeaways
the chips which came with it were also very tasty
and the whole meal comes to about what a bargain
there is also a good selection of vegetarian_dishes available on k 's menu and so there is something for everyone
you are able to order online on their_website and they have a home delivery service which is incredibly convenient
k is open late so it is a great place to stop by for some food on your way home from a night out
situated on clerc street
k kebab house is ideal for students from the local halls of residence and i went there myself quite a few times during my first year
at that time they used to have a deal on called 'chicken
chips and chutney' which cost and was exactly what it claimed to be and tasted great
although horrifically spicy
i was back in about a week ago and they're no longer doing that deal
but they're still offering delicious curries
kebabs and burgers at reasonable_prices
i went for the lamb_korma with rice which cost less than and tasted great
my mate
however
ordered a pizza which came with lashings of grease which he had to mop up
other than that their food is generally good and well worth a taste
they used to have a sofa at the back of k
a bit leather one which they invited you to sit on whilst you waited for your food
then one day
i went in
and the sofa was gone
now i don't see the point
i think it's because i
and plenty of other people i know
kept going into k
ordering food then falling asleep on the sofa this was due exclusively to tiredness you understand
nothing else
i know
i know
it's a curry_house
not a bloody lounge
and
as far as the food goes
it's pretty good
fairly standard
but tasty nevertheless
they have a quite funny offer on where you get a free can of pop with a meal
but the only cans you're allowed are rolla cola and dandilion and burdock
maybe cream soda too
it's also cheap you'll not pay more than a fiver for anything
so all in all
it's a pretty good take away
but it was so much better when they had the bed
sorry
sofa
i wanted to like this place but as a delivery option
it fell short of expectations
first
it took
hours for delivery
on a non snowy edinburgh evening
second
the doner kabab w chips that i ordered was missing the chips the garlic sauce that it was to have come with
lettuce was a bit on the dried old side and only slivers of tomatoes were included in the salad
third
there was a curry_sauce in there that had more than the usual amount of oil floating to the top
i think i'd come back to give it another try
since the price is fair however
i'd avoid delivery and do take away instead
i received a leaflet under my door from taj express
and normally i just throw them away because i hate junk mail
but i hadn't had an indian for ages and the temptation got the best of me and i am so glad it did
taj express offer a wonderful
tasty curry at very respectable prices
i ordered a chicken balti
which was delicious and you get a generous serving
i also ordered naan_bread which was cooked_to_perfection
and not too greasy
unlike most indian_restaurants
what's more is that if you spend over you get free delivery which is great
the delivery time was quite long at minutes
but the quality of the food more than made up for this
this small unassuming takeaway
there is a dining space however there are no facilities
produces some tasty indian food and the portions are generous
i particularly like the tandoori_chicken biryani
the chicken in this is cooked fresh when you order
though the curries are also flavorful
if fairly standard indian fair
in the area you can't go far wrong with taj express
the food is tasty and there is plenty of it
whoever decided to open another branch of iman's just a five minute walk from my flat is my new best friend
whilst threre's no denying that newington has more curry places than it really needs
this one is definitely a keeper
usually i'm wary of places that offer too many different things to choose from on the menu
as it usually means that it's not going to be particularly fresh
but in this case
it just means i'll always be able to try something new the next time i come here or order a takeaway
so far
my current favourite is the tikka madras korma
creamy and almondy like a korma
but with some kick to it at the same time thanks to the madras
what's not to love
and at roughly
depending_on which meat you have it with
it's not going to break the bank either
next time i'll be trying their salmon punjab curry
which is marinated overnight according to the menu
my one criticism though
is that they also offer pizzas
but although this gives the impression of lacking authenticity
the curries are so good that i'll forgive them
walking into iman's you get a kind of fast foody feel to the place
everything is clean
modern and easily wipeable for a quick turnover
don't let this put you off though
the food here is excellent
iman's is primarily a curry_house but has other options if curry is not your preferred meal of choice
they do a good range of pizzas
about
for a
and
for a
especially the meat bonanza
also the grill serves some great meat
with steaks
chops
kebabs and indian dishes all on offer
the indian food is great
they have a huge selection of starters
mains and sides
the menu can be a bit intimidating at first as there is so much food but it is all spread out into easily readable sections
the srarters are reasonably_priced
and surprisingly filling
with my favourite being the ginger and cinnamon king prawns
the first time i came here i had the chicken reshmi kebab which was refreshingly not dried_out and well spiced
the second time i opted for a curry and went for one of the specialities
which i would definitely recommend
the chilli garlic
was really hot but brilliantly flavoured
definitely one of the better curries i've had in edinburgh
the service was friendly
all the staff seem very keen to accommodate you
but there seems to be a certain element of in and out going on
the place is great
but sometimes just seems a little bit too fast foody for my liking
but don't let this put you off
the food is really good and if you live around newington definitely pop in
there's not a whole lot to say about imans
they don't know how to use an apostrophe
i can say that much
it's a great big new curry_house in newington whose full title is actually 'imans grill a taste of punjab'
inside it's fairly tastefully decked out
the tables and chairs are a nice
understated dark wood
there's nothing crazy going out
it's the outside that gets me
the sign is an enormous what looks like leopard print
and it's got big banners everywhere
just has the look and feel of a tacky place
onto the food
then
the selection here is enormous
they've all different_types_of curries to cater to all tastes
they even have a british section
why the hell would you go to a curry_house for an omelette
who does that
anyway
the curry i had
lamb saag
was ok
not terrible
but not mind blowing
just ok
i reckon this place would be great to take a huge group to
it's bigger than the batcave
i've been to the one in bruntsfield as well as on nicholson street
and both have been excellent
definitely a step up from other indian_restaurants
and the decor and atmosphere is inviting in addition to friendly_staff
i've had chicken_tikka biryani
a specialty punjabi dish
can't remember_the_name
as well as tasted others' meals and everything has been great
also
it's byob which cuts down on the price of the bill and is a fun time to get together with friends
i'd recommend_this_place_to_anyone
although i've been told it's not authentic
i've never been to india so i don't know what is
but it tastes good to me
this is a brilliant restaurant that has only recently opened in edinburgh's new town
the food is some of the best indian food i have tasted
the d_cor is very nice and there are photos of india scattered around and every table has a small bunch of flowers on it
the prices are a bit higher_than the average
but it is definitely worth it as the quality of the food is so good
fortunately it was my parents who footed the bill
we started by ordering a couple of papadums each
which were very crispy and they came with a large selection of sauces to complement them
i also got a large bottle of kingfishers beer for
for the main_course i had my favourite curry chicken rogan_josh
and the chicken was lovely and tender and the sauce was full_of_flavour
we also order naans for the meal and they weren't greasy at all
which you find in many other restaurants
my dad is a curry veteran and has at least one a week and even he was full of praise for the spice pavilion
i am already looking_forward to returning soon
i hail from the midlands which has some great curry_houses
so i'm always a little apprehensive when dining in curry places elsewhere
but a quick google search found the spice pavilion and i thought it was worth a try
i believe the style is kashmiri
and the food was really excellent
we ate garlic chicken
kathmandu murgh
with lentils and garlic
and a saag aloo
the saag aloo was the star dish
but all three were truly excellent
the service was fine
although i was a little unsure about the way food is served from a trolley
but otherwise fine
the ambience was relaxed and children appeared_to_be welcome in the early evening
i wouldn't hesitate to return next time i'm in edinburgh
in the words of david k
'npwh
nice people work here
'
the friendly
pleasant matron of the house came and chatted with us after we stuffed our faces full of delightful indian_cuisine
it turns_out that she's italian
which led to our earlier confusion about why some white lady was running an indian restaurant
but her husband
and chef
is indian
mystery solved
at any rate
this is legit grub
it may be pricey
especially compared to the offerings one can find on manchester's curry mile
but for being in edinburgh
the ability to score real south_asian eats is a pleasant surprise
if you're into spicy food be sure to give the vindaloo a try
the boy likes it hot
and spice pavilion's version certainly had my nose beading up with sweat
also lending to the traditional british indian restaurant offerings
you'll find cobra on draught
be sure to have a pint or two on hand if you're choosing menu offerings heavy on the capsaicin
i guarantee you'll want a sip of something cold at hand to douse your tongue
considering the extensive selection of veg and non_veg courses featured in the densely packed tome of a menu
it appears that i'll have plenty more to try upon future returns
needless_to_say
i'm looking_forward to the opportunity
the place is headed very near george street in new town
we shared a couple of dishes and everything was great
all the stuff was also attentive
the women who was in charge of the place
probably the owner
did a great job also
she really made_us_feel welcome
my only concern is the decor
like some other places in edinburgh its very simple decorated
clean with white walls
i think though this place could add a little more cozy touch
darker walls and soft lightning
spice pavilion is a smart new town indian
where we received one of the warmest welcomes in the city
seriously
the service was absolute gold
and the food wasn't far behind that standard
either
well worth a visit
overall
we said
i really enjoyed the whole restaurant experience in the spice pavilion
the service was just great
put you right at your ease
and allowed you to relax and enjoy your lunch at your leisure
in the smart surroundings
it was prompt and accurate
as well as being overwhelmingly welcoming
the food is fresh and flavour packed
too
thereby ensuring that every aspect of our time in the place was a complete pleasure
went here for dinner on new years day
and even though they seemed very busy we were seated_right_away without a reservation
we tried the pompadon which came with a great chutney tray
and a truly excellent saag_paneer
the entrees
briyani
and chicken_tika_masala
were tasty
came in good portions
and were well cooked overall a bit better than average
service_was_a_bit_slow
but not truly bad untill we asked for the check
our waiter started asking if we enjoyed the hogmany fireworks the previous evening
which we had
then proceeded to rant about how it was a waste of money that should go to starving children worldwide
the rest of the process was filled with huffing and dirty looks
i'm not insensitive to these problems
but getting lectured while i'm paying the bill really ruined an otherwise great evening with very good food
excellent service and food to match
and this coming from some big indian food fans from ireland
would_definitely_recommend_this_place
particularly the tandoori sharing starter
even the pilau_rice was delicious
kebabish original is a brand of restaurants that now scale the country a vast menu that includes kebabs
curries
burgers
salads and mixed grills
this means that however fussy one of your mates are
they are sure to find something that tickles their fancy
from the outside kebabish original looks really trendy and modern with huge panel windows and inside this theme is continued and offers a really cool
trendy place to dine
i came here with a few friends after a game of laser quest
which is just down the road and i ordered a kebab
as i thought this would be the safest bet as the name of the restaurant suggests this is their speciality
i was right and the kebab tasted fantastic
and there is no comparison between the greasy kebabs i have become used to from cheap takeaways to this well seasoned one
my friends weren't as complimentary about the food however
saying that their curries tasted greasy
so i would therefore say that if you do come here
that you go for the kebabs
having chomped down on various shish
doner and chicken_tikka rolls from various kebabish outlets over the years
i have to concur with el tel's viewpoint that this place is excellent
as long as you stick to the kebabs
and what kebabs they are
stuck on a charcoal grill often right in front of you
the proper barbeque taste is nothing short of fantastic
the salad is fresh
and if you avoid the doner
a few of the grilled varieties probably aren't all that bad for your health either
having only tried a curry once
it wasn't at the same level
but the kebabs are what it's all about
what they want you to experience
so grumbling about that would be like going to pizza hut and complaining that the pasta is shite
which it is
fantastic for kebabs
and with their rapid expansion
a testament to good old free market economics
it's funny how a place can get some things so right and others totally wrong
i once had a big argument with a friend about how a chicken kebab isn't actually that unhealthy grilled chicken on a pitta bread
with salad
yeah but what about the garlic mayo and chilli sauce
well yeah
but mcdonald's don't put burger sauce on their calorie count
do they
wallace
anyway
the kebabs in this place are excellent
beautifully seasoned and genuinely tasty
and cooked on a charcoal grill
the salad is actually pretty good too
not just the usual chopped red cabbage
why do kebab shops think this is ok
that said
the curries are no where near as good
my friend had a bhuna
obviously
we're northern
and it had about half an inch of grease laminating the top
the actual curry tasted fine
but he had a slippery face afterwards
go for the kebabs
nothing else
what's this
yet another review of something within spitting distance of your house chris
quelle surprise
get over it
it's happening
sure enough
kebabish is situated not two minutes from my house on dalry road
and if i wasn't spoiled enough already with the likes of chop chop and sushiya a mere stone's throw away
amongst many other fine places
there's now another place to add to the list
that's right
kebabish was surprisingly top_notch
we were met
seated and made our order with no fuss or bother and the food arrived pretty quickly too
fun times
so the food itself
my bud had the chicken_wings for starters
they were amongst the finest chicken_wings i've ever had in a restaurant
fact
i went for the quail
more for the novelty than anything
and for those who've not had quail
meh
it's alright i guess
this is purely down to a consequence of the meat itself and not the cooking or presentation of it it was cooked well and has quite a satisfying meaty taste
there's just not much of it
i would have much rather had the wings
for mains we both went for karahis
i got the chicken and he got the lamb
mine was better
for the uninitiated
a karahi is a cooking pot which is used in the preparation of the dish just so you know
educational reviews
the dishes themselves were mightily tasty with a nice mix of spice and flavour not bland and hot like many other curries
really quite delicate whilst potent
oh hello ginger
thanks for that flavour explosion in my mouth
i love ginger
accompaniments in the form of rice and naan were satisfying but somewhat short of being noteworthy
and hey
how could we not at least give mention to byob with no corkage
simply brilliant
the fly in the ointment and the reason for four stars in place of five
well firstly the lamb in the karahi was a little tough and
although still quite tasty
hadn't been cooked anywhere long enough to let it come close to being as good as the chicken
secondly
for two popadoms and dips
i even went and checked online to make sure we hadn't been jipped and true enough there it is plain as day
as someone who has frequented curry_houses since youth i have never in my days seen that kind of disproportionate pricing
but hey
don't buy the pops and you're in for a treat
have been a few times
serivce good
staff friendly and nice_atmosphere
food has been mostly good but a couple of duff dishes
the overcooked prawn in particular
i'd still recommend it though even with the ocassional mistake
kebabish is the uk's biggest chain of asian restaurants
their dishes from the grill are first class
i didn't care much for the place
though
and the service was down right poor
overall
we said
the food that i had at kebabish was extremely good
the service and setting don't match it
at all
the frowner in chief should turn his attention away from glowering at his chefs and glower at his serving staff
instead
if that dead eye stare has the same effect on them as is does on the kitchen staff
he'll address the place's real weaknesses
in no time
we decided to visit kebabish after a bunch of guys from my office had a team night and mentioned it as a bit of a meat fest
wow
the first thing is the smell grilling meats
mmmmmmm
from its quite trendy decor to the very attentive staff it was super all round
i had the sheek kebab to start large
flavoursome and piping_hot pieces of yumminess
and husband had malai boti chicken which was a lot of meat for a starter
our waiter was very knowledgeable
as i had queried what was the hotter of two main_dishes
and he suggested i order the north_indian chilli garlic lamb with great flavours but get it vindaloo hot
husband had lamb jhalfrezi which was succulent and rich he mentioned how tender the meat was
there's a mixed_grill which sounds amazing
the boys at work had it
which is a huge pot of chops
steaks and other carnivorous delights
even better
it's a byo with a co op next_door so three bottles of san miguel for was all we splashed for drinks
service was brisk but not rushed and you see the chefs behind glass
highly_recommended hence
after hearing quite a bit about this place we finally decided to check it out
it turns_out it's a great establishment
you can't find such an array of grilled foods under one roof in edinburgh as this place
the food is rather spicy but it compliments the meat nicely
also the prices_are_very_reasonable
i recommend it
damn
this place was amazing
the mixed_grill was so good i almost cried
the chicken_wings were the best chicken_wings i have ever had ever
then i ordered lamb_vindaloo and it was so tasty and so frigin spicy i actually did cry
well done
why is there no good indian in america
after passing by ko a gazillion times
finally had dinner at the place for a friend's farewell
watching from the outside its brightly lit restaurant
we usually find it packed with people
we must have decided to drop in on an unusually quiet day
service is slow
which is disappointing
we had naan and tandoori_chicken
pretty decent
as poor scholars
we thought the price was slightly out of a student's budget but overall
the portions was quite sizable
well priced with a decent range of dishes
pretty swift service
the restaurant is a bit draughty though
as noted by earlier reviewers
could also do with having the extractor fan in the gents fitted back into the plasterboard
a good place to go with a group of mates though so i'd be happy to make a return_visit
oh dear
had a really poor meal here
will never be back
the service was beyond poor and it took an_hour for the food to arrive
when it finally came it was just fine nothing_to_write_home_about and i was completely underwhelmed
at one point we asked a waitress how much longer it would be for food
no joke
she shrugged her shoulders and said
i don't know
and that was it
she didn't apologise
check with the kitchen
ask us if we wanted another drink
anything
i burst out laughing at her behaviour and the guys on the table next to us started a chat about how long they'd been waiting too
haha
was given a hokey excuse about the restaurant being understaffed at the end of the meal
after we tried to pay and had to wait another ten_minutes
but honestly the food was expensive for what it was and experience very poor
why bother going back again when so many other fantastic indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
fail
kebabish
fail
i have only collected take away food from this restaurant so i can't comment on the serving experience
it's true that every few months i see new faces
assistant waitresses mainly
but the indian pakistani guys seem regular to me
it's considered a busy place
very spacious and the customers' origins vary
now
about the take away food
i've tried all their biryani dishes and they're mouth_watering
if you live close by
it's better to grab the food and go home to enjoy it
as the price difference is considerable
for example lamb_biryani and peshwari_naan bread for
a friend_of_mine tried a spicy lamb dish and he loved it
he's a curry expert with his friends trying different restaurant almost per month for years in edinburgh
their paratha bread is also great lighter in the stomach compared to the naan_bread
it's easy to give them a call and order the food
what i found unexpected is that you will get text promotions on your mobile phone every two months or so and there's no obvious option to unsubscribe
i never opted in
so they seem to take it for granted when you make a phone order
i do believe though if you give them a call they should be able to remove you from the list
their punctuality is not the best when ordering take away
they don't check always how busy is the kitchen
and they mention fixed time mins or so
but if you show up earlier
your order might be ready
oh
and they accept card payments for less than without any extra charge
looking_forward to trying more dishes and the thrill of the grill
i really love the food here there are loads of veggie_options and they all taste great
if i order an indian takeaway i always call here
i've also been to 'eat in' several times over the last couple of years
only drawback is that it's usually very quiet
i guess it's just that bit further out of the centre of town
just past haymarket
than some folk want to travel
shame as the food is just fab
food quality and flavour
stars
service and environment stars
so what's the average
i'll be generous
stars
here it goes
i remember a friend_of_mine trying out this restaurant with vouchers and highly_recommended it
so i decided to try it out with another friend who has the taste card
two for one
he called them quite a few times on the phone but there was no reply
it was a surprise looking at their_website
not updated since
really
on the plus side their glorious menu is available at just eat
so you can certainly be interested from there
no
there is no direct link for their_website to just eat
i saw a gentleman going out with bags for delivery
and i think some people came in for take away
there we go
friday_evening after work
it's raining cats and dogs and we arrive at the restaurant
you can have a look at one of the yelp pics
the titles on the windows look so old to me
the waiter is friendly
letting us choose a table far from the door and he brings us the menus immediately
as we review the very detailed menu
i notice an ant walking on the salt jar
i start making mental notes about my yelp review
my friend was more relaxed and removed the ant
and told me not to be harsh
well
an_hour later
we saw another ant walking on the wall behind my friend
we ordered the food
ceylon lamb and vegetarian malayan
both having coconut
with the second one being sweet as it includes pineapple
we were both so pleased and delighted with the food
forcing ourselves to eat it slowly to enjoy more along with a tasty garlic_naan bread
our mixed pakora was also of great quality with a special sweet and hot_sauce that made the difference
my friend who has tried lots of indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh found it astounding
however it was another gentleman now serving us
who has been in that restaurant for less than a year
as he told us
and we started noticing his difficulties waiting for the other tables
there were big delays for some of them from the time they ordered till they got the starters
a couple must have been waiting for at least mins
the guy hadn't manage to take their order yet
and they decided to go
my advice
if you're a big curry fan
you need to try it
if you value more the service than the food
you might want to think again
personally
i'm planning going back to try more
i've only had takeaway from here but it is utterly lovely
the meal deal options are really very good value and you often get extras put in which is nice
delivery is timely and service over the phone is good
the tikka and passanda are particularly good
my son and girlfriend went to this restaurant tonight
they are not registered users of yelp and asked me to put in a good word for the mumbai
they had the pasanda and the lamb rezala
they said both were excellent
i enjoyed my visit here
i placed my trust in the helpful waiter to choose what i ate
and was rewarded with two tasty courses
i'm not sure the place is capable of outstanding culinary fireworks
but it terms of reliable
fresh indian dishes
i was very happy with the place
overall
we said
i was really pleased with mumbai mansion
i feel that i could go there again
put my trust in the waiter's choices
and be served some more good dishes
if you're in the neighbourhood
i'd certainly say to you that it's worth stopping in to sample some of their high_quality dishes
a nice saturday lunch with my husband to mumbai mansion
we are here fairly frequently and this time it is with a
living_social
discount voucher
i like the veggie non spicy options they have on the menu but i was a bit disappointed that they could not accommodate my request to add paneer indian cheese with my vegetable_korma
even though i advised i was happy to pay the difference in cost
the staff are attentive and the food is very prompt and tasty
the restaurant is spotlessly clean and well presented
a nice_touch is the place mats that are done as the calcutta new paper and you can sit and read their news articles which are humerus
a great local indian restaurant which i will be back to soon no doubt
the prince balti is out the way for me but it's worth_the_drive
the food and staff are great and it's a reasonably_priced night out if you want to sit it
they do deliver and once they've got your address you will always get a christmas card
their nan breads are huge
so take care
this is a fantastic restaurant and as long as you are not eating on your own
the prices will be very reasonable too
from sunday thursday
if you eat in the restaurant
they have a great offer where you can get a free meal basically
if you order one starter
you get the second free and this applies for mains and desserts too
when me and my friend came here
it actually worked out to be one of the cheapest curries that we have actually had when we divided the cost between us
in terms of the quality of the food
it hits all the right notes too and i found that the papadams were light and crispy and the chicken rogan_josh that i ordered was full_of_flavour
with a good serving of sauce to compliment the tender chicken
the drink prices were however
a bit steep
my friend paying
for a can of coke
but i only have water with my curry so i didn't have fork this out fortunately
i will definitely be coming_back and making use of this great offer soon
nom nom nom
i haven't eaten in this restaurant since my heady days working the fringe oh cough cough years_ago
this is the restaurant where i discovered chicken korai
a staple in my menu
and where memories and lasting friendships were fostered
last_night after a few cheeky beers along the promenade
i
with friends
retraced my steps to the prince and tucked into another exemplary meal
vegetable korai works almost as well as chicken korai
onion bhajis
naan
lemon_rice
all tasted delicious and i rolled out with a bulbous belly
feeling all was right with the world
may your ascendancy to the throne long continue
prince
this was my second visit after impressed the first time
not disappointed
nice
simple decor where food really stands_out
fairly reasonable_price
bindi gosht was excellent
this is currently my favourite indian
well worth a visit
this place is great
i'm not a local i was in edinburgh on holiday
i am a curry enthusiast though and i've eaten in on three separate continents
i decided that i would do a curry tour of edinburgh choose a different indian_joint every night and try to find the best cross between most flavorful and spiciest_curry in the city
what attracted me to this place was the advertisement that they serve the hottest curry available something that puts even a vindaloo to shame
so i headed out to portobello to check it out
the atmosphere was very comfortable and inviting and the waitstaff extremely friendly
i got in and fund the prices decent enough
which is a perk
and ordered my mixed_vegetable fal
extra_spicy
as in more than it already is
with rice and chapati
the waiter asked several times if i knew what i was getting into
and then suggested i get a beer to go along with it
well
why not
so i did
the food came out and it was very aesthetically pleasing
not to mention that invigorating aroma
i went ahead and tried it and wow it was really flavorful
but it wasn't really that spicy
you must understand that i eat spicy food well beyond that of most human beings
i eat foods that i've watched others cry to taste
i'm not being egotistical
i'm just being honest i like to get indian take away back home and add habaneros and ghost pepper hot_sauce to it before i eat it
so
i sent the fal back to make it even spicier
it still could've been spicier
in my book
but it was vastly improved and so i decided not to be a pain
it was delicious as any meal could ever be and i'll look back on this meal fondly for a long time
finally
my peeps have made it to las_vegas
rani's world foods is an indian grocery_store chaat stand that can hold it's own against the mega stores in california and texas
this store has an amazing array of indian groceries
frozen foods
produce and to kick it up a notch
they even offer chaat
indian snacks
that are served up in their in house kitchen
we had gone for their opening today and it was a zoo
way too many people and the lines to check out were minutes long
but
i had to oppurtunity to peruse their aisles and these_guys have everything an indian cook home may need or want
pickles
multiple lentil varieties
exotic indian vegetables
flour
spices
everything was perfectly laid_out and easy_to_find
this store is definitely bigger than any other indian store in las_vegas
it's well lit
well organized and well_stocked
the trifecta
bonus points to them for their frozen food selections which were not unnecessarily marked up in price something that the other indian grocery stores seem to be doing that i frown upon
gopal's for example
crosses out the manufacturer's suggested price sticker and charges a dollar or two more
these_guys don't
at least not yet
i haven't had a chance to taste their chaat offerings as today was free food for all and so the lines were out of control
i hope to have a follow up report some time soon
an indian store in las_vegas that rivals wal mart
wow
never thought i'd live to see this day
this was a little tricky to find
as i visited at night and their sign was not lit up
even during the day
i pass this all the time and have never seen it it was only by the good grace of yelp that i heard of rani's at all
this is a very clean
spacious and modern indian market
they are well_stocked with all of the usual things
spices
pulses
frozen foods
pickles
biscuits
etc
their produce section is inviting and well laid_out with those little water sprayers above that keep the vegetables fresh
there's also a deli counter with hot snacks and sweets
attended by very sweet ladies who also prepare all the foods
the veg pakoras were really nice
also the besan ka ladoo
a subtle sweet flavored by cashew
so yummy
finally
it was satisfying to see the modern cash_register with its big screen where you can keep tabs on all of the prices as they ring up
it irks me in other small markets where you just kind of have to trust the cashier to not make mistakes
a big thank you to my fellow yelpers for helping me find this great place
the place is clean and very organized and it was nice to be able to find everything we needed easily
they also have serve food
different_types_of chaat and other snacks as well as mithai
the lady running the food section is extremely sweet and welcoming
we went to order bhel_puri and she offered us pakoras from a fresh hot batch she had just fried
i should never go to the grocery_store when hungry cause i ended_up also ordering a samosa chat
the portions are huge and i was full after eating some of the bhel
also
they have free tea which is great
i was also impressed with their customer orientation
the guy at the cash_register mentioned alternatives to some stuff we had bought
he even replaced a cauliflower we had chosen stating that it didn't look very good
i will definitely go again even though its a distance from home
first off
read my review for new india market
which is in the next complex over
now come back to rani's world foods
yeah
the difference is ridiculous
this store is much larger
cleaner
the staff is much nicer
the selection of products is better
most_importantly
the pricing is always consistent
the prices don't constantly change
and almost everything is clearly marked with a price tag
the price isn't up to the person at the cash_register at that very moment
everyone pays the same price
also
they have fresh food as well
and it is amazing
plenty of shopping carts
so you can load up on all your indian groceries
produce and whatnots
you'll be on your merry way in no time at all
great selection of indian prayer items
teas
spices
pots
pans and the like
also
if you like marmite
vegemite or any of that stuff
you can get it here
hop to it
what is a better way to shop than drinking free tea
don't sit here and read my review
do yourself the favor of jumping in the car and going over there to see what it's all about
the people that run the store
sorry i forgot the guys name
and the mom grandmom esk indian woman in the back cooking samosas just totally embody what we are all looking for when we walk into a place for the first time
try this
taste that
have a cup of tea dear
bring your friends
bring your family
grab a cart and go on an excursion
take your time
this place is sweet and so are the people running it
my knowledge of indian foods is unfortunatly minimal
i have to confess
but
i've been wanting to learn more
getting a few cookbooks and familiar with things i want to try
a total novice
but with rani's world foods
i'm well on my way to being an expert
yes
this place is clean
bright
inviting and omg
when you walk into the front doors
the intoxicating smell of exotic spices and deliciousness just hit you like a brick wall
i was in love
the spice selection totally floored me
i mean
i'd only read about asfodita
and now i know where to buy it
i want to be a bit different than all the other glowing posts rani's has here
all about the food
which is wonderful
but
all about the really unique hair products
i never knew there was such a thing as jasmine hair oil
untill seeing the vast selection at rani's
these oils are mainly coconut based
with jasmine extract for gorgeous fragrance
some will have other natural ingredients for added benefits
i picked out
one was specifically for color treated hair like i possess
after using my blow dryer to style my hair
i use a small amount of this in my palm
and glide it down the hair shaft
the results are fantastic
with the best part is it's not greasy
i was expecting my hair to look limp and nasty as the day went on
but it stays soft and shiny all day
plus
it's very inexpensive to boot
the small bottle
the large bottle
for color treated hair
i'm sold on this stuff
we recently fell into an affair with indian food
if they cook it
we have will eaten eat there
it led to a search of cookbooks with many spices i had no clue where to find locally
a little search on yelp popped up this little gem that meets both my eating and cooking wants
the bf and i ate at the food booth in the back and shared a vegetarian thali
comes with dishes among several choices
dal
rice
pickles
bread
samosa chat
i believe
and a paneer stuffed paratha w yogurt
it was plenty of food for two and all very nice
i am a big_fan of the samosa chat here though
the chutneys were fresh and vibrant and kept me going for more
there is a water cooler and a hot tea dispenser that is complimentary but there is also various drinks in the fridge area
if you're in the area and want a tasty snack or a nice veggie meal
definitely drop in
grocery side has everything we were looking for
they have also some more common spices that i decided to get here as the prices are really good
for example
i almost bought a jar of cinnamon sticks at the grocery and it's
for the same amount here
a nice sized jar of spices start are mostly about
with the harder to find spices like green cardamom pods are around
very few are over that
for those who need spices in mass quantities
they have huge value bags as well and they seem to be a better deal than buying at sams costco
i also hoped i can find some fresh herbs and they indeed had fresh curry leaves and fresh fenugreek
if you're not into the cooking stuff
there are plenty of tasty and interesting looking snacks and prepared packs of food
we bought a few heat and eat packets and some were good and some not
i suppose it's hit and miss
but hey
it's packet food and isn't anything like the fresh
eat
cook and be merry
my husband and i drove by rani's a couple weeks_ago and he said
international market
that looks interesting
so i made a note to check it out on yelp later
after reading the reviews i channeled liz lemon and exclaimed
vegetarian indian food
i want to go to there
so that is how we wound up at rani's
i immediately went to the counter and ordered a thali and paneer paratha
i'm a sucker for paneer
and the cute lil lady behind_the_counter proceeded to give me an indian sweet to have while i waited
she brought out our thali
which consisted of roti
rice
dal
pickles
okra
an aloo_gobi type yumminess
and i believe kofta
veggie dumplings
the cute lil lady was feeling generous and also gave_us a tomato_soup with paneer in it
definite bonus points
everything was fantastic
although i was expecting a little more paneer flavor to my paratha
this place is very casual
which i really like about it
don't come in expecting the same food that you would get at a sit_down indian restaurant
instead
expect the kind of food you would get if you were invited to a grandma's kitchen
after we filled our bellies
we wandered through the aisles of the immaculately clean grocery_store
i hadn't planned on buying anything
but when i found garam masala for super cheap
and black salt that i had been looking for everywhere and couldn't find
and a giant bag of arrowroot powder for a couple bucks
normally for a tiny jar anywhere_else
well you get the picture
anything you would need for a well_stocked indian pantry is here
and then some
there's also mint and tamarind sauces
bottled lassis
naan
and huge blocks of paneer
trust_me when i say i seriously considered buying all the above to snack on at home
i considered giving this place stars
because we went back a couple days later and the food was cold and missing that extra special love like we had the first time
but it was a friday_evening and there was an indian soap opera on the tv i think we interrupted
so
obviously
i can't blame them
the store
stumbled onto this place while i was in vegas for a month
has a great selection of indian spices
groceries et al
name it and i think they have it
was very very impressed with their well maintained space and selection
the cafe
aaah
don't you miss the parathas
great aloo and gobi parathas
i am a fan
the lady behind_the_counter here
very warm and welcoming
very reminiscent of grandma
will tell you all that's laid_out is home made and lovingly made
it sure does taste good
don't forget to wrap up a selection of sweets
the kala jamun is yummmm
the pickles are great too
don't let the unassuming outer appearance fool you
it is a great place to stumble upon
love the food and service
one of the cleaner indian grocery shops i've been to
clean deli
the food in their deli is excellent
you can taste the freshness
even the chana
chickpeas
are fresh and not canned
and on top of it they have a great selection of indian and british groceries
wow
i read_the_reviews and decided to check it out
this place is so cool
amazing selection of indian goods
especially sauce mixes
the food counter
omg
tried the paneer and the basmati_rice
the rice was better than a number of the sit_down indian_restaurants i've been to and the paneer had a great texture and flavor
the price was way better too
the little cart of kulfi was also wonderful
a complete meal for half of what i would pay at a regular restaurant
yay
food counter review
thali price alert
thali price alert
the thali is no longer
it is
there has been a increase
so i told my whole team that it was only
for a plate of vegetarian ethnic yumminess
based_on the yelp_reviews
when we arrived
i noticed that the where it was supposed_to_be
it was covered with a piece of paper with
written on it
boo
i gave false information to my whole team
nonetheless
we all had thali
the sweet little lady took precious time
a bit slow for our liking since we had to get back to work
to prepare each tray with whatever she want to put on it
my tray consisted of the following
mashed spinach
doesn't look appetizing
but tasted ok
i only ate a few bites of this
eggplant curry
was delicious and tasty
i finished this
squash something
i finished this too
it was very refreshing
tofu something
was decent
but not as flavorful
there were three cubes of tofu in this compartment
basmati_rice with peas the rice taste good
purple onion slices with spicy mango sauce
this was supposed_to_be the pickle veg on the menu
well
it doesn't really taste like it would sound
we all thought the sauce tasted like pinesol
we didn't touch this on our tray
roti
tasted like tortilla
i should have asked for paratha
the milk tea and purified water was complimentary
i give this a star
grocery_store review
my co_worker picked_up a bag of naan and a bottle of lychee drink from the grocery side
when she was about to pay for it and flipped over the bag of naan
those visible naans were moldy blue in color
the guy that was about to ring it up took it and throw it away
people
make sure you inspect the goods before making a purchase
sometimes
we tend to not look at it until we are about to enjoy the food
i give this a star
overall
star place
decided to go for lunch at rani's after reading all the five_star reviews at yelp
the food was great
as good as home_cooked indian food
great customer_service
i've been eying this place for a while
since i don't live too far from here
the rainbow on the sign always catches my eye when i drive by because i love rainbows
i situated in a corner in a strip_mall
this store looks smallish from the outside
when i walked in i was genuinely surprised
this place is a legit grocery_store
they even have a fresh produce section
which i really wasn't expecting
i came here looking for some garam masala for the chicken_makhani dish a pakistani friend_of_mine said i must cook
i couldn't find this spice at my normal haunts
so upon recommendation from the guys at trader joes i went to rani's
i found a plethora of ethnic spices
and the garam masala was easy to locate
i even got some pineapple jam
which i'm excited about trying
the customer_service wasn't all too friendly
and when i paid for my items
the lady intentionally did not give me the coin part of my change
perhaps that was her tip
ok
so it was only a few pennies
but it really tripped me out the way she didn't even attempt to give me the change
she only handed me the dollars and then walked away
well ok
ms
thang
anyway
if you're searching for hard_to_find ethnic spices from all over the world
then i recommend coming here
maybe i'll come back and try the lunch counter next time
you're now reading a review of rani's by the duke of rani's
yes
the long road to dukedom was finally achieved today with my
nd check in
how did y'all let this happen
okay maybe not everyone_else is glued to their iphone as much as i am to try to check in as often
but still
first and nd visit i got the thali
both times the service was extremely pleasant
though this nd time the woman working the counter sort of forgot about my order and served the next party first
wasn't too big of a deal and she seemed apologetic
i love the ordering checkout process
as both times it evolved into some sort of old school bartering system
always in my favor
me
i'll take a smart water too
grabs
bottle from the fridge
her
just give me a dollar
deal
almost convinced that if i wandered in there with nothing but cents to my name
i'd somehow walk out with a full stomach
don't try this kids
onto the food
i have no_idea_what the proper names are of what i ate either time
the first time i just waited for the woman
rani
to make my plate
and then i devoured most of it
didn't care for the onions as i noticed someone else mention
and i also had some cold chickpea dish that day that wasnt appeasing to me
everything else
rice
dal
roti
some tofu thing
was delicious
this time another woman
not rani
actually showed me all the different options for the thali
i heard her mention buttermilk and cheese in a few of them so i simply requested that i not have anything with milk or cheese and she happily obliged
i ended_up with a dish with chickpeas
one with red beans
an eggplant one
the rice
and those onions
grrrrr
and some sort of hot pickle pepper thing
loved it all except the onions
now go beat me for this duke title
i don't deserve it with only visits
i had rani's bookmarked forever
and i finally made it down here to actually do some grocery shopping
well
my mom did some grocery shopping
i kinda fail at the learning to cook my ethnic food
but enough of that
i went and met rani and she's awesome
she reminds me basically of every_single indian grandma
they stuff you full of food to show their affection
my only qualm is that the food isn't next level spicy
when i want to eat chaat
i wanna feel like my intestinal lining is being seared off
but hey
i know she's catering to both indian and non indian palates
so i'll let it slide
but this is a great place to come when i'm missing some homemade food
great vegetarian food with excellent spices
this is owned by a local family
very polite and friendly place
by no means will rani be the first place i think of for indian_cuisine
the plates have a decent variety_of_dishes
but nothing spectacular
today's thali platter consisted of a saag
lentils
and a paneer dish with onions
rice
and pickles
i enjoyed the saag because of the hints of ginger
but the other items were mediocre
i ended_up dabbing my bread off with napkins before bites due to how much oil was on them
everything else was forgettable though
the vegetable_samosas were delicious
they were predominantly potatoes with peas
the chutneys were refreshing and flavorful
dipping these golden pockets in the sauce made for good eats
the mango_lassi was the other highlight of the meal
it was not too sweet and had a robust taste ripe mangoes
this place is great
i didn't realize there was a food stand inside
but glad i found out
this is right next to zia records and they sell all types of indian spices you usually can't find anywhere_else
the lady behind the food counter is very nice and after visit they recognized me and even knew what i liked to eat
the food is all made fresh and has the home feel taste to it
this place is better than most restaurants out there and much cheaper too
we bought a large sized portion of the beans and it lasted for days
they also provide free tea which usually cost in restaurants
the good thing is it's very close to mt
everest
our favorite indian restaurant
if you wanted to eat out
good
friendly service
loved it this is one of the nicest indian markets i have been to
i will be shopping here regularly
there are even size choices on bags of flour and rice
back home there was only one size
clean and bright
fresh mehindi is in the fridge here as well
third time
for the
thali to go
also ordered veggie_samosas
guess what
no onions this time
one of the best indian meals i've ever had
no joke
all from the comfort of my office and for or so with the samosas and a giant bottle of smart water
seemed like i got a lot more food when getting it to go as well
interesting development
seriously i'm blown_away right now
huge heapings of dal
curries
and veggies and a gigantic portion of rice for
the stretch of sahara between samosa_factory
rani's and mt_everest is all i need in my life
homey feel so tasty home style food
which is good on stomach
since it's homey style
if you go later in the night
they will just reheat and serve
had tried the food times in our recent trip_to_vegas
dhahi vadai is not thayir vadai
it was terrible
keep doing north_indian foods only
south_indian is not your strength
if you want a good thayir vadai
fly to sfo
there are plenty of south_indian food here
other than that their paratha's and thali are good
bhel is also good
old lady is like your grandma
mostly a nice lady
but speaks one indian language only
so if you dont speak that language
you are at mercy with her english
we had an altercation with her
because she couldn't understand our english
though
it got cleared
she was still upset and started being erratic to us
so we were little upset
i could have gone there again
but one of our friend referred india_masala in rivera
which was convenient and good
stars because every time i come in here to satisfy my gulab_jamun craving
the owners are extremely friendly
i like to buy my chutneys and lentils here
as well as some frozen veggies
but the one thing i am never without from this place are the fresh roasted peanuts in their produce section
i don't know what makes them so addicting
but you really must try them
omg
everyone i offer them to wants to know where i buy them
i'm not a fan of their hot food section
maybe it was because the one time i tried it
it was near closing and everything just seemed old and dried_out
plus
it looked a bit dirty
maybe i will try again when things are fresher earlier in the day
but this is a fun place to discover new spices and sauces
if you have ever been to india's sweets and spices in southern california
then you will feel right at home here
this is a terrific indian market that also includes fresh produce for sale
it is the one place in town where i know i can find real fresh bitter melon
they also have a wonderful restaurant in the store where if you don't know what it is you can simply point to what loks good to you
as far as raw goes not much in that arena in indian cooking
but if you are okay with traditional_indian vegetarian fare this is the spot for it in las_vegas
they always offer free chai_tea and the woman chef who runs the place could not have been nicer
what a great smile
and you know
that smile gets translated into the food
love rani's
the reason for the trip to rani's was that a friend who lived nearby was looking for some special seasonings for a special dish to prepare
i decided i wouldn't mind going on a field trip and possibly discover some treats that were new to me
neither one of us had lunch yet and were delighted to find that they had a little restaurant inside
yay
a in
seeing that it was a new store to the both of us and how we love to peruse international markets for hidden gems we combed the place
no aisle was overlooked
no shelf was neglected
we searched high and low for any and everything
he found the spices that he was looking for
the shelves were well_stocked and the place was nice and clean
the place is obviously cared for in that respect
i did notice that things were higher priced here compared to what i have seen in other international markets around town
that was a bit of a disappointment
by the time we were all set to purchase there was no one at the cash_register
we looked around and only saw other customers doing their shopping
we saw the bell by the register area and rang it once
the cashier came quickly and rang us up
she didn't greet
she didn't say anything actually
she just held out her hand for the money and practically threw the change at my friend
i thought it was quite rude
we tried to ignore it as we were plenty hungry by this time and wanted to get down to the grub
we made our way to the
restaurant
area
there was already a few people in line
we got in behind them as we tried to decide what we would order
the food that finally came to them did not look appetizing
everything looked like leftovers just slopped on picnic ware
it seemed to be taking an extraordinary amount of time for preheated food to be served
we decided to go across_the_street to find some lunch
i won't be returning to this place
with the overpriced groceries and poor service
it is enough to keep me away
compared to a typical indian grocery_store
this place is very clean and organized
all the isles are properly marked and doesn't smell like a temple
mixed smell of about mil incense sticks
kitchen looks very clean and some great items on the menu with close to homemade taste
their inhouse sweets are just ok but they are fresh
not frozen for a week shipped from ny or chcago
my only issue here is service
the lady at the front cash_register is so rude
i don't even go inside the store because if her
absolutely no greeting
no smile and if you ask her a question
lets just say you'll regret it
edit
service has somewhat improved and i feel the review should be changed a bit
changing from start to till my next visit
keep up the good work
anyways
here are my very accurate ratings
cleanliness
organized
variety
food kitchen
service
location parking
i thought this place was kind of hard_to_find as most places on sahara are for some reason
i went here specifically to buy some vatika oil for my hair
the product itself was not hard_to_find at all since all of the hair products are literally the aisle right behind the register when you walk into the store
they're always fully stocked and the clerks are nice
rani's was my first visit to an international food market so i was a little nervous that nobody would speak english for some reason
perhaps an ignorant assumption
but i've had good experiences here
i thought that las_vegas would not have an international food market and i would have to go online to buy my vatika oil but i did not
i'm very pleased
i would call this a hidden_gem
probably not as big as some stores you'd find in nyc but i don't think that would be a fair comparison
the first person you see as you walk in
is this lady cashier
who seems miffed she does not greet you or say hello and when you get past her
you notice an older man and he is also miffed
then you realize this man is the owner
who has set the trend and tone for this place
every one in this place looks like they just woke up and no one has a smile and all they they have a demeanor of personnel in a funeral parlor
the older man serves the food and then when you are ready to check out
the same man is at the cash_register
it is obvious that they are oblivious to the health department regulations or they just don't care
couple of helpers
a man and woman
who are toiling and tormenting in the kitchen
seems to be taken advantage of their servitude and they are clearly overworked and it shows
the old man walks around like he is pissed off at something and in fact
everyone seems to be pissed off
also the same lady who did not greet you will take your money like she is a gestapo agent and you have to watch the bill closely
since she does some tricks with the prices that surly does not match the price on the grocery as mentioned in the reviews before
i also agree with one reviewer who spent and had to change a note for three cents change
in fairness the food is decent
but they buy salt from morton's wholesale
if i want good indian food i would go to the newly opened india_masala buffet on east flamingo with both north and south_indian food and over items for the same price these zombies are charging and you can gulp it down with a glass of red_wine and not have the
tension
and unwelcome attitude as here
as far the groceries i noted fungus on the pita breads
when i brought it to the attention of the old man
he shrugged it off and put it right back in the bin
i had to buy it and throw it away than risk someone get sick
this alone is a reason not to shop at this place
they want to make money and they don't care if you get sick with a fungus and drop dead
a man is judged by how he treats his own countrymen
by that standard
this is a scum of the earth cheapskate who should not be in hospitality business
one has to be devoid of any self respect and desperate to shop here
since you and your money is parted not with a smile but by a stern looking svengali
i would not eat or shop here even if this was the only place in town
not sure why many of the posters give it a low rating
i loved the store
the people and the fresh food
the free_chai didn't spoil the fun either
check it out folks
but don't expect white glove service
after all it is an indian grocery_store
however
i thought it was a great place compared_to_other indian stores here and in other cities
tip
in the back
do ask them for what's fresh off the kitchen and try it
if they have
mirchi bajji
fresh
it is a must have with the free_chai
the food here is amazing
just like grandma would make it in india
paranthas are really good
this place is neat and clean
simple food cooked home style
i usually stop by the kitchen area and get the thali to go
last time i went
i forgot to tell the person putting the food on my tray that i wanted it to go until she had already put the rice and item on a tray
she said
i would have put it in containers if you had told me earlier
and she just continued to put it onto the flat tray
she then foil wrapped the tray but i had to do my minute drive home making sure to take corners slowly
the bottom_line is that the staff need to take a little extra time to do things properly
at no time should a server say in essence
i would have done things properly but
they seem a little understaffed and the staff appear to be a bit undertrained
overall
i still like coming here because they have a good variety of indian groceries and the food is good but customer_service definitely needs to improve
the food you get is closest to mom home_cooked indian food
stars for food
the complementary tea could be better
my friend is a die hard rani's fan
so he dragged me from my strip hotel so we could eat pani puri and chaat at this hole_in_the_wall restaurant tucked_away in the back of an indian grocery_store
the store itself seemed a bit disorganized and the staff not super friendly
not like i expected great service though
but the food was delicious
we started with the papdi chaat which was delicious
one thing i noted with this dish which is different than most papdi chaat dishes i've eaten in the past is that the papdi was extremely crispy as though they made these just for our order
the pani puri was also delicious and the chutneys are amazing
if you're in vegas and want to get away from the strip and try some local
non hotel
food
check out rani's
i like rani's
i've only been there once
but i will_be_going_back
soon
actually
i'm running low on tea
we had heard about rani's from a friend who is big into international food
i love indian food
and indian culture
so going to this store has been on the list for a while
one day
i decided that i needed to find dabur amla oil for my hair
i used to use it back home in chicago
and it really helped me with a number of issues i had with my hair
detangling
for one
i called rani's and the gentlman on the phone was very polite and helpful
we went in and i found the oil right away
and they had a huge selection of it too
we looked around at the groceries
and i was pretty impressed
they have a really good selection of spices
and teas
they have huge boxes of pg tips
which is my tea of choice
i used to get it at fresh and easy
but then i tried the international market over on decatur
which was cheaper
well
rani's has it cheaper_than that
they also have bollywood dvds for cents
i'm going to have to brush up on my bollywood cinema and pick_up a few
i used to buy and rent bollywood movies all the time back home
honestly
being in rani's brought me back a bit
i found and bought a little bottle of lychee juice
something i hadn't been able to find in the almost years i've lived here
we also tried a samosa from the kitchen
and the free_chai
both were really good
d
i can't_wait_to_go_back
d
this gastro gem instantly connects me with my former lifetime
s
in india
rani dishes up some sumptuous home style food at the back counter
with the love of a dotting grandmother
the tangy and fresh chutneys accompany her rich and flavorful veg fare perfectly
her pakoras are a hearty treat
and one of the few deep_fried foods i'll indulge in
because how can you say no to your adopted indian grandmother
the rest of the store is a delectable journey through spice
i can easily lose track of earthly time here
to my less traveled western epicurians
know this is not like the international isle at whole foods
expect
hindi tv
ghee scented air
tables sticky with chai resin
and dusty nag champa boxes to abound
all part of the authenticity and love that is rani world
i recently read that india does irradiate their spices like we do in the west
so buying indian spice products are both cost health effective
but do check expiration dates
my staples from these illustrious isles include
star anise
tumeric
chana besana flour
rose water
peppered pampadams
yellow split mung beans
aspativa
basmati_rice
mustard seed
cinnamon bark
ghee and the beauty of fresh curry leaves from the produce section
i love love love indian food and this place is the best place in town to vegetarian variety
i actually grew_up not to far from this grocery cafe but i never knew until a recent trip to the adjacent zia records that the market also sold food and boy do i wish i could kick myself and go back in time lol the food is so flavorful and i recommend the potato parartha and pretty much anything else on the menu
i can't stress enough how fantastic the food is
update
i went back here about two weeks_ago to pick_up a big box of tea
they were closed
so
my friend and i were going to get back in the car to go kill time till they opened
the older woman who runs the kitchen knocked on the glass and motioned for us to come in
she opened an_hour early for us
that is grade a service
the young lady who rang us up commented about me making
a cup
of tea in a joking manner
so we joked a little
but then i said how pg tips is my favorite
and she and the older woman made conversation with me about how its their favorite too
so personable
and spectacular
i cant speak highly enough about this food store
i discovered_this_place when my boyfriend's sister moved in
apparently they have a location in california she frequented
buy
spicy cashews
they are absolutely_amazing
if you like nuts
i sure do
and anything spicy
you will absolutely love these things
lentils
the most affordable place i have found to buy them in town
indian spices
if you are learning how to make indian food
this is a great place to buy prepackaged spices that make making curries as easy as making hamburger helper
the staff here is very friendly_and_helpful
i personally wouldn't buy my produce here
some of it looks kind of old
everything else is wonderful and affordable
they carry henna and amla products for coloring the hair naturally
although i felt_like they watched me the first couple_of_times i came in
they are always friendly and answer questions if you ask
the smell of the spices through the store is delicious
the owner runs the kitchen and let us taste everything
it was delicious
we ended_up eating lunch there
will be back for more
the food seemed overly salty and lacking in spiciness i had the thale
and i thought the potatoes in the aloo metha were a bit under cooked
the food was also a bit watery
i wanted vegan
and the staff made some suggestions which i took
very tasty
very helpful and friendly_staff too
unfortunately
for me
i wouldn't know how to order se
asian vegan dishes
so i have to ask for suggestions
but the suggested dish
es
were tasty and varied
the staff helpful and friendly
and other diners friendly as well
this is a no frills section of a supermarket with maybe small tables
free chai_tea
and i was stuffed for under
i adore this charming little store food spot
not only can i find a lot of ethnic items here
but the food is amazing
you can taste the home_cooked love that goes into each dish
it's indian food at its best and you_can't_beat the prices
love_this_place
the food is delicious and very fresh
i took my meat eating husband and he loved it
i am a part time meat_eater who loves vegetarian_dishes and this is the place to go if you love food with spice
i really could eat about a dozen of the veggie_samosas
the mint_chutney is delicious and i will be back for more roti and aloo
i love spices and rani has plenty
so for all you cooking folks
this is the place
i've been to their houston
tx location and now las_vegas
next stop california and i've yet to be disappointed
went back for more veggie_samosas they were so good
hot and crispy
i am in love with the mint_chutney
first and foremost it's an indian grocery_store and everything about it is super indian in every way
rani
the owner is as indian as one can get and she's a delightful character
just don't expect american customer_service from her or her staff
groceries are plenty and diverse
and her food is authentic and delish
the free_chai is hard to beat
i love it
it reminds of the scene back home
i just came back from india and kept craving real indian food
i found it at rani's
paneer
samosas
barfi all were real good and authentic
the prices are also almost like in india lol
their selection of spices and dahlia is also very impressive
this is my favorite store now
forget the whole foods
when we went to vegas
we had planned on daily trips driving to places around vegas
and so we wanted a place where we could get food on the go and start with our drive
came across rani's world foods with a google search and it couldn't have been any better
we didn't shop at the grocery_store but the food and service at the kitchen was so good and the cost reasonable that we decided to stop by and get our food for the next days and even for dinner
the lady in the kitchen
rani
is the best
highly_recommended
where else can you get two aisles devoted to lentils
a cricket bat
and get a good lunch and drink for under
not too many places is the answer
this place
fortunately
is one of them
a slice of indian food groceries and a bit of english tea
and a competent lunch counter add up to a delightful little place to shop
and sit and watch the videos while you're at it
order two samosa's
which are generously sized
and maybe a smattering of veggie pakora and top it off with the free chai_tea
then sit_down at their rickety tables and get transported to a strange little piece of indian culture in the form of crazy
whacky indian pop culture dance videos
that alone is worth_the_trip
i can't_speak of anybody else
but my politeness was met with politeness and the counter girl is a charmer
the old lady everyone talks of went grin for grin with me
so i'm calling that a win
bottom_line is that it is an experience and a great place to stockpile indian food supplies
so go eat
shop
and watch the videos
and since you get away so cheap
don't forget to tip
great parathas
a little pricey
the service could be better
but
going into an indian fast_food place
i had a very low expectation
the place wasn't so clean
but oh well
the food made up for it
we went back three times during our days trip_to_vegas
i like the authentic homemade indian food and free indian tea here
also i like to buy fresh okra and super sweet yellow mango
stopped here to pickup snacks on our way to ca
the store carries almost everything desired from a super indian grocery_store snacks
staples
vegetables
fruits and exotic items
the great surprise was their mini restaurant
that offered wide collection of sweets and snacks
i highly_recommend their thali
it is closest to the home_cooked
north
indian meal i had in the us
i live in nyc
so that's a major compliment
visit this place with huge bags and empty stomach
and carry_out as much as your body
bags and car can carry
if you love indian food you will love_this_place
its a brand new restaurant that everyone should try
its in a beautiful building with an amazing menu
i had the tandoor chicken_wings
reshmi kabob
and some cheese_naan
it was all amazing
it was spicy but not over powering
it was like my taste_buds went to disneyland and didnt want to come back
my friend from india was also with me and she was glad to finally find an authentic_indian_food restaurant in the north west part_of_town
so if you want to take you taste_buds to disneyland too give saffron a try
long time lurker on yelp but finally writing my first review on a well deserving place
beautifully decorated restaurant and very accommodating staff
the owner raj recommended the chicken pakora appetizer for our year_old son since he can't_handle anything spicy
it was so tasty that i had to refrain from eating his dinner
we ordered the lamb_vindaloo and chicken madras both extra_spicy
both entrees were fantastic but the chicken madras was the winner of the two and will be our staple dish every time we visit
the garlic and cheese_naan were a must to mop up every last drop of our entrees
they do have a lunch buffet which i look_forward to trying many of their offerings
but i can see having dinner here on a regular_basis
this is by_far_the_best_indian restaurant in town
really great place
we had dinner there tonight and sadly had the place to ourselves
however
unlike a lot of places that just seem to
give up
when they don't have a lot of business on a particular night
the staff at saffron seemed to be working extra hard for our approval
our hostess waitress was very friendly and accommodating
ensuring that we had everything we needed without hovering
the food was absolutely excellent as well
my husband had a lamb dish
which he ordered medium spicy
while i had the mattar_paneer at no spice
both of ours was delicious and seasoned perfectly
they don't seem to fall into the trap that
more spice more flavor
that i have encountered at some places where a
actually equals
nuclear reactor in_your_mouth hot
now that i know they have a fine hand at spices
i may actually order a little heat next time
we also got the cheese_naan
which i highly_recommend
tender
filled with just enough cheese to add flavor and texture without making it greasy
their menu is just long enough to give you lots of options but not so long that it's overwhelming
it has a huge vegetarian section
with lots of choices for even the pickiest eater
long story short
we will be back
hopefully next time it will be full to the rafters busy
i do not like indian food
that is
until i tried this place
they changed my mind about the cuisine and i'm thankful for that
since this place is literally around the corner
i finally decided_to_give it a try one night while having nowhere else to go for dinner
we walked in to a smoky restaurant
more than likely from the kitchen in the back
it smells like spices in the air
which was a nice change from the exhaust smell outside
their food is light
flavorful
and despite the small plates it comes on
the portions are deceivingly huge
their naan is beautiful
especially the garlic_naan
which stole my heart and my stomach
after several great dishes
from their chicken pakora appetizer crispy
light
and so darn good to beef kabob and chicken curry
the experience was an eye opener and a life changer for me
i'm a fan_of_indian_food now
so long as i eat here and only here for the cuisine
you must try it
this is the best indian food i've had in las_vegas to date
i'm_so_glad i found this place so close_to_home
my gf usually doesn't like indian_cuisine but this place was an exception
order was
chicken_tikka boti
garlic_naan
cheese_naan
chicken_korma
lamb kabob
tandoori chicken_wings
the chicken_tikka boti was my gf's favorite out of all these dishes
mine was the chicken_korma at level spiciness
makes my mouth water just thinking about that creamy goodness
the naan was perfect on both accounts
i love the flavor of those tandoori chicken_wings
the lamb kabob was perfectly spiced to where you could still appreciate the flavor of the meat
the service is great here and the prices are excellent
i'm so happy i was able to find another restaurant that has high_quality food with more than reasonable_prices
if_you're_looking for good pakistani indian halal cuisine look no further
first time trying indian food from a restarunt i am a huge_fan_of curries but this place was lacking
ordered the chicken masala if i remember right and was almost gritty because of seasoning
ordered the chicken_tikka and the saffron sampler and all the meat was cooked to death really dry
maybe i dont know what indian food should be like but the meat seemed way over cooked
also got the cheese_naan that was great
in a lonely
half filled strip_mall behind a mcdonald's
the sign
nearly missed
drew my attention one day on my way to work
an indian restaurant
up here
could it be
thoughts of culinary joy filtered into my mind and the
curry plum fairies
danced in my head
this was my second visit to saffron
the first time
my friend and i ventured in and my love sensual decor did a delighted dance
the walls are a warm
almost tuscan texture
and the windows are hidden by a dalliance of lovely
transparent
red
gold
and emerald curtains
my friend and i shared the butter_chicken and the saffron clay_oven platter
the butter_chicken held pieces of tender
moist chicken in the most delicious
buttery
flavorful sauce over rice
the saffron platter was a mix of chicken
shrimp
and indian sausage slow cooked with tandoori spices in a clay_oven
we also ordered the garlic_naan bread
which i thought was to die for
today
i thought i'd try the lunch buffet since i had some time and wanted more than my fridge had to offer
the buffet is and contained dishes
salad
and yummy indian sauces
i had the tandoori chicken_wings
a vegetable_samosa
spicy chicken curry
lamb_curry
a lentil dish as well as two other vegetable dishes
i am ashamed to admit that i am not fluent in the names of indian dishes
maybe i'll tackle that in
along with the buffet came a basket of regular naan
i'm no expert of all breads indian
but this bread was so yummy
clearly just baked in a hot oven
the bread glistened with butter over it's hot bubbly dough
it was savory with almost an undetectable hint of sweetness
all in all the food seemed authentic
not too spicy
and you know i like my spicy
but in some cases i thought needed a smidge more salt
now
i probably like too much salt
so this may not deserve the elimination of a star
in the end the atmosphere is very nice
and the staff is friendly
attentive and genuinely concerned that your experience is a good one
if you're ready to venture away from your weekend trip to applebee's
and want something that will tantalize your taste_buds
head over to saffron for some serious yum
great little place
husband and i stopped here for the lunch buffet on our way out of las_vegas and i'm so glad_we_did
i'm indian and thought the food was very good
flavors were delicate and not overdone
they had interesting dishes on the buffet menu
corn spinach curry
anyone
and it was not super heavy like indian_lunch_buffets usually are
they bring hot
fresh
naan out to your table
service was attentive and just right
ambiance is a nice blend of indian and southwestern without overdoing either
we loved it so much that we stopped by again to pick_up chicken_biryani a few days later
it tasted more like chicken pulav
but was still very good
go find this place
you_won't_be_disappointed
what a great find
thank you yelpers
i had a certificate for restaurant
com that was expiring and we wanted to try something different
after bouncing between their site and here
we decided_to_give saffron a try
thank you to whitney for posting the location behind the mcdonalds
otherwise we might have missed it
we walk up toward their open sign and get pointed to the door down tot he right
why in the world would you put that sign next to doors you do not use
anyway
we were told we could sit anywhere we wanted as we were the only ones there
the young man was probalbly new because he could not answer a question about one of the naans
no big_deal
we started with the garlic_naan
bullet naan
tandoori chicken_wings
and the sampler
both naans were very tasty and the wings were also very good
the sampler was also eaten pretty fast
even though it was a bit spicy
probably a on a scale
we were not asked how spicey we wanted the sampler
but were asked for our entrees
everything was nice and tender
everyone also loved the mango_lassi
not too sweet but yummy
of us ordered the tikka mix
lamb
chicken
shrimp
but no fish as mentioned on the menu
and our th ordered the shrimp saag
the tikka was very good
silly of us to get the sampler as an appetizer and the mix for the entree
but it was good stuff
very flavorful and nicely spiced
the girls raved_about the saag
prices were reasonable
portions were good
but service_was_a_bit_slow
we'll have to go back and try more of the many items on the menu
i thought i was in for a dining masterpiece after seeing the solid stars on yelp
unfortunately
my experience was a bit different than everyone_else
the service was pretty bad for us
we got our orders taken right away
and the food was pretty fast
but then we didn't see anyone again for quite some time
our mouths were burning from our food and we had no water
and when i went looking for someone to fill our water
i couldn't even find anyone
that's ridiculous
the food itself was ok
but not amazing
definitely overpriced
if i hadn't have gotten a restaurant
com gc
i would have felt super ripped off
as it is
i felt only a little ripped off
i guess i'm spoiled
as i remember getting like dishes for at the indian restaurant that closed on decatur and charleston
here
i barely got dishes and an order of naan
it is the closest indian place to me that i know of
so i may be back
but i won't be running back
it's easy to miss in its quiet little center
but my food eyes are vulter ific and saw that a indian place was coming soon to the neighborhood
we found they had a restaurant
com certificate and gave it a try
when we walked in we were greeted with spices wafting around which was definitely a inviting sign
they start you off with cilrantro and tamarind chutneys with papadam to nosh while you wait
bf has discovered tikka so we decide to get their chicken_tikka
so he can try more of it and see a range
it was pretty nicely spiced and the chicken was tender
i prefer a bit richer
almost creamy of a sauce
but that's just a preference that i tend to seek so this isn't my favorite version
aloo ghobi
cauliflower
potato and spices sauteed together
the cauliflower was cooked nicely soft but still with a light bite and the spices were flavorful but not overpowering
they ask how spicy you want it from
we got a and it doesn't really register any spicy at that point
we want most things no spice to mild since the bf can't eat too spicy
we also grabbed some garlic_naan
which was pretty good to go with the meal
dishes comes with rice and they will refill it if you need more
for dessert
we got some gulab_jamun
which are fried milk dough balls that gets a bath in fragrant syrup and served warm
the syrup had a light gingery taste to it and the dough was good
there were two golf ball sized pieces and though they were tasty
is not proportional to what you got
a ball is like grabbing a oreo sized cookie at bouchon bakery in the venetian and we ain't on the lv strip
service was attentive and nice
we got our drinks and rice filled and we were checked on
even though we were full from our dishes
for the price i feel it was a bit skimpy on the portions
i think the restaurant
com certificate was a good way to try this place
definitely though this area needs a place like this to bring us to more food and culture diversity so i appreciate when a new spot opens up that is something different
i'm curious about their_lunch_buffet
i'm with rob on this one probably coming_back
but not running back for more
despite the fact that saffron is a little far north for us to drive
a restaurant
com gift_certificate combined with our love of indian food convinced us to give it a try
we arrived at about pm on a saturday and the place was deserted
we were the only customers
i worried about what the food would be like if no one else was here and if it was good
how the place would survive
by the end of our meal any worries were dispelled
the food was delicious and the place was packed with hardly an empty table
the meal began with some complimentary pappadums with the usual accompaniments of mint and tamarind chutneys
we started with a serve of samosas which i initially thought looked a bit dense
but they turned_out_to_be the most aromatic and delicious samosas i have eaten in las_vegas and i found myself regretting not ordering a double serve
for our mains we split a paneer makhani
my wife had shahi_paneer and i had chicken_tikka_masala
my tikka masala was delicious
although it was a bit different to other tikka masalas i have had in the past
having a bit of a vindaloo flavour
i initially thought they might have mixed up my order
but the chicken was definitely tikka with clear skewer holes in the meat
either way
it was absolutely divine
my wife absolutely loved her shahi_paneer and when i helped myself to some and plenty of the ample gravy i agreed
very rich and nutty and perfect fodder for the delicious serves of garlic and plain_naan we ordered with our meal
the paneer makhani was also very good
although i found it just a touch runny when compared to the wonderful consistency of the shahi dish
if i had ordered it on its own i would have been more than satisfied
but next time if we split a dish i think i'll try some sort of kofta and see how that is
the restaurant itself is really attractive and welcoming
when i read other reviews that said it was in a
strip_mall
i had visions of a grotty row of shops with some cheesy red and green neon
but the place looks really classy and the
strip_mall
looks more like a business park and is only brought down slightly by the presence of a honking great mcdonald's out front
service was great and friendly
water was refilled promptly and they did well handling the sudden influx of crowds
prices were decent
i would say the main_dishes were a couple of bucks more expensive than your average indian restaurant and appetizers were a dollar or two cheaper_than average
so if you're ordering a bit of everything it should work out about even
saffron_flavors_of_india is a great addition to a growing list of quality indian establishments in las_vegas
it's of the highest quality and ranks among the very best
to the point where the thirty to forty minute drive from home won't daunt us in our future dining decisions
we_will_definitely_be_back
hubby and i went last_night on a recommendation from a friend
it was pretty quiet when we got there only tables of people
the decor is a surprisingly pleasant m lange of tuscan southwest indian
with gold
crimson
and sage being the main colours
server was friendly_and_attentive
we ordered a chickpea marsala and a lamb tikka
both featured tasty
spicy sauces
the naan was fresh from the oven and was lovely with the entr_e sauces
everything seemed really fresh and nothing left a bad aftertaste
portion_sizes are deceptively large
the prices are a little higher_than i expected
but i suppose one could split an entr_e or two to try to save some
i would come here again
saffron_flavors_of_india
not to be confused with plain old saffron on east di
is the first indian chinese fusion restaurant i've seen
though traditional dishes found on the menus of most indian_restaurants make up the bulk of the menu
some interesting plates catch your attention immediately
one dish that sounded particularly enticing to us was the paneer chili
an appetizer of homemade
mild indian cheese dressed in a sweet and sour sauce with green peppers and onions
i know it sounds strange
but it was actually quite successful
the sauce wasn't sickeningly sweet and artificial tasting as sweet and sour often can be
and we loved tasting chinese flavors in a dish that actually had some heat
non fusion dishes were just as successful
the sauce of the lamb_rogan_josh
was a deep brick red and flavor packed
letting you know someone loved it for awhile
my mushroom and sweet corn masala
was served in a sauce that was equally complex and flavorful
yet i was disappointed to see that canned mushrooms were used
the sauce was so incredible
however
i really didn't mind at all
anyone who can make canned mushrooms taste so good gets a big culinary thumbs_up from me
i also enjoyed the addition of corn
which replaced the more common peas found in many indian mushroom dishes
fun little extras included a superb raita with crunchy chunks of cucumber and crispy onion pakora
if you love onion rings
the latter is a must try
we also loved the bullet naan
a flatbread stuffed with cheese
potatoes
chickpeas
onion
cilantro
and green chilies
it made me think this restaurant could do well as the first indian pizza joint
sadly
i fear this restaurant may not survive due to it's location
it's actually fairly easy to get to as it is right off the at craig
but the new strip center it's in is dead with no signs of budding life
i hate seeing these mom and pop's dissolve r
i
p taqueria los parados and vegas cafe
i hope i can entice you to go by mentioning that restaurant
com is currently offering certificates valid for dinner only
today they have off for st
patty's day with the code lucky
but if you sign up for their updates they offer discounts just as deep nearly every week
you can also same money by taking advantage of their great lunch buffet
the number of items is limited
but it's a bargain at just
i had thought that i had already reviewed this great restaurant
but i guess i haven't
i greatly recommend it
i would also like to point out though
as i have sadly come to realize twice in the past couple of months
that the restaurant is closed
not for good i might add
it seems due to a family emergency
i'm sure i
or someone else on here
will update when they open back up
i can't wait
rolled over there for the first time
and it was closed up
with a note on the door saying the chef was out of country due to a family emergency
however
they will be back
major bummer for me
but i give them stars for the note
the positive_reviews
and good wishes for the chef
and his kin
we just happened to call them for carry_out because we wanted indian food and they were the closest one to us
i didn't know it was there first re opening night and oh what a treat
my husband had the lamb_vindaloo and i had the lamb_korma with both garlic and plain naan_bread
the entire meal was amazing
they were busy but the bartender britney was super_nice and talked to me while i waited
we will_be_going_back again
but this time to sit and dine
really happy that they opened back up so i could finally try them
my mother and i went for dinner on a friday_night around p
m
the establishment is divided into two areas
there is a bar on one side and on the other side is the dining_area
there were a few tables occupied but not busy yet
two very cheerful servers greeted us and after being seated asked if we had any questions
everything on the menu is ala cart so it can be pricey
they brought us a basket of papadum and couple of chutneys
the green chutney was my favorite
while the red was a little too sour for my taste
we started_off_with two mango_lassis and paneer_pakora
my go to drink at any indian restaurant is mango_lassi
i can usually down of them during the course of a good meal
these did_not_disappoint
nice and creamy with just_the_right_amount_of sweetness and perfectly smooth
the paneer_pakora was huge
not really that used to appetizers at an indian restaurant being that big
we were going to get full before the meal came
the pakora was crispy and brown and we also spread the chutneys that came with the papadum on them
the paneer has a bit of a nutty flavor and is sort of the consistency of very firm tofu
for entrees we ordered butter_chicken
tandoori_chicken and kadai ghosht
the butter_chicken was good
i got it at spicy level
was not to enthused about mom's tandoori_chicken
it came out all sizzling and hot on the plate but the piece i had was flavorful but dry
mom said i must have picked the only dry piece on the plate since her's were pretty juicy
i think my_favorite_dish was the kadai ghosht
it is a lamb_curry with onions garlic and ginger
it was very tender and succulent and the flavor was out_of_this_world
we also had panner naan
good
and garlic_naan
very garlicky so very good
as well as they served us a small dish of basmati_rice to share between us
now as far as the service goes
it's the type of service i expected
i don't think i have ever been to an indian restaurant were the servers are snappy
they are not bad but if you are expecting to be in and out the you are out of luck
they were very cheerful and quite helpful
our server was a bit too eager to clear our plates away
even when we hadn't finished yet
i was a bit alarmed to hear a server recommend to a family a vindaloo when they asked what was a good dish that was not spicy
but considering they go on a to spice_level for every dish i suppose that was okay
ordered the paneer_tikka_masala
shrimp saag
and tandoori_chicken and they all tasted so good
i highly_recommend saving room for dessert and trying their pista kulfi
so rich and yummy
the best indian food i've had yet
hidden in a little corner on craig and tenaya
my boyfriend always told me about this place
but it had temporarily closed down due to the cook having to go back to india
i saw the reviews on here yesterday that it had reopened and i called to confirm
we went last_night
they are only open for dinner hours until they get their clientele back up
soooo
for dinner we had the following
shrimp korma
rogan ghosht
and the mixed tikka platter
we had everything on a spice_level
and it was perfect
everything was delicious and i cannot wait_to_go_back again
oh
my jesus this was excellent
as soon as we walked in i could smell the aromas and fell in love immediately
i have never had indian food that was so good
the hubby dreads indian but decided to spoil me
he was definitely surprised
this is the only indian restaurant food he has ever liked
bad first impression
the waitress was a little off
there were of us
she looked around and told us that we had to wait_for_a_table to open
hmn
but there were open tables
another guy came by after a few minutes
pushed two tables together and seated us
yay
minutes go by
no menus
no water
no waitress or waiter
a couple of more minutes and the waitress brings us some pakora and water
no menus
wth
i really wanted to try this food
otherwise we would've be out after minutes of waiting
so
we flag her down and request menus
it was smooth sailing after that
and boy was it worth the hassle
if i could afford to go a few times a week i would
i was craving this as soon as i woke up and again tonight
a la_carte meals are on average and they're not big
not a good match for a food lover on a budget
my hubby and i were craving_indian_food tonight so we went to saffron
we ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
vegetable_korma
veg
samosas and the plain nan
we eat at saffron about once a week but the food was especially excellent tonight
i got food poisoning from this restaurant
i would not recommend_this_place_to_anyone
do not be fooled by the good reviews
this place is also pretty pricey
this is the best indian restaurant in las_vegas
i have been before and after the hiatus
and everything i have tried has been nothing short of amazing
the vegetable_biryani is fantastic not overly greasy
and incredibly fragrant
i ordered it
spicy
and it was a religious experience
the dal_makhani is also delicious
rich and creamy
but not overly so
as this dish can sometimes be
the naan is always hot
fresh
and fluffy
the environment is inviting
and the staff is very accommodating
pro tip
take a date and sit in the romantic
more private section
so pretty
spend the extra few dollars a dish
compared to the average indian restaurant
for an experience that is amazing
i will_definitely_go_back to this place
before saffron
i have been to only indian_restaurants which disappointed me enough to be wary of the cuisine altogether
i am so glad my husband took me here for 'something different'
walked in
had a saffron martini drop
an original creation
and decided
yup
this is gonna be goood
appetizer
chili_chicken spice
wow
bread basket
garlic and cheese_naan
my son scarfed that down
had chicken_tikka_masala and lamb masala
yum
staff were very nice
restroom was clean
a bit of a drive from the strip
but from this experience
was well worth it
my son and daughter in law ate there last_night for her birthday with a for coupon we got in the mail and they loved it and the portions were big enough that they were full and had left over to take home
don
t ask me what they ordered but they said it was spicy but not to spicy like they experienced in other indian_restaurants
the food is great but the hours are terrible
i finally got a chance to go here after work
my rd attempt
i tried a couple more times for lunch but they weren't open
i wasn't in the mood for curry
so i had me some chicken_tikka
i was thinkin some veggies so i got kachumber salad too
the server suggested garlic_naan also
so when all the food came out
i get embarrassed
the portions were huge that the cook came out to move another table next to mine
i did the best i could but man vs food
i am not
i had enough leftover for the next day
my advise
bring a friend you wanna impress
i'd come back
when they're open
save yourself a trip
management was very rude to us after my year_old son got severly ill from their chicken dish
apparently the waitress could not tell us what was in the sauce and we had to run out of the restaurant and was severely ill all weekend from the food they served
i will not go back to this restaurant and do not recommend
round for saffron_flavors_of_india
why has it taken so long if it's so good
you ask
because i'm on a damn budget
we
of us
were_seated_immediately with menus this time
that sure made ordering food a lot quicker
i think it helped that our waitress was not the same and knew how to waitress
had the bullet nan
saffron platter
and goan fish
absolutely loved the goan fish and bullet nan
saffron platter was ok
i would've tried some other items but on those
small portions
and a coke
i'll save up for next time
damn
y u gotta be so 'spencers
after a long hard day of fieldwork
i stopped in to saffron on my way back to the hotel to pick_up a to go order
the chef graciously took my order even though they were closed at the time
pm
back at the hotel
i eagerly dove into my kadai chicken boneless chicken in a sauce of i don't quite know what but it was delicious
slivers of ginger and surprise pops of coriander seed
yum
i inhaled it with my aloo naan
and was in heaven
now i am in a food coma
but i will definitely come back here for a proper dinner the next time i am in las_vegas
my hubby and i just did take out from saffron
we have a ritual where we share an indian beer and an ap at the restaurant and take the rest home
tonight the food was particularly on
the chicken_tikka_masala was perfect
the veg korma was right on
and the veg samosas were pretty great as well
this is the best indian_restaurant_in_vegas and i could eat it every week
yay
i'm a fan
so i was going home from this side of town
and i desired a bit of good eats to arrive home with
here's a shout out to yelp for leading me to this place
i never would have stumbled across this tucked_away place otherwise
even if i happened upon this establishment
i'm not even sure i would have guessed it to offer take out
there's enough class inside that i actually asked if they even did
and soon found out i would be one of three doing the same
there is a separate dining_area from the bar
but from the passersby
i guess it to have accommodated them nicely
the bar area seems to have a full compliment
and the tender definitely seemed to know his way around it
not that i sampled
i sat at one of the few bar tables and watched the television they had up
i was very kindly offered water or soda while i waited for my order
a first for me when getting take out
after perusing the entire dinner menu
i settled on the chicken_tikka_masala caught my eye as it brings together the joys of the tandoor
grill oven
with curry
luckily the dish comes with rice
as you really don't get a lot for the money here
what you do get is quality over quantity
but i'm a fan of both
i was asked on a scale of to how spicy i wanted it
after discussion that i'm a fan of a little heat
we concluded that i should try an
well
the tickled some
and it was flavorful not just spicy for its own sake
it certainly carried the graceful interplay of spices and textures of good indian food
it had an acceptable amount of chicken that was cooked_to_perfection
delish it was most definitely
first timer
and now we will be back as often as we can
i never had indian food ever and the server was very nice and helped me figure_out what may like
she did great
the heat index was perfect and i love the flavors with the all the dishes we had
the bar was nice
the tables nicely laid_out and the staff was very pleasant
i love these flavors
cheap it is not but quality it is
top_notch
spring rolls were fried but super tasty
the begay korea with tofu was sublime
rice basmati was fluffy and light
extra order is dollars but needed if you want enough rice to have rice with your second helping that you will not be able to resist
the garlic nann is perfectly done
next time i will add cheese to the naan for extra goodness
also had the beef shank indian style
it was insane
i bet every dish here is good
try the tikka chip everyone was ordering it
enjoy star at to star prices we had drinks and it was but would have been without alcohol
they do take out too
loved it all bravo
raj and ritesh
thank you for a great indian restaurant in the northwest
if you love real authentic_indian_food you have to give saffron a try
my wife and i love it
by_far_the_best_indian restaurant in vegas
they went away for awhile and i swear i was in withdrawals
me and the girlfriend love_this_place and the owner is just great
we came out one day and they weren't open but the chef was cooking and he cooked for us as well
not only great food but great owner and a great chef as well
our favorites
garlic_naan we always get like orders of this its so good
chicken_tikki_masala
lamb vindoolo
butter_chicken
all of these and everything else they have you will love
definitely worthwhile
the only thing is that they need to get the takeout menu back up so i can get it for lunch regularly
wow
for all the great reviews
no one seems to mention that the food amount to price ratio is off the charts
you're going to spend a lot for a little
having said that
the food is tasty
our waitress seemed like a new summer
high school hire so we didn't feel too much love from her and it took a bit to get her attention even though we were the first group in the dining_room and eventually only one of two groups there
who made the same quizzical look at the food when it arrived
based_on its small size
again
i don't mind spending a bunch for great food
but a small bowl for over seems steep even in vegas
and this is no where near the strip
and that bowl was advertised to serve two
ha
nice ambience
the best indian food i have eaten in las_vegas
very good indian food with a wide selection including more traditional dishes i wasn't familiar with
it is a small restaurant but always seems busy without being packed
service was attentive
a little pricey
e
g
chicken curry dishes were
but overall very good
decided to visit this place during a weekend getaway to vegas after seeing reviews_on_yelp and trip advisor
food
tastes great
we had chicken_tikka_masala
butter_chicken
chili shrimp
spiced to taste
smaller portions
one entry feeds adult
garlic_naan was excellent
kids swore it was the best they've ever had
the fact that they had indo_chinese choices was a huge plus as well
only con was the dessert
they lost a star for this
gulab_jamun was not good at all
and they still charged us for it even though i said it wasn't edible
they serve it cold
and the insides were rock hard
overall
this was the best indian food i've had in a very long time
decor
elegant
nothing too fancy
but tasteful
in a quiet
residential area
service
very friendly
at times a tad slow
not too sure who our server was
at times it was a guy
at times it was the hostess who was quite nice
cost
a little pricey
entree
bill for adults and kids was without drinks
this indian restaurant is a gem and is definitely worth visiting
especially if you live in the nw part of the valley
i took my family and my sister's family from california and all seven of us absolutely loved the dining_experience
we started_off_with vegetable_samosas
which were full of potatoes
peas
and maybe some carrots
while the pastry could have been a tad thinner and lighter
it was delicious nevertheless
for
we got two large samosas
for our main_course
we ordered chicken_tikka_masala
chana
chick_peas
masala
tandoori_chicken
garlic_naan
chili fish
and garlic shrimp
the last two items were part of the indo_chinese section of the menu
every one of the dishes was well prepared
nicely presented
and very flavorful
the restaurant was clean and spacious with ample parking
i have been to or different indian_restaurants in las_vegas and this one is one of the best
i wish i had a better experience at his place
because i normally like indian food
maybe also we ordered the wrong item
but it just wasn't or stars for me
we went there on a thursday i think in the afternoon and we were the only people in the restaurant
nothing to complain_about the service
we ended_up ordering the combination platter to share
the selection of meats on the platter was very good
but i felt_like something was missing
the platter didn't come with any sides or sauces
we ordered the garlic_nan on the side
but everything was very dry and hard to swallow
i wish the dish came with rice and a sauce or something like that
especially for the price they were charging
prices_are_pretty high in my opinion but i think i will go back if i get a chance and try and order one of their saucy dishes
this first experience left me very unsatisfied but i'm willing to give the restaurant another chance
wowzers
i am so so glad that i strolled into this place and check ed it out
i was craving_indian_food so incredibly badly since i left dc and with no one out here expect for my coworker
who i can't lunch with during work
with a palate for indian_cuisine
i decided upon the first place i saw on yelp
i saw the yelp_reviews and decided lets go
thanks everyone
i was seated within seconds of arriving and received my beverage within a second of sitting down
the waitress then asked me if i wanted garlic or regular naan
and being me
of course i ordered the garlic
she guided me over to the buffet
and basically told me to dig in
my eyes grew wide i started with a salad with the delicious cucumber dressing and little jalape o
tay tay tasty
then i went and got my main meal
i loaded up with some rice and then piled the curry chicken pepper splashed some of that ritata sauce on there and headed back to the table
after piling a mountain of food onto that yummy delicious warm garlic_naan i shoveled that food down so quick and went for seconds
and then thirds
ahhhhh somebody stop me
in my many trips to the buffet bar i also tried the garlic chicken
which was good
almost a little dry
but it made the cut for me and then something else
to be honest i didn't even look at the name
i just dove in and took it
it might have been the chicken masala come to think of it
overall the experience was a great one
for the meal and i will definitely_be_going_back
possibly as soon as next week
stop everything you are doing this very instant and get going already
great flavors
but beware if_you're_looking for spicy
you're gonna have to beg
we ordered dishes at an level
one was a vindaloo
and both were very bland
the other problem is service
nice
but incredibly stupid waitresses
our bottle_of_wine was dropped off with our glasses but never poured
we poured every_single time
also
the server never checked to see how our food was until we were totally done flagged her down for a check
she was surprised that we weren't happy with the spiciness hello
why didn't you ask
also
even after she brought the cc receipt
she still didn't clear our plates
yuck
but we'll come back for takeout
just will ask for a or indian hot
ok
so me and the mrs
had a hankering for some good indian food and saffron delivered big time
we had a few different naan's
aloo_gobi and a rajma
all were fantastic
the staff was friendly
we did take out so i am not sure how the service is for dine in
however the dining_room was fairly full so i would venture to say the service is good
anyone on this side of town would do well to give saffron a shot
we were missing our favorite place in sd
did a yelp search and came up with saffron
it was really close so we decided_to_give it a try
it's in a quiet strip_mall so parking is plentiful
although at first we saw it as a red flag
we quickly decided that wasn't the case
the ambiance is a little off
you walk into a really brightly lit bar area
with no recognizable hostess station
although we were greeted quickly and with a big smile from the bartender and were passed off to a hostess who seated us immediately
here's where i do not really know how to express myself well
everyone was happy and helpful
the place is bright and cheery
but something is off
i think the tables are as welcoming and maybe the place has too much lighting
sort of reminded_me_of a cafeteria that had been dressed up with some bright colors and lot's of curtains
the important part the food
was awesome
we ordered chicken samosas and chicken pankora's to start with
both were excellent
we especially enjoyed the samosas
the chicken meat was ground and mixed with wonderful spices
very very tasty
for dinner we ordered lamb_vindaloo and chicken masala tandoori
again both plates were fantastic especially with the garlic_naan we ordered
we really enjoyed our dinner and the staff was very attentive
we never wanted for anything
i would like to see the ambiance set up better for dinner
something less bright and maybe a little more intimate
this review is for the lunch buffet
why stars
not only is it an excellent value for the money
but everything is fresh and delicious
i am not an indian food guy
so i don't know how authentic it is or how it compares to others
but i will tell you
it will be hard finding a better way to spend the same money for lunch
the garlic_naan bread was amazing
we ordered two baskets for the table and it was devoured quickly
some of the best
bread
that i have had
so so good
i liked most of the dishes i tired
but a few of the meat dishes stood_out
and were great to eat with the accompanying dipping_sauces
a few times the serving food went empty since it was very busy
but that meant fresh food was coming out within minutes
only bad thing
they were really busy
and it didn't look like their was much help on the floor
the poor guy was literally running around in circles and was forgetting refills and pulling plates
but that was hardly enough for me to drop the review down a notch since it didn't ruin or affect our lunch here too much
i will be back again
i say go for it
especially if you live on this side of town
saffron's lunch buffet is just ok
high points
very good value
awesome garlic_naan
low points
very small selection
and when we were there we were the only customers and so the food was never refreshed
the service was good
but i would expect that considering we were alone in the restaurant
i would've liked to see a few more selections
there was saag_paneer
a chicken dish
fish_curry and i believe a veggie curry
accompanied_by some onion pakora and fried chicken strips
nothing was bad but nothing blew my mind
either
i still have yet to find a vegas indian buffet that i like better than mint
i never had indian food before visiting saffron
after meeting the owner
raj
on my first visit
he was very helpful in menu selections and really cared about our liking what he suggested for dinner
we have been back several times since and have always had great food and great service
i would recommend this restaurant to everyone
thank you raj for a great experience and even greater food
great food
warning
the spice_level is i had a thinking it would be med
i was wrong it was pretty spicy
can't imagine a
some have said it's pricey
but i didn't think it was any more expansive then going to chilies or outback
if you want good food your going to pay for it
on a whim
since we were in the area
we thought we would give this place a try
oh man
i am glad that we did
it was d licious
the hubby ordered the chicken j
don't remember how to spell the rest of it
and i ordered something that wasn't even on the menu
but they were more than happy to make it for me
they had a shrimp korma
but i wanted chicken instead
we both had our meals a spicy out of
it was goooooood
it was spicy enough for me and i love things spicy
also
if you check into yelp while dining
you get a discount
check it out
tried saffron_flavors_of_india for takeaway dinner on a whim and came away very impressed
the food was excellent
small thing
for me
when i arrived on time for pickup the food wasn't ready
another takeaway customer arrived and had the same problem
they've got some timing issues
but i was able to easily overlook that by the quality of the food
which is for sure the best available in las_vegas
and i've tried just about all of them
while i waited for my food i noticed the restaurant looked great
a large
fully stocked bar and a comfortable
modern dining_room
for me
saffron is a little out of the way
but i'm happy to overlook that too for their excellent food
glad to have found it
wow
what a great restaurant
let's start with the tandoori_chicken
often a dry
if tartly tasty
disappointment
an afterthought in the vegetarian marvelousness that is indian food in general
here
though
it was richly flavorful
moist and yielding seriously
the best i have ever had
the people raving about the garlic_naan bread are absolutely right fresh baked
with just the right level of browned bottom
the service was very pleasant maybe a bit over attentive
because we arrived at a slow time
that's a shame
because quite honestly
this restaurant should never have any slow times
the decor is lovely draped curtains
mellow
classy atmosphere
it's not a hole_in_the_wall by_any_means
overall
an outstanding restaurant
and i hope it catches on soon
saffron_flavors_of_india gets stars for customer_service and amazing food
on a whim
i stopped in to see about take out
they didn't have any menus but offered to email one to me
the restaurant is on the way home
so i can call in the order and it is ready by the time i get there
the food is always delicious and i have a weekly craving for the naan
i really need to try out the lunch buffet sometime
stopped in for the lunch buffet
should have arrived earlier than
pm
as many of the dishes needed refilling and were somewhat slow to refill
i chalk this up to a possible combination of the fact that it was almost hours into their hour buffet window
and that the dining_area was maybe half full
the buffet itself featured a small but nice selection
i tried the following
rice
chick_peas in a cheese curry_sauce
mattar_paneer
lamb masala
fish_curry
orange chicken
onion pakora
onion strips fried in a chick_pea batter
garlic_naan
there was another chicken dish
but it was never refilled so i did not get to try it
their best dishes were the garlic_naan
which was pretty great
and the fish_curry
which was tasty but could have had more of a kick to the curry
the rest were somewhat above_average
the service was good and the atmosphere was nice understated decor with some soft indian background music
i give it stars overall because i enjoyed the food
despite the small selection and slow refilling
the nature of a buffet greatly limits the degree of the spice heat in the food
so i can't judge them on the spice_level
or lack thereof
it was a pleasant lunch
but i'll have to try some regular dishes before i can render a more definitive verdict
went on a tuesday night and the place was almost empty
too bad for the missing customers as this place is great
ordered two apps
then the mixed_grill
the chicken_biryani and the shrimp_vindaloo along with bullet and garlic_naan
the portion_size on the biryani is immense
tasty as well
my wife enjoyed the mixed_grill
especially the tandoori_chicken
i ordered the shrimp_vindaloo with a spice index and it certainy packed a punch
i really wish they offered chicken_vindaloo as well
maybe in the future
the bullet naan is something special and the garlic_naan did_not_disappoint
service was very good to begin with
but got a little slow near the end of the meal
we had to wait a bit for to go boxes for the leftovers
overall
very good food and good service
we will be back
the skinny
came in for their_lunch_buffet and was greatly disappointed with the lack of selection and the quality of some of the items
for f
k's sake they f ked up kheer
service was good nothing special though
value
given the plethora of indian_restaurants offering buffets in the valley
this one ranks poorly with regards to price
selection and quality
came in because we'd heard they were starting to do lunch_buffets
add the recent promotion of off
we were psyched to try it out especially when it's a lot closer to our neck of the woods
i was really surprised by the lack of selection available considering the price
for
there were hot items
including rice
with a small salad fruit bar and kheer
but this would be okay if the food was fantastic across the board
however it missed the mark
of all of the dishes
the standout was the goan fish_curry
the fish had a lovely texture while the curry was wonderfully mellow
however
you were pretty much dumpster diving to look for pieces of fish in the curry
other than that
everything else was okay
lamb masala
chana_masala
paneer masala
to not so great
of the not so great items was the dal
bland
the orange chicken
soggy
overly sweet i'm not sure how this fits in with everything else this s
t is about as american as apple pie
and the kheer
i have to take a minute about how they messed up the kheer
not only did they cheap out on the rice
they used some sort of long grain instead of basmati
they may have used leftover rice to make it with the rather large clumps of rice emerging from the pudding
if you stirred the rice while you were cooking it
this doesn't happen
in addition
the rice was undercooked and hard
plus you don't even get that hit nice hit of cardamom at all
bleh
major turn off
the garlic_naan came to the table nice and hot and flavourful
however texturally
it was a little too hard
a little too doughy and not enough flakiness
sporting a tomato chutney
an unpleasantly weak mint_chutney
where's the mango_chutney
and a rather watery raita
i was disappointed by the lack of pickles and other condiments normally seen at other places
given the plehtora of places available in the valley that offer better selection
better quality and overall better prices
i'd skip this place for the lunch buffet
starred review
stopped by for lunch with a few coworkers to get additional opinions and to order something off the menu with some kick to the spice_level
the other three
one of whom had never eaten indian food
none of whom had been here before
ordered the lunch buffet
and i ordered the chicken madras
chicken cooked in madras curry
at level heat
i was very pleased with the chicken madras
a nice blend of flavors savory
spicy
a bit of sweetness combined with a pleasingly spicy kick that complemented the flavors rather than overwhelming them
the naan
we had one basket of regular
one basket of garlic
was excellent as well
served warm
crispy
and chewy
everyone enjoyed their food
and the other fan of spicy foods also liked the bit of chicken madras she tried
finding it spicy flavorful but not overpowering
service_was_prompt and courteous
and the overall experience went well
given my second experience here
i'm bumping my score up to a
i don't get over to the w side too often
but decided to go out of my way to try this place after spending a morning working red rock casino recently
no complaints about value lunch buffet in this town's pretty much the standard
pretty decent of items offered too
specifically
chicken_tikka korma
saag_paneer
aloo ghobi
garlic_naan were all good
i'll be back
i've visited this establishment twice
once for dinner and more recently for their reopened lunch buffet
for dinner
the food was okay
but the service was severely lacking
it took forever
about hours total
to order our food
get water and refills
get our food and finally pay our check
the butter_chicken was so so
the aloo_gobi even less remarkable
the kinds of naan were too doughy
despite this mediocre experience
i was willing to give their_lunch_buffet a try
especially since the wifey was curious to experience their cuisine
what a mistake that was
first of all
the price of
is at the high end for indian_lunch_buffets
and this place is the exception to the rule that you get what you pay for
the selection and quality was downright pathetic and frankly embarassing
ok
to be fair
it was still better than our abysmal experience at sherpa house
in golden
co
but that is setting the bar extremely low
there were a whopping total of hot trays consisting of items such as onion
pakora
basically onion ring fragments
orange chicken
daal
chana_masala
goan fish_curry
lamb_curry
paneer masala
and
non basmati
rice
there was also a small salad_bar section and kheer
there was a surprising lack of classic staples such as mango_chutney
samosas
tandoori_chicken
any kind of chicken curry
or saag
although we enjoyed the fish_curry
it could not make up for the lack of selection and quality of the rest of items
the garlic_naan was so so
it was simultaneously too doughy yet too hard and dry on the bottom
the kheer was the worst we've ever had
it lacked cardamom flavor and contained numerous clumps of rice
at least this time around
the service was half decent
the only other mitigating factor was they were running a off promotion
although we had to specifically ask for the discount to be applied
that being said
the fact that this place garners stellar reviews is a real head scratcher
perhaps
restaurants located in the
relative
boonies are held to a lower standard
who knows
as for me
when i rate a restaurant
i don't care where a restaurant is located
the food is either good or it isn't
it's either a good value or it isn't
unfortunately
this place is neither
curry in a hurry
delish
so wonderful and tasty and spicy
i love it here
saffron is an awesome restaurant
they feature a particularly rare branch of indian food indian chinese
it is impossible to find indian chinese_food
let alone good indian chinese_food
i had the chili paneer
it was life changing
it was fantastic
i just wish this place was so out of the way
otherwise i'd be way more often
so good
they have other indian options too
but trust_me
try the indian chinese_food
i went yesterday
saturday
to their buffet
it is not a big buffet but it was very good and had a variety of choices
the tandoori chicken_wings were out_of_this_world great
and
the curry dishes were very good
i even tried one called goon fish_curry and it was probably the best of all
very good curry dish and the fish was very tasty
you can get regular or garlic_naan bread with your buffet
i got the garlic and it was really good
hot and fresh
the place is very nice and clean
i went once on a weekday and once on saturday
the buffet is on wednesday through saturday and the weekday wasn't very busy but there was a nice crowd on saturday
i will_definitely_be_back
tandoori_chicken and shrimp_vindaloo is what i got there and dollars
tandoori had about med pieces chicken level spicy and it was spicy
the shrimp_vindaloo was a good big portion recommend if in the mood for shrimp and balsamic rice
if you want indian food it is really good but pricey
great food and awesome service
definitely will go here again
love saffron
raj and the team
the food is amazing
the freshness and quality is very good
highly_recommend
we had the lunch buffet and was very impressed
they had a fish_curry dish one of the only indian food buffet places i've found with this
lots of flavor heavier on cumin and spices than an average place
which we love
also very clean and excellent service
our quest to find the best indian lunch buffet in vegas continues
protip
this isn't it
my wife and i had been here for dinner before and it was actually quite tasty
so we trucked all the way up to craig on a weekday afternoon to try the buffet
and sadly
it didn't live up to our expectations based_on dinner service
the naan was still amazing
but the buffet selection was downright paltry
my firang side was pleased with the usual chicken_tikka and pakora but i come to a lunch buffet to try a variety of different things
if saffron would devote more space and effort to the lunch buffet instead of cramming a small selection into a tiny alcove
it would be worth a return_visit
the food quality is actually very good but the limited selection just kills it for me
oh saffron what have you done
ok firstly i have been going to saffron since they opened at their new location on craig
i like there lunch buffet but sadly i'm giving a bad review not because of the food but because of the lack of food during my last visit
i went in on feb th at pm i was seated quickly like i always am
we went to get some food and noticed almost everything was out
i assumed they would still be cooking since they closed at
and they usually just cook small portions and refill the food
however after minutes i noticed that they weren't bringing anything out
i asked the server first about my water since i never got one then about the food
he said we're closing so no more food is cooking
i asked why no one would tell me this when i sat_down and the server repeated that they close at
he said he would ask if anything else could be cooked and came back again stating they close at
i can't believe that after coming so often to eat that they wouldn't have the courtesy of letting me know that i would be paying full price for pieces of cut up chicken and some rice
maybe they should institute a last call or something of that nature
i actually loved coming here for lunch but ever since this happened i have been driving past saffron to go to mt
everest
mint or namaste depending_on my mood
p
s please bring back the tandoori_chicken to the lunch buffet
i am pretty sure this is the only lunch buffet in vegas that doesn't have tandoori_chicken available
i am going to give saffron_flavors_of_india a rare five_stars from me tonight because quite honestly
i have nothing negative to say
a_few_weeks_ago told a different story
i had a craving for curry on a monday night but saffron is closed on monday
i did not know this until after i tried three doors before seeing their hours posted on the first door revisited
i was frustrated
today
though
is wednesday and saffron is open
i parked at about
in an open and empty lot
as i approached
a man opened the door and warmly welcomed me in
good impression number one
i was seated_immediately as the restaurant was mostly empty much to my surprise
when i was seated i noticed the strong aroma of the many exotic spices i would be enjoying shortly
i also noticed the indian music lending itself to a comforting and authentic dining_experience
good impression number two
within less than a minute of being seated i was brought a glass_of_water
a food menu
a wine menu
a basket of crispy flat_bread stuff
apologies for not knowing the true name
and two sauces
a mint sauce and a tamarind_sauce
the latter of the two sauces was my favorite
i took a few minutes to familiarize myself with the menu
i settled upon palak chicken and a side of garlic_naan
the naan came out quickly and was absolutely_delicious
it was hot
crisp
and chewy with plenty of minced garlic on top
a few minutes_later my palak chicken came out in a hot bowl and accompanied with long grain rice in a separate bowl
the palak was a brilliant green from the spinach
it was topped with cream and a sprig of cilantro
a beautiful presentation to be sure
i had trouble finding the chicken until i spooned it on to my plate
it was there hiding out amongst the spinach base
it was not the most tender chicken i have had at an indian restaurant but chicken does not need to be fork tender to be good
it still fell apart in my mouth
good impression number three
i ate all of my rice but took my palak chicken and garlic_naan home to have for lunch_the_next_day
my check came as i was bagging up my leftovers
it had a smiley face drawn on it
talk about service with a smile
good impression number four
this was very much a comfortable and relaxing dining_experience
from the soft spoken and friendly waiter to the delicious food cooked to my spice request of
out of
my night at saffron was just what the doctor ordered
i will be back but probably not all too soon
it is a little high priced as indian_cuisine tends to be
but when the hunger strikes
an occasional splurge is in well within reason
i would go back for the chicken_tikki_masala the garlic_naan
just remember
the portions are small
so
don't expect to be getting a huge entree of chicken
for the price
i think they could've given more chicken
the small curry_bowl was filled chicken and sauce
naan
it was absolutely_delicious dipping the naan into the masala sauce
what made it most enjoyable was the surprise crispy texture on its bottom
almost like an indian pizza
mom had the aloo ghobi seemed to be disappointed with the dryness
she kept on saying how it was missing something something
since this dish isn't familiar to me
i had no idea how to compare
we also had the vegetable_samosa
surprisingly
it was not fried
but baked
mom was quite upset about it and said it would've tasted better fried
i agree with her
but i did think it helped cut back on the calories
perhaps
if they used filo dough
the thick pastry would've been a better choice
for me
it was a star visit
for mom
probably a star visit
i'd like to return for their buffet just to see how they cook the other items
what a total disappointment
i was naive and did not listen to some of the reviews here
the biggest complaint i have is price and quantity quality of food
i ordered chicken_tikka_masala and lamb with spinach curry or something like that
first
the flavor was nothing special
i actually thought it was bland and something i could have made myself
second
the prices are ridiculous
look i don't mind paying a lot of money if it's worth it
i've been to gordon ramsay on paris and del friscos double eagle steakhouse
both expensive but totally_worth it
the prices
chicken_tikka_masala was
serve in a
i kid you not
dog's bowl size container
inches in diameter and inches deep
little cubes of chicken and the rest was sauce
the lamb
same as the chicken_tikka
little pieces and the rest was sauce
i felt totally cheated
i give this business a few more months and it's going to close down
people please listen up and spend it where you can get more bang and flavor for hour buck
trust_me on this one
go to mt_everest on sahara or something similar but not this one please
so i have eaten at over indian food restaurants around the world and this is in my top
food is always consistently good
service is exceptional
the owner and wait_staff knew my preferences and what i wanted by my third visit
i have tried over ten items on the menu and every one of the dishes sampled was great
while i don't usually eat the garlic_naan with my meals theirs is the best i've tasted
i highly_recommend you try this place
update to mr rajesh p who responded to my review
yes
i am talking_about the same saffron restaurant on w craig rd
i spent years in the uk and have dine in over indian_restaurants
i'm pretty sure i know what i am talking_about
indian_restaurants in europe are more authentic i may say
so much so that at one point the uk made chicken_tikka_masala uk's national food
or
it was still a small amount of food for the money
just try going to one of the known indian_restaurants around here and you know what i am talking_about
bottom_line
food quality quantity is not worth the price and i believe people need to know this before going
since leaving england years_ago
my wife and i have been in search for a proper indian restaurant in las_vegas and we finally found it
saffron_flavors has a great selection of tasty indian food and selection of alcohol beverages
and kingfisher beer
the staff is very kind and are willing to make different dishes to your liking
i prefer the chicken phall and chicken_vindaloo because of the spicy taste which raj is more than happy to make it as spicy or not spicy just the way you want it
you can find my wife and i driving from nellis afb to visit every saturday for their_lunch_buffet at a very good price
whoever says you get very little food for the price here at saffron_flavors is definitely used to the other less reputable indian food
joints
that las_vegas has to offer
cheers
very good
got there at the end of lunch and the waiter had the chef prepare fresh main_course rather than have us eat the buffet
suggestion for lunch arrive before
great place for dinner
best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
nice_atmosphere
pleasant service
this is much better than many of the more expensive places near the strip
the food was great but i felt the amount of money spent for food was high for what was received
even the lunch buffet is good
you can't_go_wrong here
the buffet is amazing everything i mean everything is delicious naan_bread comes included with the low price
very nice clean restaurant
best aloo_gobi in town
the yummiest indian food i have ever tried in the town
specially try their indo_chinese dishes
great food
nice restaurant and awesome hospitality
not like other typical indian restaurant in the town
yup so i finally bit the bullet and went back to saffron
i drive by it so often i had to give them a chance
and this time they did_not_disappoint
i have to be honest and say i've been back a couple times but just to make sure that it is consistently good in order for me to finally upgrade my review
looks like they listened and now have tandoori_chicken all the time for the lunch buffet
the food has been great and you no longer have to worry_about what time you're planning on going in
they seem to be cooking fresh good up until the end
all of the food here is usually pretty good
not usually spicy but all the flavors are still there
and their garlic_naan here is one of the best
the service is really good everyone chips in to make sure the food stays full and your glass is never empty
i'm always seated quickly here and i have to say they've really stepped it up
i can now officially recommend_this_place again
although it is still not my favorite
i love really spicy indian food and they don't deliver that here
i will definitely hit this place for a quick indian fix
back again for the lunch buffet
all chicken curries and no fish this time
yes
i'm on my rd plate of food and slowly getting the itus
lol
if you don't know what itus is
google it
saffron is a wonderful indian restaurant
the ambiance is very elegant and warm
it makes you want to stay or get a drink at the nice bar
the buffet
and let's face it buffets are why we eat indian in the first place
was well_stocked with a variety of delicious
perfectly spiced dishes
the nan_bread was some of the best i've had
just light enough but very filling
the food was decent and the garlic_naan was great
my main problem was with the service
during the lunch hour
there were few people restaurant
despite the small crowd
the server was inattentive
the biggest problem came at the end of the meal
our party had a gift_certificate from restaurant
com for dollars
saffron refused to honor the gift_certificate and claimed that the gift cards from restaurant
com could only be used at night
i asked the server where on the website and on the gift card the restriction was located
and he could not point out the clause
to those in my party
it felt_like the saffron pulled a bait and switch
it left all of us feeling disappointed
tried saffron twice
they have a few vegan items and the staff was great letting us know which items were safe for us
on our first visit the food was much better than the second
our last meal tasted burnt
bhindi_masala
okra
while the okra was not overdone
the spices were terrible
our other dish tasted chalky
much like my failed attempts to make curries using powder at home
food was also very greasy
but that is expected with many indian dishes
might give the another try when i visit lv again
my mother likes her chicken dishes so would likely go back
delicious food and friendly_staff
the first time i went i was afraid of what it would be like since it's very hidden and not too busy but
nevertheless
it was amazing
everything on their menu is great
cheese_naan is a must
my girlfriends and i go out once a week to different restaurants and we decided_to_give this place a shot
i must say i really enjoyed it
it wasn't too busy so we_were_seated_immediately
the food was delicious and the portion_sizes were sizable
i was able to take some home which was great
the dinners do not come with naan which was surprising so i ordered garlic and cheese_naan for the table and i was more than happy to pay extra
it was wonderful
give this place a try
youll enjoy it
this place is great
especially for dinner
the food is authentic
the service is very personal
and atmosphere is great
however
i would not suggest going for the lunch buffet
i have been a few times and was disappointed
the best time to go is definitely for dinner
you_will_not_be_disappointed
good food
i've only been for the lunch buffet
but everything they had was amazing
you have the option of plain or garlic_naan with the buffet
the garlic_naan is delicious
great service
even though we had a carafe of water on our table
the waiter would still come by to fill our glasses while we were talking or getting food
we didn't have any problems with buffet selections running out or anything like that
as is mentioned in other reviews
i'll_definitely_be_back
amazing friendly_staff
very clean
and the food was amazing
i cant say ive ever had such great indian food
far from my house
but definitely worth_the_drive
delicious
onion baji is out_of_this_world
veggie_korma is my favorite
sauces are rich and plentiful
portions are generous and filling
owner and chef insist of higher quality foods and drinks
the only downside is that the service lacked regarding refilling water and drinks
my mouth was on fire and i mostly had an empty water_glass next to me for the meal
overall
i would highly_recommend this for someone who enjoys
clean
affordable
and tasty indian food from the northern region
i would say that indian is one of my cuisine types where i am extremely picky and exacting
there are no many examples of tandoori spices and curries which seen hastily thrown together
in las_vegas there are no shortage of these types
saffron unfortunately falls into this category
everything was okay
hence the three star_review
but really nothing stood_out
something like the tandoori_chicken were very good
while the curries were thin and only mildly flavorful
i'm not sure i will come back
it is only blocks away from my house so i may give it a try again when i get the indian craving
i would recommend mt_everest on sahara or mozen at mandarin oriental for top quality indian in the city
my friends and i enjoyed every dish that was ordered
the garlic_naan was amazing
will_definitely_be_back
we enjoyed the butter_chicken which turned_out_to_be our favorite
the chicken_tika_masala was also good
had the garlic_naan bread but wasn't very much garlic
the place was busy but well staffed
bar tender was inviting when we walked in the door
located in an unsuspecting strip_mall right off and craig rd
i would_definitely_come_back and try more again
here we go again
this place has awesome garlic_naan
as of late
i haven't been yelping a lot but with this trend of hitting an indian lunch buffet every week
i feel the need to share
this is only a lunch buffet review
after a disappointing experience last week at a different establishment
that we drove halfway across the city for
i'm glad to write a review about the place closest to where i live
saffron_flavors_of_india has a good lunch buffet
let me explain
first off
the service is great
the staff is attentive and friendly
always nice to see great service from anyone in this town
secondly
the food selection was good and the items themselves were fresh
not dried_out
like some tandoori_chicken at other establishments
and the garlic_naan is awesome
last
the place is clean
there's really something to be said for this
i've been to some other places and the glasses
or the water
are cloudy
or the buffet itself isn't appealing due to spilled items next to the buffet or on the floor
etc
while this may not be the biggest place or have the biggest selection of items
the place is clean and well organized
now with those things said
i'm sure there are those of you who may be thinking
hey
i read a few other reviews and they mentioned that there weren't that many items on the lunch buffet
i sort of agree
then again
consider that the items they have available are not always the same items day in and day out and that the things that are on the buffet have great flavor
it's
for the lunch buffet
it's not some huge dinner feast
and it's not
will get you a sandwich and a drink at the place across_the_street and this is a much better option for the same money
also
if you were thinking about it
since i mentioned sandwiches
the bread here
the garlic_naan
is really good
i really need to come here for dinner
i'm sure it's probably just as good if not better than their_lunch_buffet
as for the price
is fine
we're in vegas and typically anything worth anything is
if it's
and it comes with great service
well
there ya go
honestly
i'd probably pay
for a few baskets of their garlic_naan
i have been here twice to make sure it wasn't a fluke
this place is behind a mcdonalds and in a business type building but don't be fooled
it has a great staff and it's one of the more elegant indian places i've been to
most are somewhat eclectic
the food i can only say i've tried things
the shrimp and rice
non spicy
very flavorful and moist
both times
the garlic_nan
a must
it's not too garlicy
vegie samosa with dips
these were not greasy at all
they were not dry whatsoever
i will take my picky ass husband next time and make him eat here
and he will like it
where do i begin
this is by_far_the_best_indian restaurant i have ever been to
i've long been a fan of indian cusine but was weary about my boyfriend testing it out
i need not have worried though because i think he might have enjoyed it more than i did
the food was the best i've ever had
and the service was great
the dining_room was a little warm
but it was beautifully decorated and had a nice_atmosphere
i cannot wait till our next visit to vegas because this will be our first meal
it's a nice escape from the strip but isn't inconveniently out of the way
parking is easily accessible and it is located in a safe area
we love saffron
best_indian_food_in_vegas
my friends and i went to saffron on a friday_evening and we were the first ones there as the restaurant does not open for dinner until
pm
this was nice because we were able to take in the ambiance of warm tones and seating options
as more people began to arrive
i was grateful they seated the families with children in the back area
while seating the after work crowd with drinks in the front
i ordered the vegetable_korma
heat option of
and garlic_naan
i enjoy spicy food
so the vegetable_korma was a good balance of spice and creamy coconut sauce
however
my friends who are meat_eaters
ordered the mixed saffron platter and shrimp masala thought the heat option of was more than enough
the paneer in the korma had an excellent flavor and i cannot wait to try other dishes with it on my next visit
as other reviews have stated
the garlic_naan is amazing
the garlic had a fresh flavor and the bread was perfect for scooping the korma
for dessert
we ordered the galub jamun
you will get three
honey balls in rose syrup
and they are quite tasty
the perfect end to a great meal
as a suggestion
if you are going with a group of or more
you will be fine ordering a few dishes and sharing them family_style
with dishes
two orders of garlic_naan
two orders of rice
and two orders of galub jamun
there was more than enough food for the of us and we even took some home
went there for lunch to try the buffet and the food tasted amazing
my_only_complaint was that they could not keep the food on the line
i had very little of what they had to offer the first go round
and even less was available the second time up
so
i think next time i'll just order off them menu
i would totally recommend this restaurant
the ambiance is nice
the service was good and the food is excellent
however
the food portions are a little small
if you plan on sharing order a few plates
if you cannot make up your mind i would recommend the mixed platter which was delicious
it includes a bit of everything
chicken
lamb
shrimp and pork
also the spice is very hot
so if you dont like heat make sure you get it at a or
this place has decent food
but is way too over priced
per plate for mostly masala and no meat
unacceptable
sad cause the food isn't bad
also the wait_staff is condescending and not attentive
beware you walk in with adult and kids they are going to consider you a party of and hit you with gratuity
you've been warned
super spicy
the food is delicious and the staff are nice
when they ask you in a scale of one to ten how spicy
be careful if you go above five
it will be spicy
great place for veg and vegans
the saag aloo is delicious
this place is sensational
i have been looking for good indian_cuisine near me
and this place hit_the_spot
the atmosphere is nice and cozy
the meats are cooked and spiced to perfection
the curry is everything you would hope and expect from good indian_cuisine
my_favorite_dish that we ordered was the combination platter of meat
which included some of the better seasoned meats i've purchased in a very long time
my only gripe is the portions in relation to the price
it is a little pricey for the small amount of food that you get
if the portions got bigger or the price was reduced
i would be eating here very frequently
as is
i don't feel like spending on a meal for two all that often
i tried this restaurant for the first time today and it is the best indian food i have had in las_vegas
the prices_are_reasonable and the portions are a good size
i would definitely recommend saffron to anyone looking for a great indian restaurant
our family was craving some indian and this spot was well reviewed and close_to_home
the decor was nice and the service was very good
but the food was unfortunately okay
the samosas were good
the tikka masala was good
the tandoori_chicken came out cold and undercooked
usually that dish comes out sizzling on the iron skillet
but we had to send ours back because it was cold
perhaps the worst dish we had was the one part of indian that we all love the most the naan_bread
the naan here is thin and almost seems store bought
we may return for a quick indian fix but this was certainly not our best experience eating indian food
ok
i swear i have a serious food addiction
its one of my favorite subjects to talk about on a daily basis
and i actually get a high from eating
but all foods are not the same
the feeling i get from one food may be far greater than that of a different food
case in point
curry provides me with one of the strongest highs i know
but not all curries are created equal
a thai curry is far different from the curries in an indian restaurant
either way curry is a comfort_food to me
it is astounding how one meal can change ones mood so completely and curry fits that profile
tonight i had a more mild curry at saffron_flavors_of_india
more so i had a full experience featuring curry
i started with the complimentary papadan and two sauces of which i am not all too familiar but i am a fan of nonetheless
i also ordered a bottle of taj_mahal pilsner style beer
for my entree i ordered butter_chicken and a side of garlic_naan
the naan was warm
chewey and perfect as always
it was the perfect accompanyment to the buttery rich chicken curry with a touch of tomato
the high from this meal was such that my eyes were half closed and i had a soft grin on my face during the entire meal
i was experiencing a sort of nirvana
and why stop there
i had my opener
my side
my entree and my drink all of indian origin
it was time to round out the evening with dessert
i thought i should trybthe galub jaman
there were two fried dough balls served in a warm rose syrup and topped with what seemed to be dried coconut
it was very sweet but insanely delicious as everthing i had tonight was
this was one of the best meals i have had in a long time
this is the stuff dreams are made of
maybe its just the beer talking
nah
this has to be the second best indian_restaurant_in_vegas and there are probably a dozen of indian_restaurants
i hope this restaurant gets the recognition it serves
the food is fresh and the restraint is clean
they have a garlic cheese_naan to die for and their chili paneer is amazing
i just hope this restaurant stays open because i only see two tables or three filled every time i go
i just love_this_place
the food
the drinks
the staff
this makes me happy
even when dining with friends
everybody walks away in a delicious food coma with leftovers
i suggest anything in their red curry paired with a kingfisher beer
saffron_flavors_of_india is amazing
this is the best indian food
also this restaurant is so clean and very special care is taken with the food
the staff is so wonderful as well
simply put saffron_flavors_of_india is simply the best
i can't wait for the curry_leaf to open up in downtown las_vegas across from the container park
these people know how to make great indian food and are incredible restaurateurs
racheal martindale
legit indian food right here
located on west craig and the
inside a tiny strip_mall opposite the gas station
if you blink you'll miss it
legitimate indian food is hard_to_find in las_vegas and if you do find half decent food it's usually some sort of infused restaurant that costs an arm and a leg that's not very good
after realizing saffrons was closer than expected
i decided_to_give it a shot and wasn't disappointed
every time i have been here for lunch buffet
dinner or picking_up
the quality and standards of this business are stars each and every time
my recommendations are the rogan ghosht
lamb_vindaloo and the garlic_naan are all top shelf
the bar at the front of house is also not a bad little bar
with large lcd screen with whatever sport you want
also it's a nice place to knock back a kingfisher while waiting for friends
the service is also a fairly oiled machine
decor is fairly simple and nothing outlandish that you come to expect from a lot of good five_star places on the strip
i realize i'm pumping this business up
and i truly do believe its a star indian restaurant
indian_restaurants are one of those hit_or_miss kinda places that can give you amazing quality or cardboard
so until they start to pump out run of the mill stuff i'll keep it at stars
overall
price
out of
cleanliness
drink
basic bar
food
service
wonderfully flavored dishes
prompt
friendly service
you'll want to order plenty so that you'll have enough to take home for leftovers the next day
saffron_flavors_of_india is a rarity because so few indian_restaurants are located in northwest las_vegas
i've been to saffron several times for the lunch buffet and during dinner
and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food
the lunch buffet is on the small side but is only
drink included
the buffet has plenty of option for vegetarians as well
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner
which has a wide array of options to choose from
i last ordered the mattar_paneer
a curry dish with peas and spices
you can customize your level of spiciness from a scale of to
if you're not a fan of spicy foods
i'd recommend staying under a for sure
for a group of
we were immediately seated and shortly_after provided with a pitcher of water with ice and what i can only describe as paper like tortilla chips with two dipping_sauces
the service is generally alright
but sometimes we've experienced servers disappearing on us and long wait times on refills
otherwise
the servers are friendly and polite
if service was more attentive
i'd definitely give this place stars
when our dinners arrived
the server placed a single petite rice plate for all four of us to share
that rice was gone in an instant and we had to order another rice bowl
other than that small minor inconvenience
everyone loved their dinners
i love the ambiance of the restaurant it's decorated well and feels intimate
there's also indian music_playing in the background
saffron is my_favorite_indian_restaurant and is close_to_home
more importantly
the food is amazing
my personal recommendations are the garlic_naan
and vegetable_samosas
i will_definitely_be_back to get my next fix of indian food
st time here
st time having indian food
i have to say i really enjoyed it
we had fried_cheese for appetizer
i had shrimp bayuri with rice
it was really good
all of it
i will_definitely_return to try other options
the service was great and the atmosphere was great as well
very enjoyable experience for a rookie
st time here and st time trying indian food
it was a very pleasant experience
i really enjoyed the food
the service
and the atmosphere
it is tucked in a small strip_mall behind the cvs on craig rd right off the
food was a little pricey but i have nothing to actually compare it to
had the fried_cheese for appetizer
shrimp bayuri for main_course with garlic_naan
definitely will try again
st time here and st time having indian food
i have to say it was pretty good
portions were decent size
had the fried_cheese for appetizer and shrimp bayuri for dinner
it was hot nd spicy
they let you choose your level of hotness
definitely worth going back
it was kinda hard_to_find
it is tucked behind the cvs in a strip_mall off craig rd neaar
atmosphere was great and service was too
i've been too saffron quite a few times the staff are very pleasent the food is tasty the ambiance is relaxed i higly reccomend
driving through lv after a long vacation we decided to end our vacation with some delicious indian food
the lunch buffet was pretty good and for a decent price
we enjoyed the food and the service was great
the chicken was a little dry in one of the dishes but it was still delicious
we'll_be_back
great place
we have eaten here several times and have enjoyed it every time
i love the chicken jalfrezi and garlic_naan
after hiking at mount charleston
four of us stopped here to try their_lunch_buffet
one of our group has been here before and recommended it
it was a good recommendation
the buffet is small but is in the size range of others
at
it's price is ok
not the cheapest
not the most expensive
the restaurant is attractive with comfortable seating
there is a separate section through which you enter where the bar is located
the buffet is in an adjoining area out of view from the dining_room
there was a selection of salad
yogurt
chutney
and desserts at the beginning of the buffet
after the initial bar
there were several chafing dishes with various foods
i tried the chicken_tikka_masala
a curry chicken
dal_makhani
onion pakora
and some fried chicken balls the name of which i can't remember
accompanying this was basmati_rice
for the most part
the dishes were good and flavorful
the dal was bland
it could have used some seasoning
the chicken balls were tasty and different
i should have gotten some chutney for that and the onion pakora but i failed to do so
next time
one of our group noted that the chicken tandoori was dry
i didn't try this but noted this for future reference
i made a second trip to the buffet to get something sweet to offset my disposition
i got one gulab_jamun and it was very good
it was quite soft
and it was not overly sweet
a very nice ending to lunch
service was average
we were there when the restaurant opened and it soon got busy but there were a couple of people working the small room
when i went to get my gulab
my dirty plate was not removed
other than this
things went ok
if i'm in the area
i'd certainly stop again
it is in the middle tier of indian_buffets i've tried
since it's the closest place to where i live
i'll be back
i wouldn't recommend coming from the other side of town for the buffet when there are other places just as good or better in the unlv area
this was a great find in vegas
a friend recommended seek this place out and it was totally worth_the_drive
i shared a few of the curries with some garlic_nan and spring rolls
all were very flavorful
the menu was expansive
inufing a few indo_chinese fusion dishes and a fair selection of vegetarian
if you are in vegas and have a taste for indian_cuisine
you should stop here
the muter paneer was a bit runny for me but tasted ok
as main entree i had the karahi murghi keema massalla
which was good but not awesome
it's somewhat odd to see only western dessert in the menu
but nevertheless the one i had
something with biscuit and ice_cream
was excellent
will give a try again in the future
close to the marriott
easy walking distance
but they deliver for anything over pounds
order online
food arrived fast and very hot
food was good quality for the price spicy mushrooms were excellent

indian food in north scottsdale
yea
same corner as mastro's and walgreen's
i'm looking to go again
and see if they rate another star
after the start up issues dissolve
i ordered garlic naam bread and chicken_tika_masala
both very good and nicely presented
prices_are_reasonable
for this neighborhood
only open for dinner
and no weekend buffet is planned yet
we were at the park behind mastro's with the twins
we decided to walk around this plaza to check out if there were any new places
we saw this new indian pakistani restaurant
it looked really nice and i was not sure i wanted to subject them to my twins
they are not bad
however they are two years old after all
they were very nice and accommodating
they were even gracious enough to remove the tablecloth
my baby girl thinks she is a magician or something because she wants to pull tablecloths all the time
we placed one order of chicken pakora for the twins
i was not sure they would eat
well
they gobbled it all up in seconds
i couldn't believe it
so we placed a second order
we also had the regular naan and the aloo naan
both very yummy
i had the samosas and my husband had the chicken karachi
very tasty
we will be back it was a great experience
i am so happy i don't have to travel miles and miles to find a great indian restaurant
nice people
great food
a really nice white linen place
loved the chicken karachi
naan
samosas
chicken pakora
wife had a lovely red
i had a nice premium margarita
good food
worst service on earth
staff has no_idea_what is in their food
manager argued when we got bill with multiple errors
too bad we will_never_go_back because of horible experience because food was pretty good
walked out shaking our heads at how poorly trained the staff is
went to this place on a friday_night
it is relatively new so there weren't alot of people there but a decent enough crowd
decor was more like generic italian restaurant than indian
but again it's new
the food was great
good indian food in north scottsdale finally
we had the lamb tandoori and chicken curry and both were excellent
along with the garlic_naan we ate every bite
the wine_list was a bit short and unimaginative
and you couldn't really order side dishes of many things like paneer and such
but perhaps these will evolve
we'll definately be back
excellent indian food
very fresh and subtley spiced and cooked
much better than most
relaxed and upscale atmosphere
pretty busy on a wed night
highly_recommended
went there last_night with a group
everyone really liked the food and the service was excellent
we shared different dishes
the lamb masala was particularly good
as was the tandoor chicken_tikka
this is the best indian food we have found in the valley
our group has been to many indian_restaurants in england
canada and elsewhere
the decor is a little plain
but is clean and new
second try for al_hamra and again we really liked it
great flavors
lots of spice
i'd agree with a previous poster that there is alot of sauce for a relatively small amount of meet
but the sauce is soooo good all you need is a little more rice or naan and you are good to go
this time tried the samoas deep_fried so not my favorite
like the m baked better
also the lamb byrini was just ok
the rice was a little greasy for my taste
however the chicken curry and paneer tilkka masala were spot on and very delicious
plus some ofhte best garlic_naan i've ever had
we'll definately go backand it is nice to have some good ethnic alternatives in the far north valley
nice meal and good service
very good indian food
this is what scottsdale is lacking
slightly pricey and they charge for some of the extras you get for free at other indian_restaurants
but overall very very good
highly_recommended
i have been twice
the first time was during their pre grand opening and the food was good
i went back again last week
the food was fantastic
i eat home_cooked indian vegetarian food couple times a week so i'm picky
the vegi dishes were twice as good as any other indian place in az
the price is higher
but reasonable for the location
the roti and naan is also very good
was just in az for vacation with my mom and went here after purchasing a restaurant
com gift_certificate
we thoroughly_enjoyed it
location seems off the beaten path at least for us tourists staying in north phoenix
definitely hard_to_find in the dark thank god for gps
we went on a sunday_night place was fairly dead
i think there were only other tables dining while we were there
it is a fairly large restaurant esp for being in a shopping_center
we ordered the samosas
regular naan
chicken lorna for me and coconut chicken for my mom
the samosas and naan were the best i had ever had
the naan was super light
fluffy and warm
the samosas had a nice crunchy outside not soggy and chewy like at a lot of other indian_restaurants
the chicken was cooked_perfectly very tender and sauce had a lot of flavor
i've dined at several indian_restaurants
in boston primarily
and this was my favorite
my mom had only had indian once before
with me in boston
and she didn't care for it so she was hesitant to try it again but she really liked it
although neither of us were starving when we got there
i still think the portions were enough for meals
our waitress was quiet and shy to start but warmed up after awhile
we ended_up really liking her she was quite friendly
i don't recall her name but she was from serbia
would_definitely_recommend_this_place
fabulous food
i had the chicken_tikka_masala and my mom had the lamb_korma
i went
not so hungry
but cleaned my whole plate
service was very friendly
we took the take out menus home
as this would be a perfect alternative to the usual rotisserie chicken or chinese take out
north scottsdale has needed a good indian restaurant since i moved here twelve years_ago
my wife and i dined at al_hamra a couple of days_ago and can report that our demand has at last been met
seeing a vindaloo on the menu had me correctly guess that the chef had arrived in the usa via britain
which has a long history of indian_cuisine
we started with samosas after which i had the lamb_vindaloo and my wife tried the chicken_korma
all very good
for dessert
we were presented with a complimentary rice_pudding
also good
prices are in line with the location expect_to_pay a bit more here in the pricey north scottsdale location
decor was a bit nondescript really very little indian character and in my opinion needs a bit more attention to set the tone of the place
nearly full restaurant on my visit
very polite service
they take their heat seriously
as the mint_chutney was a solid on a scale of
saag and chana_masala were flavorful and good portions
plain_naan is the winner on the bread menu
for price and taste
didn't care for the garlic_naan so much
restaurant is tucked behind two other restaurants
a lamp pizza place and a bistro
easy to miss
prices are insanely steep and beyond the norm for this area
entrees include
premium
rice
dinner only
friendly service and comfortable setting
hasn't been crowded on any of our three visits during past month
consistently good food and value for the price
we appreciate the diversity it has helped add to the pinnacle peak restaurant scene
we will keep_coming_back
great high end indian restaurant in the phoenix scottsdale area
expect_to_pay more for the location
order the tandoori_chicken and anything vindaloo
dishes are pricey but good
service is great especially from the cute eastern european waitress
stay_away if you are really hungry and on a budget
i learned to love indian when i loved in london for years
this place is a train wreck
it is abv
appallingly bad value
over
priced
they even charge for papadoms
horriible service and decidedly marginal food
we were a party of three
only two other tables were occupied when we arrived
although it was almost full when we left
minutes after we ordered the waitress brought our rice
minutes_later
the first entree arrived
ten minutes_later
the second arrived
minutes_later
the third
i ordered lamb_vindaloo
now vindaloo
by definition
when authentic
is so hot it will take off the top of your head
but i get it
this is arizona
were veal is exotic
and so i was not surprised to be asked how spicy i wanted it
on a to scale
i asked for
the dish i got was a
at best
no spice at all
the rest of the food was mediocre as well
and this place is expensive
caveat emptor
we have been looking for a good indian restaurant in phoenix scottsdale
thus far we have been disappointed at the quality
al_hamra was a complete delight
lovely
simple
clean decor
polite service
and the food was delish
so often i find indian food is swimming in oil
we had an eggplant curry and a chana massala and both were wonderful
their papadum and naan
especially
were wonderful
if you are vegan or vegetarian and want a nice meal
i would highly_recommend this restaurant
they can make your food spicey or mild
and
if you have meat eating friends there are many
many excellent selections
so nice to eat in a civilized restaurant that offers tasty
well prepared food at reasonable_prices
delightful restaurant
had the lamb sagg
heat
and my daughter had the chicken_tiki marsala
heat
we both enjoyed the selection and appreciated the free appetizer with sauce
heat
to know how to gauge the heat index
the garlic_naan was outstanding
and our server was friendly_and_helpful
will_definitely_be_back
oh al_hamra
i love your chicken_tikka_masala and naan like no other
the service is wonderful and the decor delightful
and the wine_list extensive
but please
forbthe love of god
play some music
it is so quite in there that the other patrons discussions
clear across the room seem loud and distracting
they need music to create ambience and privacy
its almost akward
great food here
i will say its a little pricey but i guess on par for the location
i will defiantly be back
i've been to this place twice now
and it does not disappoint
everything i've had
mostly the lamb dishes
has been incredibly tasty and tender
the staff at al_hamra are very nice and attentive
they make good recommendations and don't hover over you as you eat
the decor is nice
fairly standard
but not down market by_any_means
after all
it is in a decent area surrounded by high income rooftops
the only problem i have is i wish more people would go
i've only been on weeknights so i can't_speak to the
hopefully busy
weekend crowd
but this place could use a couple more people discovering it and becoming loyal customers
it is pricey
which may be a result of the location
but it's better than most other_indian_places i've been
give it a shot and you_won't_be_disappointed
that really good indian restaurant in the phoenix area has eluded us we've tried at least that were supposed_to_be
it
so this time no one recommended al_hamra it's just been on my way home for as along as it's been open
it was worth stopping very good lamb_vindaloo
spice_level packing some heat
and a variety of other dishes that we tried
my wife liked the samosa but i was thinking 'so so'
all in all the chef has a fine touch and the food is very solid and well above_average
although a bit pricey
as you might expect for the location
most of the recommendations by others seem spot on
recommended
stoped by on sunday_night
only two tables in the place bad sign
harried fustrated waitress ordered a beer out of stock
second choise out of stock
asked for chutney out of stock
ordered lamb kebob out of stock
i am seeing a trend here
had three entrees they were ok i really wish there was a great indian place in scottsdale any recommendations
give al ham
ra a skip
my boyfriend and i frequent this little indian restaraunt often
the wait_staff is always super helpful when we want to try new items and are all very kind
try their fish coconut we can't get enough of it
their naan with chicken is also a crowd favorite
this is hands_down one of the nicer looking indian_restaurants in the city
located in a very upscale part_of_town
it keeps up by having very good ambience and very professional service
all this comes at a price
literally
this is also one of the priciest indian_restaurants in the city
the food by that standard not the most amazing i have ever eaten
the food is satisfactory though
i had the lamb_biryani and the chicken_makhani which were both done good
so come here for a fancy night out when you are prepared to pay more for a decent meal
if
however
all you are craving for is good old indian_cuisine and do not want to burn a hole in your pocket
there are plenty of other alternatives in the city
easily our fave indian_joint in town
deep rooted spices
never disappointed with any of the curries
samosas are divine and naan done right
a must try for all indian_cuisine lovers
palak_paneer and benghan bartha were wayyy too salty for anyone's taste
not sure if it was msg or salt but it left us feeling a little ill after dinner and we could barely eat any of it
the garlic_naan was delicious and the rice was good
the waitress seemed hurried and not as hospitable as one would expect
this is a great restaurant and i don't understand why it isn't busier
the location is great being just off of pinnacle peak and pima rd
unlike many indian_restaurants the decor
crystal
plates
silverware are really nice and elegant
they have lovely indoor and outdoor dining options
the cuisine is simply outstanding
the quality of the sauces
meats
vegetables is top_notch
our waitress was delightful and the owner manager came to our table and he was very nice and knowledgeable about his cuisine and indian_cuisine in general
this place has to catch on because i get the feeling that if it started getting packed
it would be one of the more popular restaurants in northern scottsdale
we will be regulars
disappointed on valentine's day
what a bummer
have been wanting_to_try this place for a year
we drive by it on the way home every day
my wife found a groupon deal
so we bought
followed the groupon instructions
m th only
only to be told after our meal that they would not honor the groupon
aside from the groupon mess
the service was extremely slow
the food
while tasty
was way overpriced for what we've found elsewhere in phoenix
restaurant is nice enough
tablecloths
good silverware
and our waiter was working really hard
unfortunately
there were way too many tables trying to be served by one guy
i won't mention alternatives here
but we have found a wonderful
affordable vegetarian indian restaurant in town
for a vegetable_curry dish is a bit much
even if it is n scottsdale
maybe it was because of valentine's day
but no indian families in the place
the other place we love is always full of indian families
kinda tells me something
horrible service
we had to wait minutes for the waiter to acknowledge us
the food is ok
we had dinner here the other night and really enjoyed ourselves
the food was very good and the service was excellent
have not had much luck with indian restaurant
this was a very welcome surprise
we eat here pretty regularly the food is consistently good and there are a good variety of options covering many regional dishes
including many great vegetarian_options as you would expect for indian_fare
i've been to india and indian enclaves throughout asia
and the food is consistent with the real thing
the heat spiciness is also consistent with how they serve it in india
i
e
hot is hot
they ask for your your heat preference
so for your first visit you may want to dial it back a notch from what you might normally request locally
the place is big and clean and bright
but as others note there's not a ton of character
service is friendly
and we come enough that they recognize us and welcome us back
as some have noted it can be a bit slow at times
not always
but i think it's consistent with the food being prepped fresh to order
full disclosure
i was born and raised in the sub continent so my expectations are quite different from the average joe who's view of authentic mexican food istaco bell or of authentic italian pizza is pizza hut
i provide these qualifications because my comments may be from a very different perspective
for american indian food it's okay
for the real old country food it deserves no more than a star
s that's the story
we just returned from dining at al_hamra with friends and had to comment on the great meal and service we had
mario
our waiter
was knowledgeable and friendly
our orders came promptly and all were excellent
we ordered the samosas and onion paneer for appetizers
we had the shrimp_vindaloo
the chicken with coconut
the chicken curry and the eggplant_dish along with aloo naan and mango_chutney
all had the right amount of spice as ordered and were tender and very tasty
it's been several years since we dined at al_hamra but we will_definitely_go_back
no lack of flavors at this restaurant
the naan was some of the best i've ever had
other notables were the bhindi_masala
palak_paneer
and aloo ghobi
the tandoori meats were delicious
all items are cooked to your spice_level
we chose four and that was plenty
halfway through dinner
i shifted into sport eating mode and got myself one helluva tummy ache on the drive home
it was that good
i'm paying for it today
well
not really
my wife is
lamb_korma and garlic_naan were the best i have ever tried
food has it is unique flavor and by far
the best indian food i ever had
superb mughal classics
served with great style in a gentle and relaxing atmosphere
great wine_list
too
which indian_restaurants often lack
prices are higher_than most neighborhood curry_houses
but the quality of the ingredients is definitely worth the splurge if you truly love this cuisine
a great place
this place was fantastic
we had great service
the waiter was very helpful and friendly
he made great recommendations too
i had the lamb_vindaloo and my husband had the chicken_tiki_masala
both were very tasty
we will_be_returning soon
the food here is great
very authentic
the service however is horrible
two of us ate here on a saturday_night
there were only two other tables and two waitresses
they both should be working somewhere_else
preferably where they don't have contact with other people
their skills were really lacking for a hospitality business
i hadn't had indian food in years and a group of us decided to make it our ethnic food choice for our get together
i read the yelp_reviews and we all went
i can tell you it was all everyone said and more
the food
the friendly service and the very nice restaurant owner made our experience one to remember
the chicken_tiki_masala
samosas
lamb_vindaloo and everything else was full of flavor and delicious
the naan was to due for too
this is a place to put on your favorites list
al_hamra is a nice indian food restaurant
that sounds like a pretty basic statement but that's kind of the point
my experience was not remotely bad nor was it remarkable
our waitress was attentive and friendly and i would give it four stars if it wasn't for the fact that one of the dishes we ordered was a lamb dish that was overcooked
but i took them home for leftovers and it was oddly better
we got chicken_tikka_masala
garlic_naan
and lamb_chops
chicken_tikka was exactly as i hoped and the garlic_naan was perfect
it was flavorful and on par with what ive had at other establishments closer to home
i wouldn't order the lamb_chops again but id order curry dishes without any hesitation and be confident that they are good
the lamb_chops however as i said previously were overcooked
if you are in the area than i would recommend trying it out
its a great looking place with great staff but unfortunately is hidden in the mastros complex so deep that its more word of mouth than anything else
you certainly wouldn't drive by and know its there
it is however absolutely worth trying if you have a craving_for_indian_food
excellent
really good indian food
i am non indian but fan of any type of curries
i have tried almost all the indian_restaurants in las_vegas
but this one has the most different and authentic tasting indian food
they have really good biryani and chicken curries
plus point is that it is in henderson
i had food there last year but it wasn't good so i stopped going there
but i think the owners have been changed and they have created this into a very nice_atmosphere with friendly_staff
i am happy that i don't have to go far for great tasting indian food anymore
i recommend taking your guests to this place
to be perfectly honest
i was slightly disappointed
call me obsessed
but i came in fully expecting to see murgh makhani in one of the lunch buffet trays
unfortunately
all i saw was its boring cousin chicken_tikka_masala
on the bright side
the absence of my_favorite_dish caused me to try a lot more than i usually do
i was happy to see goat_curry and it was pretty good
the other dish that stood_out for me was the mutter_paneer
i didn't care for the cheese
but i enjoyed the peas and the curry was a decent dipping sauce for the garlic_naan
this is where murgh makhani excels imho
incidentally
i did see murgh makhani on the menu
so they definitely serve it
i just wish it was in the lunch buffet like at namaste
for that silly reason
i give the edge to namaste
but taj_palace is still a ok
update
still no butter_chicken in the lunch buffet
however
i did find a new item that i enjoyed quite a bit methi chicken
the sign says the dish contains spinach
if that's true
then it's not methi chicken
maybe they just figure it's easier to write
spinach
than to explain what
methi
is
in any case
it was good
i've also discovered kheer
it's an indian rice_pudding finished with nuts
raisins
and cardamom
for some reason
i've never had this dessert before
but it is absolutely_delicious
despite butter_chicken still being mia
i think a star upgrade is in order
so someone would call me crazy for yelping this place again and i usually don't even yelp
i was craving their food again so had to make another trip there
i really had a great experience and this time i went with my guests and they loved it as well
stars this time because i know the staff is really friendly but i think the person who takes the order just need to speak up a little bit
he speaks so softly that i have hard time understanding so i am just hoping for an enthusiastic person to take my order next time
i would go again to eat
went there today and let_me_tell_you that's one amazing buffet they have or i should say the best indian_buffet_in_town
i have no idea how they are surviving over items for just
had a chat with the chef and he knows what he is talking_about especially when it comes to food he is one knowledgeable person
over all awesome place to go for buffet
i am going there for dinner tommorow with bunch of friends and looking_forward to it
bit excited
long story short best indian food in whole las_vegas hands_down
henderson finally has a good indian restaurant great food with a friendly_staff
it very much beats the long drive to its best competitors in tough parts of town
we've tried the buffet three times and plan on returning about every other week
i really liked this place a lot
i am a little scared of indian food
because not sure exactly what i am ordering
the waiter was really nice and explained everything
without being sarcastic
we ordered a couple of things
that was good
but next time
their medium will defintely not be okay
very hot for me
i think mild next time is the key
i love spicy food but am used to the asian spicy so this was a little much for me
i will pass on the app platter too
and go straight for the samosas
which were so good
the only thing that kinda sucked for me that it closed between lunch and dinner for a couple hours
whats up with that
aren't we still a hour town
lunch and dinner hours
what is that
oh and excellent mango lassies
tried their_lunch_buffet today and thought it was pretty good
the upside
they have a variety_of_dishes and choices for vegetarians
yellow dal
they had a name for this dish but i forgot
it was yellow lentils and squash with tamarind and spices
really really yummy
i had helpings
palak_paneer spinach and cottage_cheese very good
its a bit spicy though
i love spicy food and found it a little extra_spicy
potato and peas good
chana_masala good but very oily
bhindi was ok
i make bhindi better
pakora i had one and thought it was too much oil
tasted ok
they had a couple of more vegetarian_dishes
i think in all
and chicken lamb dishes and rice that i did not try
was told that they were quite good
i also tried the mango_chutney and coriander chutney which tasted great
they had several more condiments available
the raita yogurt with cucumber tasted good too
the server brought water and asked us what kind of naan we wanted
unfortunately they did not have tandoori roti which is a healthier bread but who am i kidding
there's nothing healthy about the meal
well
with the exception of the salad
spinach and yogurt i guess
we got naan and it was good
it had a generous helping of butter so we requested one without and he brought it out quickly
the naan was crisp
fresh and tasted amazing
the restaurant was quite busy but the server did a good job keeping our glasses filled with water and asking if we needed anything else
its definitely one of the better indian meals i've had here in vegas
i enjoyed the food here and the servers were very nice
we had the chicken_tiki_masala and lamb_vindaloo
both were good
the naan with the onions were delicious but the onion bhajis was not that great
i'd go back because it's local
nothing really wowed me
personally
it's the best_indian_food_i_have_ever experienced
my friend
whom i dined with lived in london when she was younger and enjoyed a lot of fantastic indian food while she was there
she also quite enjoyed it
we had veggie_samosa
and chile naan with chicken_tikka_marsala
the staff was really accommodating and were very helpful
i will say that we ordered medium heat and it was almost too hot at times
we agreed to level heat
loved it but will probably go with or next time
lol
anyhow
we will be back for the lunch buffet
after a fabulous experience at another indian_buffet_in_town
my sister and i were very excited_to_try this place
it is located next to one of our fave thai places close to our house
d we were not disappointed
we came a half an_hour before the lunch buffet ended
i recommend getting there a bit earlier because they seriously start to remove food at three on the dot
the naan was fresh and delicious
the sweet_rice was yummy and the tikka masala was to die for
i could just eat the sauce on rice and live happily ever after
wonderful cucumber yogurt_sauce and i don't know what kind of crack they put into the rice_pudding with slivered nuts but it was addictive
i wanted to take the steam tray full and run out of the door
good service besides feeling rushed to finish when it hit three
and we will definitely go here again
i got the mixed_grill
the lamb and shrimp were overcooked and dry
but everything else was very good
the fact that there are no other good indian_restaurants in henderson green valley makes this an easy choice to return
the service was very good
the prices were fair
and overall
the food was delicious
seven days a week
taj_palace has a lunch buffet for
located in the the shopping_center on eastern and richmar
this new indian restaurant is rich in decor and cuisine
the hand painted tapestry style wall mural
lantern style light fixtures
and open lighting gives a bright look that most indian places lack
the service was the best i have had in a long time
as we sat ourselves
the waiter came over to ask what kind of naan we would like and filled our_water_glasses
throughout the meal
our dirty plates never stayed on the table for more than minutes
if even that long
water glasses were promptly refilled at the half way mark as well
the food was consistent
i found that i did not hate anything
but the tandoori_chicken was dry
the garlic_naan is amazing
when brought out
it was piping_hot and topped with a copious amount of garlic
the line had two different kinds of rice
basmati and a vegetable_biryani
they also had somosas that were tasty
the saag
spinach
here was delicious
but did not have the paneer
handmade cheese
the other non meat dish i really liked was the veggies in the yellow curry
for those who love their meat
do not fret
because taj_palace offer some dishes for the carnivores as well
the chicken_tikka_masala was creamy and possessed a deep
rich flavor
the goat_curry was tender and not gamey
do not forget to get a bowl of the kheer
rice_pudding
before leaving
taj palace's version is not too sweet and has cashews for a nice crunch
it was the perfect end to a great meal
i have to admit i was hesitant to try indian food with their bold spices and rich flavors but now i could kick myself for waiting sooo long
this is now my second trip to taj_palace for their_lunch_buffet and i'm in love
all their dishes are rich in flavor and oh so good
i have not tried any other places_in_town so i have nothing to compare to but at this rate who cares
i love having them so close to my house
my first visit there i fell in love with a carrot pudding with it's sweet texture and shredded bits of carrot
it is perfection on my spoon
so i was disappointed that they didn't have it out this time when i came in since i had been craving it for weeks
when the waiter came by to see how our meals were i sadly told_him how much i loved their carrot dish and how much i'd been craving it
he smiled and said yes it is good isn't it and walked away
after devouring all their other yummy vegetarian_dishes plus the oh so scrumptious
piping_hot naan_bread
i almost choked back my mouth of food in surprise to see the waiter carrying out a bowl full of my carrot dish to the table
i couldn't believe how awesome and attentive he was
that's what i call service
d at that point i had already overeaten and could not take more than bites so i kindly asked for a take home box ashamed to waste such perfection
i'm glad my taste_buds have finally matured to try the wonderful new cultural flavors i've introduced them too
lol
i can't_wait_to_go_back and i recommend_this_place to everyone i know
i had high hopes taj_palace but should have known that this place is destined to be another flop in the bucket of sub par indian_restaurants in las_vegas
my family and i had dinner here last_night
we ordered several different naans
rotis
and kulchas
the naans were undercooked and you could pull at the doughy centers
the rotis were too thick and you couldn't tell them apart from the naan
we ordered chicken kadai and butter_chicken
both dishes are rich but the oil floating on top of the chicken kadai was just gross
the chicken pieces in the murgh makani
butter_chicken
were strange bits with tiny bones
i was hoping for good quality white chicken_breast
we also ordered a shrimp dish but all you could taste was the tomato base
it lacked the spicy kick we were looking_forward to
on_the_other_hand
the servers were very polite and friendly
the ambiance could use improvement
i'm all about energy efficient lighting
but the white lights gave the place a cafeteria like feel
how much longer do we have to wait before we can get the quality indian food of cities like chicago
ny and la
we are so thrilled to have excellent indian food so close_to_home
i can't believe we didn't try it sooner
we loved the menu with all the many items not found in every indian restaurant
i love hot
spicy vindaloo sauce
which was cooked_to_perfection in their lamb_vindaloo
my husband had the lamb madras
not quite so hot
also cooked_to_perfection
the accompaniments of basmati_rice and naan_bread
along with delicious mango_chutney and cool
refreshing cucumber raita more than our expectations
the service was great and the ambiance as well
the best part was
we had leftovers for lunch_the_next_day
next we will try their_lunch_buffet
we will highly_recommend it to all lovers of indian_cuisine as well as novices who want to try something to really treat their palate
especially lovers of spicy
hot food
like myself
their offer of dine in and carry_out
as well as catering makes it complete
excellent indian restaurant
food was really good
and so was the service and atmosphere
i love that you could choose the spicy level from to
i mean it's indian food so that's a major factor
i went with on the spicy scale and it was deliciously spicy
i highly_recommend trying this place
i was really hesitant reviewing an indian restaurant
since living in lv for years i had pretty much resigned myself to the idea that indian_restaurants were just mediocre
taj_palace completely changed my idea and i think it's the best place for real
i
e
not covered in oil and cream
indian food
my hubby and i have been here a few times
and even brought other friends out here who loved it
firstly
the food is really fresh which is important
the pieces of meat they serve are big cubes
the flavors are bold and remind me of how my family cooks
we've tried their_lunch_buffet which has a really big variety of veg and non_veg food
i love that they bring fresh naan to your table
i have to say that we tried their veg samosa and it was one of the best we've ever had
crispy on the outside and piping_hot on the inside
i think i even dreamed about their mango_lassi
it's so good
we've tried a variety of their chicken dishes and while they do an amazing murgh makani
butter_chicken
last_night we tried their chicken kadai
chicken with green peppers and onions
and my hubby loved it
i was craving aloo parantha
a bread stuffed with potatoes and peas
and saag_paneer
spinach and cheese cubes
and it blew me away
in fact
the food is even better the next day
the service is amazing
and everyone is really nice
they remember us from previous visits and that makes it more special when we eat there
unlike other indian_restaurants where we've waited minutes to even get water
here they serve you drinks immediately
also
i would give them an extra star because they are one of the few indian places that serve ras malai which is hands_down my favorite dessert in the world
and it was soft and perfect and delicious
i didn't even share it
all in all
we'll be regulars here for a long time
great service
very flavorful
authentic
of course
yummy dishes
huge menu
i'll be trying the lunch buffet as soon as i'm in that area of town during noon
happy to give taj five_stars
decided to try this place due to a restaurant
com gift_certificate and we are completely glad_we_did
we ordered the tandoori jhinga
shrimp
chicken_tikka_masala
one regular naan
one garlic_naan
and a mango_lassi
everything was great
chicken_tikka_masala was spiced just right
i think we could've handled a bit more spiciness
and shrimp tandoori was yummy
garlic_naan was a bit overcooked so we ordered a regular naan
which was just right
the restaurant itself is in a great location
spacious
with nice ambience
overall
i'm glad there's an indian restaurant in the silverado area definitely worth a repeat visit
best curry i've had in a really long time
i actually had a sit_down dinner here as i'm not much for buffets
it's a little pricey
but worth_every_penny
we had a tikka masala
lamb rojan josh
and the mattar_paneer
each dish was cooked_to_perfection and had its own flavor profile
like it's supposed to
so many curry_houses seem to have a one size fits all base sauce
which ruins the food
thankfully
this is not the case at taj
the portions were generous in both size and with meat content
though it was a little at the high end for a curry_house
i do feel as though i got my money's worth
they are still waiting on their booze license
so at this time
no beer or wine yet
i can't_wait_to_go_back and try some more of their yummy curries
good selection for the lunch buffet
garlic_naan was made fresh and the taste was very good
great value for lunch
a palace indeed
had the pleasure of having a late dinner and had my reservations as i walked into a nearly empty dining_room
our waiter was awesome and was extremely welcoming
not too familiar with this type of cuisine so i relied heavily on recommendations
unfortunately i can't remember what i ordered
but i do remember enjoying it thoroughly
i even requested nd's to take home for lunch_the_next_day
stop by and give it a go
was a little skeptical because my family and i have eaten at quite a few indian_restaurants_in_town and there have only been a couple that have passed the test
taj_palace is definitely another indian restaurant that we will be frequenting in las_vegas
this place just reopened with new management and is absolutely_amazing
the owner is very active and makes sure you are enjoying your meal
the food was spiced great and the service was awesome
this is definitely a place you could get into a habit of going
we will be backs asap
it's an ok
indian restaurant
only reasons why its getting all the positive_reviews is because its the only one in henderson
specially on eastern
i had their_lunch_buffet which was so so
curries were cold and sort of tasteless
they were running low on food at the buffet and the rice was abysmal
how do you screw up rice
the best thing about this place is their garlic_naan
i think its the freshsest naan i ever had at a buffet
there are better restaurants_in_vegas
if you want good food
then go to namaste or mint_indian_bistro
the friendly wait_staff is here to please knowledgeable indian food eaters
complex flavors on traditional_indian dishes will treat you right
check_this_place_out
recommendations
anything tikka masala
garlic_naan and the sagg paneer
cheers
last_night
in his work induced coma on his only night off in ages
my husband mumbled something about dinner
what are you hungry for
what have we not eaten in ages
and then he answered his own question indian
i remembered seeing positive_reviews of a place on eastern and found it on my yelp app
so off we went
we entered with a bit of hesitation as the restaurant was empty with the exception of two diners
after waiting for what seemed forever
he acknowledged us and invited us to be seated
i recognized him
but couldn't place his face
maybe it was because he handed us menus while talking on a cordless phone and giving the other customers their check
multi tasking
not good for an initial restaurant impression
the husband began to eyeroll me
but he became more forgiving as the server helped him through the enormous menu and we
as usual
overordered
vegetable_samosas
chili pakoras
tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
mango chicken
shrimp tikka
dal
saag with potatoes
zeera rice
raita
chili garlic_naan
not to mention the complimentary pappadums and chutneys and chilis
stop it
yes
enough food for days
my concerns that this would be steam table fare were put to rest once things began to arrive on the table
favorite dishes
the vegetable_samosas were incredibly flavorful and delicious
mango chicken
even better than the tikka
the two vegetable dishes
yellow lentils and the spinach were very satisfying
the rice simple and delicious
and the garlic chili naan was spectacular
particularly with the raita
all in all a very good meal
oh
and the server
it's jignesh
the former manager server of sai india curry our favorite little chaat house near unlv that zipped up unceremoniously a while back
beer
domestic only for now
and wine available
it's a simple
lovely space with good food and kind service
and the owner is definitely yelp savvy he encouraged us a to write a yelp review as he bid us adieu
lunch buffet is great the only thing that would make it perfect is if they served aloo_gobi
chutneys are fresh and delicious
haven't been there for dinner yet
but we definitely will
staff is super_nice
service is excellent
great location
we used to love india_palace
but hated to have to drive into the hood
if you like indian food
you'll love_this_place
this recently opened indian restaurant was not very busy on the monday evening of our visit
we recived complimentary papadum with a spicy mint sauce and the worst tamarind_sauce i have ever encountered
our entrees were boti kabob masala
lamb chunks in a rich yellow curry
and murgh madras
boneless chicken in a tomato cream curry
in addition
we ordered naan and zeera rice
lightly spiced basmati_rice with cumin seeds
neither entr_e scaled any culinary heights though the amount of animal protein in each would likely have caused hannibal lechter to rejoice
i felt menu prices
separate charge for plain rice
were on the high side
do i like indian food
yes
i like lots of flavor
being from louisiana
i have had indian food with some indian friends of mine and i didn't have the heart to tell them they can't cook because i thought that's what indian food must be like
taj_palace had all the flavor i craved in every dish i ate
lamb samosa
goat_curry
lamb kadai
too good
and the dish that stood_out as interesting and fun was mango chicken curry
i will be ordering that one again
taj_palace is located in an upscale strip_mall and had been one of our go to places for indian food
their_lunch_buffet is
and one of the better values in town
their space has a bright and comfortable ambience
they offer a wide_selection_of vegetarian and meat dishes
some of which you don't typically see at other indian_buffets
i do wish they offered butter_chicken instead of chicken_tikka_masala because dark meat is more tender and tasty than white_meat
they also include unlimited
fresh baked plain or garlic_naan with your lunch
for dessert
they usually offer kheer
rice_pudding
and sometimes they also have halva
actually
this is the first place i ever tried halva
and it was delicious
service is friendly and generally efficient
on our last visit
i was disappointed by how they handled an incident where i discovered that i was chewing on a small strip of plastic imbedded in their curry
the staff initially denied it was plastic and said it was vegetable fiber
once it became evident that it was indeed a piece of plastic
he said omg
grabbed it and ran back into the kitchen
they never apologized or offered us any dispensation
nor did we ask for any
my husband and i went to taj place
the food was good and tasty
the service was good
we really like it
just noticed a picture of iron mike tyson posing with the owner
so apparently this must be a local favorite of his
i came here awhile back for the lunch buffet and while the selection was fairly extensive
the single item that beckoned me to return was their garlic_naan
served piping_hot straight from the tandoori oven
the aroma is ethereal and it is one of the best i have ever had
if you wait too long
the soft pillowy texture transforms into a stale saltine cracker like consistency so please don't hold anything back and just attack that naan like tyson on holyfield's ear
i try to rate indian_restaurants on their regular menu rather than buffet since there can often be a steep drop off in quality of food although their buffet is somewhere between stars
on my return_visit with a friend for dinner
we ordered the goat vindaloo and the malai_kofta
vegetable balls served in a heavy cream_sauce loaded with spices such as cumin
coriander
and chili
and a side of the chili garlic_naan
the server will ask you to give a number from regarding spice_level
we chose for the vindaloo and for our vegetarian entry
combined with the chili garlic_naan
our tastebuds were on overdrive for most of the meal and in retrospect
i think the garlic_naan is perfect on its own minus the chilis and is plenty of spice to perk up the flavors without constantly reaching for water
the goat in the tangy and hot vindaloo sauce was amazingly tender and very flavorful and was accompanied_by some nice hunks of potato
i actually didn't mind the fact that some of the pieces were still attached to bone since those were some of the best parts
the malai_kofta balls were savory with the vegetable component
slightly sweet in part due to some raisins within the mixture
and the complex sauce was both creamy and spicy providing a beautiful spectrum of flavors
throw in the beautiful interior
nice choice in silverware and plating
and the excellent service
this is a great option for those venturing out to henderson in the mood for something off the beaten path
do take advantage of the off dinner coupon for checking in on yelp and do not leave without partaking in the garlic_naan
i really enjoy this place
its very close to my boyfriends house so we always come here
the chicken_tikka_masala is very good
and the goat_curry is great
the servers are very friendly and treat customers very well
it is worth trying
update
their_lunch_buffet has been getting better and better by the day
we have been going here since they opened
amazing food
generous buffet from salad to vegetarian to chick goat dishes
they also serve free naan with buffet you can even get garlic_naan
fresh out of the oven
the service is always great
we never have to ask for a water or drinks
plenty of parking too
mom got a coupon on the mail and decided_to_give this restaurant a try
we went in there with no expectations
the service was fantastic
everyone was warm and attentive
i ordered chicken tandoori and mom got peas and potatoes in cream_sauce
we ordered naan and rice
we also had delicious vegetarian zomosas
the food took a while which told us it was being cooked when we ordered and not sitting in a warmer
everything was delicious
we are definitely going back for buffet
the restaurant is beautiful
good job taj_palace
this place is great
i had their_lunch_buffet and i went home fully satisfied
we ordered garlic_naan
and got food from the buffet line
chicken_tikka_masala was really good
it was tender and the sauce was delicious
my favorite way to eat naan is to dip it in curry or dipping it in one of the dishes
i devoured three baskets of garlic_naan in no time
their curry was excellent as well
great place to satisfy your indian appetite
im getting hungry just talking_about this place
my wife and i took her brother and his wife to this fine indian restaurant late on a friday_night
luckily they are open until
pm
it was the first time we visited this fairly new restaurant
since my wife's family has never had indian food before
i wanted them to try some of the more tasty
but safe for beginners indian dishes which i will discuss in a minute
we were greeted and seated quickly by warm and friendly people
before we placed our order i asked for some papad to munch on
they brought out several pieces with two different_types_of sauces chutneys that were just delicious
as an appetizer we ordered four vegetable_samosas that were the best i've ever had
i thought i would go out on a limb and ask for one of my favorite indian dishes
that is always off menu the ultra delicious and elusive chicken
our waiter said that he would ask the chef
to my surprise
he returned with a yes
however
the chef needs a day in advance to prepare it
definitely returning soon just for that dish alone
in lieu of chicken
the chef recommended chicken kadai
which turned_out_to_be excellent
on a heat scale of
i ordered an and it was perfect
it was flavorful and saucy
in addition
for our main_courses we ordered indian food staples such as biryani
chana_masala
and tandoori_chicken
biryani can be difficult to make correctly especially if you have eaten a lot homemade biryani
it was the perfect complement to the other dishes
the portion was ideal since we were all sharing
the chana_masala very tasty
the garbanzos were cooked_perfectly and over all was very good
we ordered a whole tandoori_chicken which is enough for four people
it was brought to us on a sizzling platter
it was moist and scrumptious
we opted for orders of naan garlic
garlic chili
and plain
perfectly seasoned and made fresh
you just can't eat indian food without naan
i highly_recommend the taj mango shake
they are so good
you will need your own because you won't want to share it
one sip and you're hooked
have it with your meal or as a dessert
either way
it's a must have beverage
i can tell you that i have no need to go anywhere_else for indian food
this is it for me
anywhere_else would only be a gamble
i will_be_returning to try other dishes and of course i will call ahead to try their chicken
since everything else was so good
i know that i won't be disappointed
dont know what the hype is about
nothing special have had alot better indian food
dry chicken_tika
rice tasted like it was a day old
best part was the naan_bread and the cute waiter
close to my house
i think i found a new spot for my indian food pleasure
i had samosa
korma and naan
yummy
i love the blend_of_spices in my korma
the somosa was the biggest i've seen
this is a must return place
oh and a bonus
they have goat
great buffet
this is a vegetarian's haven
i took my vegetarian daughter here and everything was absolutely_delicious
we both had the buffet which came with made to order garlic
you can order it regular too
naan_bread
i love spicy food and this place satisfies that craving
i've been to many indians restaurants in southern nevada and california and i must say this place is in the top three
i ordered the lamb_vindaloo to go at an heat_level
i was warned by owner bobby that it would be very hot and i said i could handle it
i must say he was right
it was a lively treat to the taste_buds but it required some labor to get the heat down
next time i will get it at level
i was very impressed by the portion of the dish
in my experience indian_restaurants are usually chintzy with meat portions
taj_palace is very generous with their fare
i will be a frequent patron
great food
i really loved their curry chicken and tikki chicken masala and the fresh naan they serve to you in the beginning
soo good and soo fresh
i went to their_lunch_buffet for the first time yesterday
a lot of selection to choose from and it is all very worth the price
i brought my sleeping mos
year_old along with me
i had no idea she was going to wake up so suddenly and was crying the moment i would get up and get myself a fresh new plate of food
the very nice gentleman waiter that was there was so kind to go out of his way to help cheer my daughter up when she would cry
she was in all smiles afterwards
great place
ambience
music
service
and definitely delicious food
i am going back again very soon
thank you again to the nice gentlemen waiter for making my daughter and i's first time experience at the restaurant so wonderful
really great food flavor
spice
everything
at first i was unsure about the price
but the value is great
a ton of food
enough to share and for leftovers
everyone that worked there was so nice and courteous
we'll_definitely_be_back
we were so happy to find this restaurant
there is a pride of ownership here
and the food is made with love
the food is so good
and they offer more nan
refill your glass_of_water
are always polite and welcoming
the best thing is the tikka massala
it is not the watered_down stuff like the mint_indian_bistro
although we like to go there too sometimes
the food here is serious and if you like it spicy
you got it
lunch buffet is
and worth_every_penny
just take a small sample of everything on the buffet line
and you will leave with a smile
one time they had samosas
and they were also great
they don't always have that though
enjoy
don't forget to leave a little tip ha ha
great lunch buffet
beautiful and relaxing setting
nice waiters
friendly
with good service
great service and great food
loved it
as a long time orange county kid and the son of indian immigrants
i have a pretty good understanding of quality south_asian cuisine
i've eaten a lot of it from restaurants and i've had it countless times in home_cooked meals
trust_me then
when i say that this place is really just ok
it's well decorated
and the service was alright
we came here for a lunch buffet one time
i did find the garlic_naan to be pretty tasty
but in the realm of indian_cuisine
this establishment hardly impresses
its hard for me to put into words exactly
but the flavor
texture
and quality of the ingredients were simply below what i expect from an indian place
some of the curries were a bit bland
i wasn't particularly impressed by their chicken_tikka
the lentils here are are a bit overcooked
and again
just not that good
don't_get_me_wrong its passable and worth trying
i think its a good place to go to for lunch indian food isn't something most people eat everyday
but if you want quality south_asian food
there are much better places
even here in vegas
try the hole_in_the_wall kabob corner in fremont
it may not look impressive but their food tastes much fresher and is much better seasoned
my husband and i stopped here for lunch and it was fantastic
we are normally a little skeptical of buffets but the food was all very fresh and hot
plus there was a lot of selection
the place has a nice decor and a nice smell aside from the food
there was an underlying spicy incense smell
the price was just a little higher_than the standard lunch buffet but it was definitely worth it due to higher quality
the service was good
our_water_glasses were never empty and the server checked on us repeatedly to make sure everything was to our liking
i would definitely recommend
food was good
its close to my house and i had a groupon so decided to try since i love indian food
service was good
saw that they offer a lunch buffet so may have to come back and try sometime
was looking for an indian restaurant for dinner in the henderson area
and taj_palace has
so i figured why not
i had the chicken_tikki_masala
and my date had the paneer tikkia masala
we also had a side of rice and an indian beer
even with the yelp discount
the bill came out to after tax
while the food was definitely good
as was the service
that just seems like a lot of money for what we ordered
every other indian restaurant i've been to in town is cheaper
and even more so when i use a restaurant
com certificate
love the food
recommend chicken_tika_masala
you can't_go_wrong with this one in any indian restaurant
want to try lunch buffet sometime
being such an unoriginal foodie i have been working on branching out to different_types_of cuisine
indian food was on the must try list for me
admittedly my very first indian food dining_experience was some time last year and i failed to yelp about it insert hand slap here
but that only means i will have to revisit the eatery
drumming up repeat business
and yelp about it then
back to taj_palace
yum
last_night was my second time dining here and it was equally as delightful as the first time
excellent service
not a glass gone empty all night
food seasoned to perfection and plenty of left_overs to enjoy today
my only gripe menu item gripes were regarding the appetizers
paneer_pakora and the fish pakora
both were extremely dry and virtually flavorless
all in all
stellar service
the place is rarely packed
delicious eats
if you steer clear of the fried appetizers
distinguishable meats
white_meat chicken used
yey
and delicious flavors will have me and my friends coming_back for more
this was my first foray into indian food and i found it using yelp
the staff was friendly_and_helpful
explaining what each item was on the buffet
i tried a taste of everything and found the chicken_tikka_masala and chicken tandoori amazing
i scooped it up with delicious garlic_naan
i usually love curry
but didn't care for the goat_curry
nor did i like the vegetarian_dishes with spinich or lentils
i chk'd the menu prices as well and the buffet is an excellent deal
i'll be going back there soon
our fave place
service superb
food delicious
reasonable_price
deliciousness
great food
i love the chef
he's awesome
delicious
got the chicken saag and paneer masala
great portions for decent prices
each
very friendly_and_attentive staff
they check the spice_level with the appetizer chutney so you know what you're getting
will_be_coming_back on my next trip_to_vegas
i like indian food on the spicier side
and they got it just right
their saag has a pasty
airy texture
overall
quality buffet
place was soo yummy
went with a party of people and we all ordered something different and shared and we liked everything
not the worst indian restaurant in las_vegas
but absolutely not deserving of a
yelp rating
when we visited the buffet was uninspired
featured no paneer option
and was severely lacking in spice and overall layers of flavour
it felt geared toward middle america's palate rather than those of expats from the sub continent and those of us with a bit of experience in the true heavenly flavours of the region
give me a good curry and some tasty naan to mop up the sauce and i am happy
sadly
taj_palace presented my usual go to dish
the chicken_tikka_masala
as a disappointinging bland
rather sweet
and lacking any real zest and the naan was almost tasteless
the food looked ok
but this is the sort of indian a grandparent would eat
i'll stick to mint or mt_everest
i dont go anywhere_else for indian food in vegas after finding this place
staff is very attentive and polite which is nice
sometimes i go in on a slow night with my year_old for mommy son dinner dates and the place is empty so i dont feel like he is bothering anyone
plates are def big enough for
decor inside is beautiful
date worthy
i always get the murgh madras combo
i have had it spicy and non spicy by accident when they forgot to ask
i have to admit spice is key when it comes to flavor here but the meat is always very well cooked
must go spicy
i ate at this place about two years_ago with a friend who was a curry fiend
i remembered the meal i had was pretty good
so when we got some coupons in the mail the wife and i decided to go again
i'm in no way or form an_expert_on_indian food as i've always enjoyed the east asian curries more
so the wife and i played it safe and went with a full order of tandoori murgh shahnaz
marinated baked chicken on the bone
and jhinga tikka masala
prawns with onion and peppers in a tomato cream_sauce
on the side was garlic_naan and white rice
the chicken
being thighs and legs
was as good as i remembered
served a sizzling cast iron plate on a bed of onions and peppers
they managed to render out most of the fat while cooking
thanks to the clay_oven
but managed to keep all of the flavor
the prawn dish was delicious
but for i would expect more prawns or at least bigger ones
the highlight of the dish was the tomato cream_sauce that found it's way on top of my chicken rapped in naan
the service was quick
attentive
and funny
when i ordered both dished with the rice naan combo add on for the waiter suggested just a double order of naan and a single order of rice
that kind of customer_service is very highly appreciated
when it came time to go we had some left_overs that definitely earned a trip home with us
i appreciate it when a restaurant gives you decent to go containers and these_guys didn't attempt to have us shove everything in one big styrofoam container but gave_us smaller ones for each component of the meal
perhaps a silly thing to comment on
but i like it when my left_overs look just as good as the day i ordered them
is this an
authentic indian
restaurant
damned if i know
but since the staff is indian and very friendly i imagine if you flexed your knowledge they'll be accommodating
a narrow menu selection
but good quality
i only recently realized that they charge for rice
at dinner
which i thought strange
as badly as i want to try new indian_restaurants_in_town
i always end up leaving utterly disappointed and regretting my decision for not just going to mint
my never fails me staple
taj_palace was no exception
things had started off well with a nice interior and friendly service
but then everything started to go downhill from there with a total blowup to end our meal
food took much too long to come out
free papadums were nice
but the tamarind and mint chutneys tasted old
the garlic_naan had no traceable amounts of garlic
plus it was super crunchy and almost burnt
for a bowl of plain rice
the aloo_gobi
or gobi aloo as they call it
was completely flavorless
at an indian restaurant
it was just boiled potatoes
cauliflower
and tomatoes sitting in some liquid
not edible
i will give credit where credit is due and say that the paneer tiki_masala was very good
it was flavorful and had a generous portion of paneer
the kicker was at the end when we went to pay for our meal and we were told they wouldn't accept our coupon
it would have been one thing if there was a sign posted on the door stating this or if we hadn't shown the servers the coupon until the end of our meal
however
there is no sign saying they don't accept coupons and we had the coupon out at the edge of the table from the minute we sat_down
four servers never once said anything about it before we ordered
despite the fact that i saw all of them look at it
i'm tired of restaurants offering coupons and then deciding they don't feel like it anymore and won't make good on the ones that are still out there
but to wait until after we are done eating to tell us
when you know that we have a coupon waiting
is shady to me
it's times like these i wish my mom didn't raise me to be polite and just walk away from the situation
the paneer was their saving grace that brought them up to two stars
just went here for the first time earlier this evening
based_on yelp_reviews
excellent food and service
staff was very attentive and friendly
food was awesome
i was in the east_side of the town and trying to find a indian restaurant that closer to me to get the lunch
i was looking at the yelp and tried this place for the comments they had
i was happy with their interior decoration and the guy who was water is kind and pleasant to make the place likable
food is little spicier and its perfect to my taste and thandor chicken was over painted with the red color
i think they use lots of food colors and they might have to reduce that to make people less curiosity
mango_lassi was perfect and dosa taste was great
i will definetley go back and will recommend to anyone
great indian buffet
they have a great selection for vegetarians
such as myself
and also some meat dishes for those who choose to eat meat
vick is a great server
he will take care of you asap
check it out
the good
of all the indian_restaurants_in_town
taj_palace is one of the best
their dinner menu is so distinctive and it stands_out of all the menus in town
their food is rich in flavor
content
and taste
this might be sneaky
but i got a good look at their kitchen when i was walking to use washroom their kitchen is huge and from all that i've seen
it is spotless clean
that showed in the quality of their food and its taste
service was good
the bad
nothing
nada
if you insist
i still don't have anything
bottom_line
if you live in las_vegas and you are craving indian
this is the place i recommend you go
i will go back there soon to try out their_lunch_buffet
we were craving_indian_food but didn't feel like driving so we stopped by this place
we had their_lunch_buffet before but wasn't overly impressed
we figured the dinner would be better
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala with spiciness out of and it was pretty hot
they used white_meat but some pieces were very dry and some were moist
she ordered a combination plate
coming from ny and boston indian food always comes with rice but they charge you here
we also ordered a nan and roti which was pretty good
this place wasn't horrible but i probably won't go back to this location and would probably drive a little further for better indian food
just short and sweet to let others know
this place is wonderful in every way
best_indian_food_i_have_ever had and best service and low prices
best of all
they do not have a liquor licence but encourage you to bring_your_own wine or beer and they will open for you
no charge
i had wanted to go to this place for a long time because my husband and i are vegan
and my daughter and hter boyfriend eat every kind of food out there
so we finally went all together and it was awesome
the flavors were out_of_this_world
we could not stop_eating
the service was wonderful and the servers were kind and funny
we had all vegetable dishes and the kids had fish and lamb
the dining_area was lavishly decorated and could be a very romantic dinner spot
the only suggestion i could make was to turn the air conditioning up
especially with all of the spicy food
let me be straight
i love indian food
what's better than sopping up all that extra sauce with tender naan_bread
you really can't_go_wrong
we haven't had the pleasure of a indian restaurant close_to_home
so when a friend of our invited us to taj_palace for dinner it was a no brainer
the decor is subtly lit
and classic indian culture
pretty much what i would expect walking into an indian restaurant
i was quite excited_to_see the discount for check in on yelp
the screams
smart
business to me
our server's name was vick and he was a class act
he made some really amazing recommendations
the most unexpected and easily most refreshing was a yogurt based mango drink
non alcoholic
if you don't do alcohol this is a must
it was subtly sweet
enchancing the earthy flavor of the mango while wrapping you up in all that yogurt creaminess
i don't even like mango and i was in love
the wine_list was pretty limited
but i can't say i was expecting a cellar list to be presented
the pinot noir i ordered was pleasing
but pinot's a typically easy drinking wines
we started with a lamb samosa chili paneer
both were presented quickly
and were delicious
i wish that i could remember
pronounce or even spell some of the indian names of the dishes we ate
but alas
i cannot
i know
lame
i had the non_veg combo platter
it included chicken_tikka_masala butter_chicken chicken curry dal riata naan rice rice_pudding
i went with a level on my food
i like the spice
but want to taste the flavor
my husband tried the shrimp_curry at a level
the butter_chicken at taj_palace is nothing short of incredible
don't_get_me_wrong
everything was delicious
and i have few complaints
as i write this review however
my palette is overcome with the savory lingering of the butter_chicken sauce
yum
vick
our server
actually had the chef make me an additional portion to take home for naan dipping
what an awesome guy
he's an a in my book
my husband's dish was spicy
and rightfully so it was a
the shrimp was perfectly_cooked and saucy
my_only_complaint was that his garlic_naan was quite burnt around the edges
this was disappointing
as i had read many reviews about how great the garlic_naan was
oh well
maybe next time
and that's where i'll leave you my yelp friends
there will indeed be a next time
taj_palace was delicious
the atmosphere was comfortable and classy
the service was on point and attentive
give taj_palace a try
your tummy will thank you
i took my dad here for an early father's day lunch
the friday before father's day
bad choice when your father is indian
the ambiance and decor was very nice
and the service was good
considering how busy they were
now on to the good stuff
well the not so good stuff in this case
the food
we frequented the restaurant during the afternoon
during the lunch buffet
i was excited_to_try somewhere new and the reviews about this place were great
as soon as i approached the buffet
i could see that the vegetables were soaked in oil
i was mortified
i'm not the healthiest person
but i could not knowingly eat such oily indian food
especially when i cook it myself and i know it does not require that much oil
my dad had the buffet
and was not very pleased
i ordered malai_kofta and dal_makhani off of the menu
the malai_kofta was not good
i took it home and threw it away
and i was raised to never waste food
the naan was ok
nothing_to_write_home_about
the plus side to this adventure was the dal_makhani
it was really tasty
most indian_restaurants in vegas are not cheap
and this place is no exception
i don't mind paying for quality when i receive it
but i did not receive it here
i will not be back
my hibernation from yelp ends with this review for taj_palace
i've been to taj on several occasions and have always received perfect service
i seriously think that they have the best naan here in town
everything else is debatable
but for some reason their naan takes the cake in my eyes
of course
indian food is always amazin for vegetarian_options which is what keeps me coming_back
when i asked for a on the spicy scale
it was exactly what i was asking for
everytime
they question whether i truly wish to receive a
i always assure them that i'm thai and can handle the heat
usually that's enough anecdotal evidence to prove that i am a true chili head
i believe i ordered the tikka masala this time around and i really have no complaints
for the drink
i got the mango yogurt drink
can't remember the exact name
for dessert
rice_pudding
the server highly_recommended that i have the ice_cream in place of it because he thought it was way better
i declined only because it was freezing cold in this place
otherwise
i would have taken up his offer
since this place is conveniently located next to my house
i will be here more often when i'm craving delicious naan
we decided to try this place for the lunch buffet
and it was alright for
before tax and gratuity
we opted for the garlic_naan and it was delicious
my_favorite_dish of all time at indian buffet is the goat_curry
there was goat_curry on the line
however
it wasn't flavorful as i would have liked it to be
thank goodness they were tender
the chicken tandoori was kind of dry
the kheer
which is the rice_pudding
wasn't so delicious as the one over at india_palace
i have to say that i enjoy the lunch buffet at india_palace much more
i probably won't be coming_back to taj
i have now eaten here several times and each time the food is gotten better
the manager was very polite and willing to take advice regarding the food and seems to have taken some of my suggestions to heart and continues to make the quality better
the cleanliness of the restaurant is excellent
the buffet is a great value and very well done
i would highly_recommend this indian food restaurant to anyone near the area
peter
i've been coming here since this place was called taza
then jai ho
and now taj_palace
i'm not sure why the name changes but either way the food is always good
i by no means am an indian food expert but my experiences here are always good
the curries are as spicy as you want them
the nan is delicious
i love the garlic_nan
and the tandoori_chicken is always piping_hot and tasty
if you're not familiar_with_indian_food or really hungry
be sure to hit up their_lunch_buffet
there are a lot of choices at a very reasonable_price
the servers are also very helpful as i try to order something new on each visit
also
be sure to keep an eye out in local publications for coupons and specials
wow
my daughter and i were visiting from san diego a couple of weeks_ago and used yelp to locate a good indian restaurant
we were not disappointed
and the service was great thanks vic
all i can say is yum yum_yum
this place was okay
my fiance and i were seriously craving_indian_food
and this place was near our house
the portions are good
you get a good amount of food for what you pay for
we shared the chicken_tikka_masala
it looked yummy
the first bite was really good
but as i kept eating i noticed some pieces of chicken tasted old
the naan was good but nothing special
honestly
i would not return here again
i've had better indian food for cheaper
been wanting_to_try taj_palace for a while since it's the closest indian restaurant to my house and i'm obsessed with both samosa_factory and mt_everest from my work lunch breaks
even though it averages stars here on yelp
there was always something about the reviews that made me a little tentative
well
that and the non buffet prices
what is it about indian_restaurants and their dinner prices
they always seem about more expensive per entree than i expect
compared to most of their_lunch_buffet or lunch_special bargains
it drives me a little crazy to go to one for dinner and get much less food for a lot more money
this type of thinking is why my pants i just picked_up from men's wearhouse barely fit
but i digress
i ordered the veggie_samosas which is one of my standards i judge any indian restaurant on
some plain_naan
and goat_curry spicy out of
love this scale
i asked if the curry came with rice
and i was told no
but that i could do a combo of rice and naan
sure
sounds like exactly what i need
when i arrived
my total bill was
now the curry was and the samosas were
according to their_website
so i guess the naan and rice cost or so
shrug
started with the curry over the rice first
the curry had a nice flavor
it was thick
smoky
and the spice_level was perfect
on top of the rice or being sopped up with the naan
the naan was about what i expect
which is a good thing
either way made me happy
the goat was tasty
but there were a lot of bones and pieces of fat and cartilage throughout which was a bit of a buzzkill
it was rare to be able to get a bite of meat without having to constantly spit out a small chunk of something
best visual ever
i know
i actually would have ultimately preferred it with just the curry_sauce by the end of my plate
the samosas were very large and perfectly shaped with a great flaky crust
honestly it almost seemed a little too perfectly made which had me wondering if it was homemade or not
i have no way of knowing honestly
it's quite possible it is
they tasted fine on the inside
but i found the outside to be overly salt or peppered or both
i'd honestly never had a samosa with so much seasoning on the outside of it
and my fingers were covered in spice whenever i'd pick_it_up to eat it which i wasn't used to
the green sauce it came with was good
wasn't so much a fan of the red
overall a good version
though i prefer factory's or mt everest's
final conclusion is that i enjoyed my meal overall
though i wouldn't exactly say it was worth the price i paid in total
i did get leftovers out of it which softened the blow a little
i think i'll stick with samosa_factory and mt_everest to satisfy my indian cravings
though if i'm ever in a dire need for some curry in henderson
it happens
it definitely happens
taj_palace warrants some consideration
my husband i enjoyed dinner at taj_palace on a monday night
the service_was_prompt the food was excellent
some of the best food we've had in vegas actually
the prices are very fair considering how rich in flavor all the dishes are
the garlic_naan is to die for as well as the coconut chicken curry
yumm
this place will be visited again very soon
pretty solid indian food definitely the best place on this side of town
definitely worth trying
as far as indian food goes
taj_palace is delicious
as far as service
our waiter vimal treated us like queens
it's the typical strip_mall exterior
like almost all restaurants in henderson
nv
coming from los angeles
i'm starting to get used to great restaurants like this after all
many wonderful treasures can be found in strip_mall style buildings in la
when we were seated around
pm
the entire restaurant was empty
so there was no wait
vimal brought out papadum
indian bread
crispy and very thin like a cracker
with hot green sauce and a tasty plum sauce
we ordered veggie_samosas to start
which seemed to be hand made at the restaurant and were spectacular
vimal convinced us to try nasi biryani rice instead of the traditional white basmati_rice i normally order
it's like an indian fried_rice
with golden raisins and almonds that has a yellow coloring from the spices
delicious
that came out with our chicken_tikka_masala in medium spiciness and our garlic_naan
every dish was better than the last
at this point a middle aged couple came into the nicely_decorated restaurant and sat_down to dinner as well
i think it's surprising that the place was so empty
considering how yummy everything was
the other couple verbally recognized this and asked vimal about it as well
it seems new ownership took over more than a year_ago
and he just needs to get the word out
so here's the word we'll be stopping by again soon to check out the buffet for lunch
that seems like a great value
we love coming here
we uaually come at least time per month
the staff is always friendly
the place is very clean
and the food is spicey
we love the garlic_naan and the tikka masala
we have tried all the indian_restaurants in the vegas area
and none come close
price is about
and worth_every_penny
i really like the garlic_nan
we actually ate at the lunch buffet
which is definately worth the price
i couldn't tell you what to order but we had some kind of mixed_vegetable dish that was really good
i loved this place so much
and not just because the food was great it was the service and recommendations we received from the staff
one of whom i was pretty sure was the owner
were enough to give stars
i had ordered a restaurant
com_coupon back in march for this place and forgot about it
so when one of my friends was in town and we were craving_indian_food
we of course had to stop
i ordered mango curry chicken and my friend had lamb jalfrezi
and of course we added naan and rice to our order
the rice was a recommendation of the server's one i had never had with peas
white raisins
and nuts
it was quite good
and went well with what we ordered
but i am going to stick to rice without all the extras next time
it was pricey to have that much extra stuff in it when i just want some straight up plain rice
the mango chicken was pretty much sweetened butter_chicken
but it was delicious
the lamb was a little tough for my liking
but luckily that wasn't my dish
ha ha
sucks to be my friend
but it was minty and delicious and had a nice flavor but was a workout for the teeth
we went a little overboard our restaurant
com_coupon and ended_up spending another apiece
that's the danger in those things you think you're not going to be above the limit and then there you are
paying for stuff you didn't really need
beer
that i will say was good
just not perhaps something i needed to complete the meal
i will_definitely_be_back i want to try their buffet as well as their lunch
it was a good dining_experience overall
with minor details not upsetting my star experience
now
i love indian food and basically will order it every where i travel to because i always get a craving for it
i had been thinking about taj_palace for some time now and finally got the family to try it out
a
ambiance strip_mall setting
plenty of seating arrangements and for various size
perhaps you can fit up to about people
so it was decent size
good lighting
nice bar
buffet area
tables and booths
i say star
b
service it was not busy
so we got pretty darn good service from everyone there
although it seemed to take like forever for the food to come out and the natives were getting a bit restless
star
c
food star
a
chicken_tikka_marsala ok
so this is really an english invented indian dish and not popular in india
i get it
just like chop suey and fortune cookies in chinese cooking
these were things invented not in the original country
i get it
but man was this dish uninspired
the chicken was cut in huge cubes
the best way to slice is to take the breasts and cut at angles to get thin against the grain meat that when cooked
produce an aromatic and tender chicken
eating these chunks
was like eating chunks
we asked for out of spice due to the kids and this thing was more spicy than the spice i ordered for the lamb
star
b
lamb bhuna i was a looking for the lamb roghan josh
the spice was mild
perhaps they messed this up with the miles tikka i ordered
the lamb was a bit tough
however the gravy sauce was awesome and quite tasty
i give this a star
great taste
terrible texture
c
garlic_naan kids loved it
we had to order another servicing
star
d
tandoori_chicken hmmm good color
bit dry
on a bed of peppers
very tasty
if not overly cooked
star
to me
a family of four and it cost about
including tip
way too expensive and not enough to warrant a return_visit
star
i just love_this_place
great food and the service is wonderful
you really feel like the staff cares about you
they recommended great food combinations and beer that made our experience better than if we would have just stuck to our normal indian food order
i just moved here but this will be one of my
go to
places
thank you taj_palace
ordered take out the other night
we asked the guy taking the order what their best chicken dish was and he suggested karahi chicken
ended_up ordering karahi chicken
palak_paneer
dal_makhani
naan and roti for our guests
when we brought home the order
we realized they had given us shahi or karahi paneer instead of the chicken
i called back and the guy was apologetic and offered to deliver the chicken to us
since the order had taken over minutes and it was a busy saturday_night
we offered to come and pick_it_up
points for customer_service as they compensated by giving us a complimentary pulao rice
and some achar relish and corrected the order
points for the food however
dal_makhani was extra creamy but tasted the best of the lot
palak_paneer was ok
chicken karahi which they claimed was the best chicken option was flavorless and pretty tasteless
pulao was not bad
pretty decent
naan and roti were well made
they let us keep the paneer karahi as well
but unfortunately that was pretty tasteless too
i usually love leftover food the next day but this i was happy to get rid off
i will try them again as this may have been a freak day since they were busy
but it was disappointing considering our guests were looking_forward to a nice indian meal and price wise the place is not cheap
i guess i will stick to the buffet for this one
as somehow the buffet experience has been ok every time but have not had the same luck with take out orders
amazing goat_curry
masala mushroom
and above all
amazing service
came here fresh off the plane and we were craving_indian_food so we landed on this strip_mall restaurant
i wasnt hungry to begin with but ended_up going with the large lunch buffet
so delicious
they had goat that was tender
the server vigal was very friendly but i felt that he hovered a little too much
some people like that
some dont
service was impeccable though
food was so delicious too
dollar buffet with custard dessert and rice_pudding
reallyyyyy tasty
go
for a lunch buffet priced at
with killer garlic_naan and the best service i have seen at an indian place
this place gets stars automatically
the food
well
it was simply wonderful and amazing and delish and oh so perfect
i came here solo for lunch two days_ago for the first time and found the place to be a hidden_gem
to me
maybe not to others
i'm sure the options might change daily for the buffet
but the first two things i tried were the only two things i ate because they were that good
the lentils with rice and the chicken_tikka_masala can't_go_wrong
for some reason i just wasn't in the mood for lamb
but it looked very good
this place is good and you_can't_beat the lunch buffet price and food
very good indian food
not as spicy as i would like
but the staff offered to give me an extra dose of heat on the side
the chutney tastes so homemade and delicious
will definitely make this place one of my regular dr in places to go
this is one_of_my_favorites places
i dine in or out at least times a week
the lunch buffet is a great deal
look for the coupons that float around in local mags

i wouldn't go thaaaaaaaat far
but they've always been incredibly friendly
attentive and happy to see me
i'm their golden goose
it's not cheap
so don't roll in expecting person
being a vegetarian
which indian culuture is as well
they have an excellent selection of lentils and meat less dishes
my favorite
the yellow dal
a sh t ton of naan and a side of tamrin sauce
delish
my carnivore husband loves the lamb the peas pillau
a yummy rice with peas
raisins nuts
i would give taj stars if it wasn't for the consistency
on a few occasions
i've ordered the usual
gotten it home and it tasted crappy
i've phoned in everytime after and they've apologized and offered to pay for my next order
different chef working that night
overall
love
this is probably one of the best indian places
the service was friendly and fast
we ordered different plates and it was all good
naan are always good
at first there was only tables by the end of the meal there was tables filled
definitely going back there for the lunch buffet soon
i had high hopes for my meal at taj_palace
i read the series of yelp_reviews and even recall a few friends stating it was a good place for curry
i have to presume
it was a bad night for the team at taj_palace
as much as it pains me to write a
negative
review
i have to be true to my experience
we arrived on friday_evening around
pm
the yelp_reviews for taj were higher_than ping kao my intended destination
upon arrival i noticed the large dining_room had a total of three occupied tables
the friendly waiters greeted and seated our party of two promptly
to make a long story bearable i will cut to the chase
i ordered a medium butter_chicken
at
i anticipated a fantastic dish
my partner
ordered a
lamb dish
he will write his own review
to our amazement
the two dishes did not come with naan or rice
we ordered these items on the side
the plain basmati_rice was
and the naan was
the food came out within ten_minutes
have to give an a for speed and service during the pre dinner service
this team was on top of it
there were four servers for our table
our water was never empty and the empty or unused plates utensils disappeared quickly
so on to the food
i will only speak to my own dish
i have had several butter_chicken
murgh makhani
dishes at different places
i am familiar with the expected flavor
this particular dish just did not taste like any butter_chicken
i have had in the past
the color of the dish looked proper but the flavor was off
it almost tasted as if they used mayonnaise instead of cream or yogurt in the dish
it was slimy and did not have a good flavor at all
to supplement the flavor the meat within the dish was chopped into small bits
there were also chunks of bone
fat and bay leaf
it was just awful
some might say
you should have sent it back
i have warded off sending any dishes back at restaurants
there are too many horror stories
i simply did not finish it
the post dinner service left us sitting with dirty dishes for twenty minutes
when the two waiters finally collected the plates they did not ask about our experience and did not notice most of my butter_chicken was still in the dish
i do not expect anyone to read my mind
it had to be a bad night
maybe
i will try again in the future
ok
first a disclaimer
i'm british which may mean i have overly high standards for indian food
that said
i've lived in the us for years
so i feel i know what to expect
my main gripes with this place were the fact it's overpriced
for rice after ordering a lamb_curry
and the fact that the food was bland
the waiter asked how spicy
mild
medium
spicy
and i said medium
when the food game
it looked nice
but there was very little flavor and no spiciness i could detect
it wasn't horrible
but i've enjoyed indian food in mall food courts more than the food at taj_palace
the service started off great
four waiters taking care of the two of us
but we were oddly left for minutes after we'd finished out food with not a waiter in sight
also the booths were rickety
they don't seem to be attached to the walls
so i could feel every time the person behind me moved
it's difficult to describe this annoyance without sounding ridiculously petty
but i spent most of the meal leaning forward at an unnatural angle
i really wanted this place to be good
not least as i'd talked my girlfriend out of her favorite thai place that's in the same strip_mall
a curry and beer on a friday_night
the stuff
englishmen's
dreams are made of
maybe the lunch buffet is great
and that why this place has great reviews
i can't think of any other reason
ive been back here many a time
i am surprised by the buffet at lunch time it is so good
always a winner
great customer_service
try it all you wont be disappointed
finally
a place that rivals anything we've had in surrey
which is a large indo canadian neighbourhood outside vancouver
the mixed tandoori grill is terrific and very low in fat
the lamb_biryani was so tender we barely had to chew
i'm almost sorry we found this place
as all my diet plans are now totally out the window
i've been here a few times and the great food and attentive
friendly service keep me coming_back
i really enjoy their_lunch_buffet
mainly because i have so many favorite dishes that it's difficult to narrow it down and choose one or two things for dinner
their naan_bread is tasty
doughy with a light crisp
the restaurant is clean and has a great ambiance
the decor
from the wall color to the art is beautiful and tastefully done
the staff is warm
inviting and very attentive
ready to clear your plate seemingly as soon as you make the gesture to push your plate to the side
had such a great time at taj_palace
our server vick was a pleasant mixture of cute and charming
we were first timers at indian food
and vick took the time to explain the dishes
an extra detail not gone unnoticed
the food was delicious
so flavorful
all in all
it was a wonderful first experience and we can't_wait_to_go_back
i love_this_place
this is hands_down the best indian restaurant i have ever been to
and i have been to a lot
the buffet is awesome and comes with your choice of traditional or garlic_naan bread
this is a haven for any vegetarian looking to experience great flavor as there are many vegetarian_dishes to choose from
also for non vegetarians you can enjoy the delightful scrumptious chicken dishes prepared by chef jaipal as well as the vegetarian_dishes
if you like goat the buffet includes a wonderful goat_curry
when ordering off the menu i recommend the lamb or chicken_vindaloo or the lamb and chicken haryali
but everything on the menu is delicious
if you try the buffet keep in mind that the heat factor is at a level from
when i order_off_the_menu i like it spicy so i usually go between
also the service is impeccable
every one is friendly and every now and then chef jaipal will come out and say hello
if you love indian food
this is definitely the place to go
it is a well decorated
charming indian restaurant in the middle of a strip_mall on eastern
parking can be a hassle on the weekends for dinner due to it being located next to overly popular and equally overrated bjs
the service is always incredible
the servers are friendly
accommodating and extremely willing to make suggestions to get you out of the
chicken_tikka_masala
comfort zone
for dinner
boyfriend had spicy vindalo
which is chicken cooked with potatoes
spices
and vindaloo sauce which is the red variety of sauce
it was not very spicy as i believe they modified it due to fear of us not being able to handle the heat
i love my food spicy
the dish was good
nevertheless
i had the spicy haryali
which was chicken cooked in spicy green sauce made with onion
spinach
mint
cilantro and green chili
once again
it was very delicious but not spicy
we ordered side of gralic naan
and it was very good
also
the server suggested we get peas pilau
which was basmati_rice seasoned with peas
nuts
and raisins
i didn't care for the raisins and probably would opt for just regular basmati_rice next time
we also shared an indian variety of beer based_on the server's suggestion
it was good and quite large
all in all
the food was good and the portions generous
but
the total did leave a bit of a sticker shock
i think i'd opt for the lunch buffet and try to sample more of their dishes
the service
as i mentioned before
was superb
i would recommend_this_place if you are in the area and craving quality indian food and great service
they have a good selection for their_lunch_buffet
have both veggie and meat options
always love their dessert options and garlic_naan
staff is friendly
best indian food i've had in vegas
clean
polite
tasty
and a wide_variety
my_only_complaint is the parking
keep up the great work
yum
star customer_service was awesome
they really helped me out as it was my very first time really eating indian food
my friend is also on a vegan diet and they helped him pick the foods he can eat
extremely helpful
stars for the environment
handcrafted art and tapestry walls surround you in the restaurant and it feels kind of intimate and romantic
stars garlic_naan
don't leave this place w out trying it especially if you're into bread and garlic like i am
it is so tasty i finished the entire basket myself
stars chicken_tikka_masala
yum
buttery curry and mildly spicy over a bed of their rice
so good
stars fried okra
my friend ordered spicy so it was a lot to handle but the veggies went really well to compliment my chicken
coming_back for sure
my mom is british
so i grew_up on indian food
brits love indian like we americans love mexican
i've tried dozens of restaurants and even tried to make it at home a few times
this is one of the best indian places i've ever been to and it's certainly the best in las_vegas henderson
the staff is attentive and polite
the food is good and spicy
and the mango shake is delicious
that's all you need to know now go and try it
great food and great service
very friendly_staff and right in henderson
we_will_definitely_be_back
i liked it
very good
spices were excellent
i really enjoyed the mint chicken and the mango curry
the tandori was a bit salty and did not like it that much
otherwise
i would have given stars
however
i will return to this place soon
this place is in the same plaza as bj's
and it is fairly easy_to_find if you use the turning lane in the middle of the block
i arrived here with some friends on friday afternoon shortly_after lunch hour
it wasn't too crowded
and they got put tables together to accommodate us sufficiently
we went straight for the buffet without even thinking about the menu
although it's pretty easy to justify eating the lunch buffet here when you do look at the entree prices
the buffet table nearest to the clean plates is clearly all vegetarian items
and the next table has meat dishes
a small salad_bar
and desserts
all the items are clearly labeled by name and with ingredients
while i don't remember all the names offhand
i loved the chicken_korma
really enjoyed the vegetable_samosas and chicken_tikka_masala
also liked the tandoori_chicken and saag
spinach
and generally had no issue with other dishes except for the goat_curry
that thing does not taste like goat
or like any particular meat
also
your choice of butter or garlic_naan is brought out from the kitchen to your table
although i've only been to two lunch_buffets at indian_restaurants
i feel that there's enough good food here to grant this place five_stars
with of course some consideration that buffet food is generally not on par with a la_carte courses
check it out whether you like indian food or whether you just want a change of pace
we got delivery from here last_night
a tuesday
the food was awesome
everything was hot
crispy and very flavorful
the gentleman who took my order was very polite and made sure to get all of our details correct
he recommended the rice with raisins and cashew
which was not to be missed
it totally made the meal
everything in the vegetarian appetizer platter was still crispy
not soggy like i expected from my usual delivery experiences
the portions were generous but not too much to finish
we will definitely be repeat customers to this fabulous gem of a restaurant
maybe next time we will dine in for the full experience
thank you for the yumminess
the staff_is_very_friendly
my family loves it when we go here
we have tried many different dishes from the menu and so far
so good we have enjoyed all of them
on our last visit the waiter made a bet with us that we would enjoy an indian beer better than what we were about to order
and sure enough we like it better
unfortunately
i cant remember_the_name of it so i need to go back soon
the naan_bread and chicken are fantastic
i come here for the lunch buffet pm since i can never make up my mind on choosing one item at an indian restaurant
the buffet rocks since it's all_you_can_eat and a great way to try_new_things
i'm a huge_fan_of their paneer saag
aloo_tikki
tandoori_chicken and chaana masala
their chutney selection is great and i love their pakkoras
the manager is always there making sure water is being refilled and making sure i'm enjoying everything
the restaurant is clean and so is the restroom
love_this_place
i have been seeking out good indian food since a trip to seattle in
my quest is finally over
until i move to minneapolis in september
we tried the mushroom matar curry and the lamb_tikka_masala
both delicious with the zeera rice
the flavors were impeccable and the portion_sizes were perfect
friend_of_mine also highly recommends the tandoori_chicken
says it's the best in town
we also tried the green chili naan and the garlic_naan
we were a little disappointed that the green chili one was not as spicy as it was advertised
but the garlic_naan surely made up for it
i will be back
probably more frequently than the waistline on my pants wants me to
this place continues to be a wonderful eating establishment
wonderful staff
super cheap lunch buffet with great choices
we finally got the time to check out the dinner menu
it was wonderful
the menu had so much to choose from
and we tried new breads that we never even heard of
lots of fun
nice_atmosphere too
be warned the dinner entrees are huge
most likely intended to share
we overbought the first time expecting a cat dish of curry
we should have known better
all portions were well made and generous
they offer a few meal deals at night
the soup was wonderful
we have been coming here since and never got sick
which is a big_deal for us
we have never had lousy service
the new manager is always smiling
wonderful place
recommended
the boyfriend and i went for lunch based off of yelp_reviews
it was my first time trying indian food and it was okay
found out i'm not a fan_of_indian_food
unfortunately
my taste_buds didn't have an a ha moment
boo
i was really excited about trying something new and hoping to find a new favorite restaurant
however
the naan was very fresh and tasty
much better than trader joe's
duh cody
so the yelpers did me right on that review
the buffet lunch was very reasonably_priced at around
and had a nice portion of vegetarian_options as well as carnivore options
the service was decent and atmosphere was ok
seemed clean until i saw the employee transferring food from his pan into the serving pan with his bare hand
not a good moment for me
being a germ a phobe and immediately stopped eating
i didn't share this with my boyfriend in an effort not to completely ruin lunch and the fact that he thinks i'm a little ocd
had it not been for this incident
i would have probably said it was an okay lunch
probably won't be re visiting taj
decided to be adventurous and came here because of the rating
the service was excellent and attentive at all the right times
food presentation was nice
chicken_tikka_masala and naan were excellent
we tried dishes with naan and drinks
spent over
will_be_coming_back
listen
there are only one or two other indian_restaurants that compare to this one in town
mint is great if you want real clean high_quality indian food with tiny portions
origin is great if you want a fine_dining feel and you want to pay a lot
this place is great if you want delicious and huge portions
i would skip any other indian place in town
i have never tried indian food before
so i was excited
when my friend and i walked in at first we thought it was dead but when we came inside there was actually a lot of people
the service was great
they are very attentive and very helpful
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala and my friend ordered the lamb mango curry
both dishes was delicious
have to order the peas pillau and the garlic_naan
and their mango lasse was very refreshing
my friend and i loves to eat and try new places
since this was my first time trying indian food
i would definitely let my friends know about this place and i would come back to try more of their dishes
i was first introduced to indian food back in riverside
california
a number of years_ago by my significant other
who loves indian food
i have to admit while it was tasty
it wasn't anything i was in love with
we found this place because it is across_the_street from our apartment complex
price wise
it's a bit expensive
but the dishes are amazing
my first dish was the mango lamb_curry
mild spice_level
mind you
delicious
the lamb is tender with just a bit of fat and tendon to make it just that more yummy
but not make me feel guiltyl for eating that extra stuff
my significant other ordered a paneer dish
also delicious
a few weeks after we went there
he discovered that taj_palace had a lunch buffet for only
yay
all their dishes were scrumptious
during the lunch buffet
i tried the goat_curry
some vegetarian platters
and their peas pillau
the goat in the goat_curry was as wonderful as the lamb in the lamb_curry
their vegetarian platters were all delicious and the peas pillau was gastronomically pleasing
we have made several trips back to taj_palace and will probably be making more
oh
and one can't go to an indian restaurant without ordering naan
i love indian food
this place is by far one of my favorite places to visit in the las_vegas metropolitan area
the lunch buffet is only
and the selection is nice and fresh
i love the tiki_masala
the fresh garlic_nan and the samosa's are also pretty big and flavorful
i'm not a vegetarian
but have to admit some of their non meat dishes are also quite tasty and delicious
it was hard for me to find a decent indian restaurant in sin city
but this location satisfied my indian cravings and is definitely a spot to check out if you're visiting las_vegas
located in neighboring henderson off of the freeway on eastern ave
i had a sudden craving_for_indian_food and this was the only place nearby
because i read the hours wrong
i arrived about minutes before p and therefore during the time they're closed
their hours are a to p
then p to
p
i found something to do in the meanwhile because i was still craving_indian_food and arrived a few minutes after p
as soon as you enter the restaurant
there is a strong aroma that may be a little overpowering
i wanted to do the take out option and was seated at the bar waiting to order
it took longer than i expected
but the people were nice and kept offering me drinks
they took my order
lamb_tikka_masala and chicken curry
and i played on my phone in the meanwhile
a word of caution
i didn't order any naan because i had rice at home
but it looks like just one piece_of_naan is
one piece of garlic_naan is
no
thank you
they arrived with my food
i paid
and i went home
i've never really had indian food before and fortunately
i was not disappointed with my choices
both the lamb_tikka_masala and chicken curry were delicious
the portions were big enough that i had leftovers that still tasted good the day after
i'd definitely go back and order more food for take out
love_this_place
their menu is pretty pricey though
very helpful staff
i always leave with more food than i should probably be getting
definitely give their_lunch_buffet a shot
very good lunch buffet
but usually the same items
the food generally has a pretty good and consistent flavor and is prepared well
the restaurant tends to be very quiet
which is great for lunch time meetings
it's also very clean
service is very prompt
the only ding on a star is the lack of variety
every time i've been in it's the same dishes with no rotation
i'm sad it took me so long to try this place
great lunch buffet with a mild to medium_spice
attentive staff
very clean and well decorated place
however
i was disappointed that they didn't have rice_pudding on their buffet
the food is good
but i have to warn you
if your body is not used to curry
be afraid
lol
after recently relocating to las_vegas
i decided it was time to scout out a place to turn to when i'm experiencing a craving_for_indian_food
i wouldn't say i'm an expert
but i spend most of my dining out experiences in indian_restaurants and this time
i wasn't too impressed
disclaimer
i have left behind the perfect indian restaurant where i recently moved from and i know nothing will ever compare
we ordered paneer pakoras
chicken_tikka_masala
spice_level
and chicken curry
spice_level
the paneer pakoras were fresh and fluffy
but lacked flavor or spice
the sauce for the tikka masala was okay
but no amount of creamyness or richness would save the dry chunks of chicken
the spice_level was pretty good
but if you like spicy indian food
you better order something higher_than a because a is the equivalent of mild
in my opinion
the curry was tender
but just okay
nothing much to report on that
my biggest problem with this place is the price
the naan and rice are an additional
not to mention the fact that each entree item is about a piece
yes
you get a lot of food
but that's standard at any indian restaurant
the naan is nothing exceptional
either
our total bill came out to
which is crazy
with as many places las_vegas has to offer me
i won't be returning
the staff is nice
though
i'd like to amend my review a little now that i've been back so many times
i've tried the lunch buffet twice in two days
i'm officially hooked
the service is pretty attentive
vimil
vick
is very friendly
he makes an extra effort to remember his customers and takes pride in his job
he's remembered my name ever since i paid with a credit_card
him and other staff always keep my_water_glass quite full
a definite necessity in an indian restaurant
we got there by about pm and the lunch buffet closes at pm
at exactly
pm the server came over and informed us that they were closed and it was time for us to go
i thought this was a little abrupt
but we were mostly finished
so we left
i really like the varied options depending_on the day
the samosa's were really good
filled with spicy potato
these were a little spicy
but very tasty
i poured a little bit of mint_chutney over the top and it was perfect
i actually wished they would have had them the second day
i also really liked the chicken_tikka_masala
because i love the red sauce that it comes in
perfect for dipping naan
there was also a white cream based chicken dish that was really tender
on my first visit i didn't have room to try the tandoori_chicken on the bone
but on my nd visit there was tandoori_chicken pieces and they were pretty tender
i like my stuff super saucy
so i dipped my tandoori_chicken in the raita
spiced yogurt
and it was delicious
garlic_naan is the way to go
i love me some garlic
the naan has came out piping_hot
super fresh on every visit
also on my first trip i brought my vegan friend and she had a lot of options to choose from and was very happy with the selections
i would definitely recommend telling the server if you are vegan because one of the labels above the food was inaccurate
for my second visit i brought two indian food experts
they both agreed that it was a pretty good buffet
especially for the price
they seemed to enjoy the food
but one of them felt that the dishes could have used a little more spices
both of them agreed they would rather have the dishes spicier
but realize that with a buffet it's usually going to be mild to medium
i would definitely like to come back during dinner and try some of the menu_items
although i think i'll have a hard time staying away from this buffet
i love having tons of options and you_can't_beat the price
about per_person
i just moved to the area
and this is the first indian i have tried in the las_vegas metro
so i am comparing it to the only other_indian_places i really know
in the kansas city metro
this place sucks compared to kc
nothing was free
no papads given
no lassi or kolfti samples
not even the rice
you had to pay for the rice separately
it wasn't very good
either
the food was mediocre
i can make a better veggie_korma and i am a white girl from wichita
ks
the service was very poor
i won't be in a hurry to come back
maybe i will try the lunch buffet at some point
maybe
great food as per normal
just a little too expensive for indian though
however
i have come to expect that in las_vegas now
ordered take out last_night and it was surprisingly fresh and good
the chicken_tikka_masala
aloo_gobi and mushroom mattar all tasted authentic
the samosas and naan were excellent
i have eaten at many an indian_cuisine resteraunt from here to ontario
so i'd like to say my palate is seasoned
taj has good food
alot better than the three other resteraunt's that were here that served canned curry and canned veggies at the buffet
the naan is great and compared to their competitors it surpasses them easily
the butter_chicken is flavorful and nothing on the menu tastes artificial
ghandi's is still my favorite in town
then orgin india and this place is third
but if you want a quick buffet that is yumy and satisfies the senses
come here
as for customer_service they are always great
very friendly and funny
and i love the open seating
over all stars
dang near perfect
best indian lunch buffett in las_vegas
the food quality is consistent
the staff is friendly
affordable priced
you can't_go_wrong if you like indian food
the garlic_naan is outstanding and the chicken_tikka_masala is the best i ever had
try it
great place for buffet lunch
unfortunately the same exact food is offered at dinner for x the price
strangely we were at the buffet and at were told they are ready to close and asked us to leave
this place is good
it's just a little overpriced for my taste
i'm better off making it at home
i went here for the first time for lunch
i had a great experience
the staff is friendly_and_attentive
the price is great for a lunch buffet
the quality of the food is good
i found some of the sauces a little too creamy for my liking
i thought the variety of vegetarian and meat dishes was good
i wish the buffet had more dessert options
this is my new go to place for lunch when i want indian food
we visited this place last_night for dinner
there were other parties dining there when we arrived
the place was nicely_decorated for a strip_mall restaurant and the staff seemed friendly and welcoming
nehil was our waiter and the experience we had with him garnered taj_palace this one star_review
another couple came in after we did and nehil spent minutes chatting with the couple at the next booth
talking_about himself
when he did stop by to take our order i told_him that i wanted the vegetarian appetizer platter and he said
you don't want to order that
that's going to fill you up and you won't eat the entree
i then ordered a potato filled bread and he said
you don't want to order that
take the garlic_naan
as if he wants to tell me what to eat
i deferred to my husband who wanted the half tandoori_chicken and nehil said to him
you don't want to order that
take the fish entree
i asked to speak to a manager and he said none was available
i then asked for a business card and the name of the owner and as we were leaving a group of men entered through the back door
i spoke to one of them and told them about our experience and they just stood there dumbfounded
we left and had a wonderful dinner somewhere_else
too bad taj_palace you lost our business forever
the quote for this place is
guest is as good as god
i think not
my bf took me here for the lunch buffet and it was great
the selection of food was sooooo much better than the other buffet i tried over at india_palace
we even got fresh naan
choice of garlic and regular
loved the samosa and the mango chicken curry
will_definitely_go_back
this is a great selection of food for only
even just dish is worth the price
in our party of on a saturday_night we had one indian food newbie and a couple greenhorns
we asked the acting manager to bring a dish for everyone to share
family_style
that represents dishes of which they are proud
he beamed at the opportunity and the staff was incredible in their service
those of us who regularly love indian food couldn't have asked for a nicer
more friendly and higher quality experience with which to introduce friends to this cuisine
i even appreciate that they took emphasis to make the vegetarian in our group
me
feel catered among the majority meat dishes
i adored my tikka masala paneer
rice
with pine nuts and raisins
and mushroom veg dishes
and everyone_else raved for the tandoor lamb ribs
curries
and shrimp
i wish i were eating indian food like this all the time and with management staff who is this splendid
no matter the cuisine
but alas i don't live in the vegas area
taj_palace is a treasure in the land of ordinarily low expectations for nondescript strip_mall restaurants
after my appointment
i was hungry and decided_to_give this place a try
they had a big sign out front that said
best of vegas
i was excited_to_try it
they were only serving buffet bar
so that's what i got
my waiter was not very friendly
he did not look happy to be there
the buffet bar had about different items plus rice and a vegetable_samosa
i was a bit disappointed with the selection
i tried a little of everything
nothing really stood_out
it was all just ok
the goat_curry was mostly bones and gristle
ugh
if this is the best indian food that vegas has to offer
i feel sorry for this town
great food
i have been to almost every indian restaurant in the las_vegas area and can say without a doubt that this one is one of the best
sure it's a little pricey
but they give you huge portions
food was great
staff_was_very_friendly and took care of everything i wanted
stop by here
you will be glad you did
wonderful experience food is fantastic and service is delightful
decent buffet
limited vegetarian_options but good enough
nice place to eat
non_veg options seems to be great
great food
good selection of veg curries at buffet
choose from
fresh and tasty garlic_naan
tastefully done interiors and decor
clean bathroom with diaper changing station
our little one was sleeping
she woke up mins before pm
close
and they accommodated us for mins after close while she ate
came here for dinner with a bunch of friends and got seated_right_away since it wasn't busy at all
the ambiance is nice and relaxing
there was some incense burning and although the smell wasn't really all that pleasant
i got over it eventually and didn't think much of it
for our dinner outing
i opted for the paneer_tikka_masala paired up with some garlic_naan
the food was alright but nothing_to_write_home_about
i thought the tikka masala lacked flavor and the naan was a bit dry in comparison to what i am used to at other places
other people in my party ordered the chicken_tikka_masala and i decided to get in on it just to see if there was any difference in flavor between the two
surprisingly
there was not
oh well
i came to get fed and that happened so i guess i'm good haha
luckily
someone in our group had a coupon to take off some of the damage from the bill
not bad but not enticed to come here on a regular semi regular_basis
i'd probably give it another chance but might expand to other options on the menu instead of my usual indian comfort dinner dish
we'll see
rant
great stuff the rice dishes were as spicy hot as i'd hoped they were
and the tandoori shrimp were more like tandoori prawns
real sized prawns
portions were huge
that's always awesome
service was great
just what i expected
answered questions
brought us more water on a regular_basis
check came quickly
food came quickly
etc
this place is way better than mount_everest india's_cuisine
i don't know understand why that place gets more stars than taj_palace
this place has better portions
comparable prices and better service
and the food comes out faster
after my first visit here
i came back the very next night for takeout
more tandoori shrimp
basmati_rice
and the usual chicken masala
can't_go_wrong
if you want great indian food at reasonable_prices
and you have a big stomach
definitely visit taj_palace
criticisms
lighting could_have_been_better
seemed kind of dingy
decor could use an upgrade
overall
service
a
servers were friendly and answered questions i had about the food
food
a
great selection
big portions
atmosphere
b
chill and relaxed
but could use an upgrade in lighting and decor
the only indian food i've_ever_eaten has always been in california
a tandoori_chicken leg
a piece_of_naan
rice
one type of curry would come up to for one person
at taj_palace
you can have all of that in a lunch buffet for just
i'd say that there were about ten different_types_of curries
give or take
i was ecstatic
everything was delicious
however
the buffet ends at pm
and i thought the menu prices were a bit high
i probably wouldn't come here for dinner
this indian buffet is best in las_vegas
we never had bad food here and always satisfied with quality and reasonable_price
this is one of my favorite restaurants in las_vegas
hendertucky's indian restaurant
not a food cart or truck behind a grocery_store or a converted gasoline station
it's a real dedicated indian restaurant with real indian decor
i understand it been under new ownership for two years plus
it's our first visit under the present ownership
we came for the lunch buffet around pm this friday
there were still a few occupied tables and the buffet carts were filled with food
of course i ordered their garlic_naan plus a kashmiri naan
it was most disappointing
yu go chauffeur always eats the veggies first and saves the meats for the second plate
he loved the spiciness of the veggies but he thought the meats were a little underseasoned
but not a problem
he dunks everything in their green
white and red sauces anyway
it's a charming place to relax and enjoy which we certainly can attest to
best indian food every love the coconut curry and the samosas are the best
i cant wait_to_go_back
this place has authentic_indian_food
the service is great
the prices unbelievably low and the food quality is extraordinary
i have been eating there for over two years and i have never had a bad experience
if you go for lunch
they have buffet for only
and it's totally_worth it
highly_recommended
great service
very friendly_and_helpful
food was great
better than i expected
i hate it when i ask for spicy and it comes out mild but this place did_not_disappoint
overall the food was very good
this is going to be my go to place for good indian food
just finished our third visit
second dinner here
we got the non vegetarian meal for two
everything was great
spiced to our request of medium heat_level on the lamb and soup
we have enough left over for lunch tomorrow and we are both stuffed tonight
there was lots of flavor and every dish was distinctive unto itself
there were only two other tables with patrons and nobody else came before we left
too bad as the food and service are both quite good and i for one want to see them busy enough to insure they are here for a long time
my friend and i visited on a friday_night
it was a tad busy
but otherwise ok
there were some hiccups in service
however the food made up for it
i had the chicken skewers with peanut satay
along with the lemon chicken
i must say both were absolutely_delicious
the lemon chicken was the best i've had in ages
they have a great selection of unique mixed drinks that were delicious as well
the best indian food and service in lv
henderson
i've been coming here since this place opened
the lunch buffet is great
love the goat
mango chicken and samosa are great
one of the best indian_buffets around
definitely check lunch it out if you like indian food
wait_staff is on top on service
buffet had a very good selection of both vegetarian and
carnivore
entr es
they even had a goat_curry
for the price of
per_person
it's a worthwhile find
great lunch buffet
lots of variety of vegie curries and meat curries including goat or lamb
some good chutney and sauces and fresh vegetables
the naan was pretty good
extremely clean place and nice_atmosphere
however the lunch buffet was pretty pricey
i would go more often if it weren't for the price
i will travel further to find good value
the chicken_tikka_masala is to die for
the servers are very efficient and nice
right when you sit_down
they bring over water
indian chips
and two sides to dip the chips in
the green one is pretty spicy
be aware
the red one isn't as spicy
but so great
today we had the spiciness a
which was almost a little too spicy for me but still good
i haven't tried the buffet
but will soon for sure
i highly_recommend this place
the atmosphere is nice and welcoming and i've never had to wait_for_a_table
i am so in love
absolutely_amazing flavor
beautiful set up
and extremely friendly_staff
we will_be_going_back
after a hike yesterday
we stopped here for their_lunch_buffet
it was almost empty when we arrived but we must have been a draw because business picked_up while we were there
they brought us ice water and we ordered garlic_naan
in fact
we ordered a second basket of garlic_naan before we even started with the first
it was quite good
the first part of the buffet had all vegetarian_dishes
some of the standouts here were the pakoras
large triangles filled with a spicy mix of vegetables
and the saag
the saag had excellent flavorings and was very tasty
i also tried some of the lentils and they were also good
in the second section
i had some goat_curry
chicken_tikka_masala
and tandoori_chicken
the chicken_tikka_masala was standard as was the goat_curry
the tandoori_chicken was a bit dry
a couple of things i noted that were different
there is no silverware on the table
you pick_up utensils at the buffet when you're there or you go back and get if you forget
i was expecting some kind of mtv india music_playing or video
but they had their tv off which was quite ok
but instead
we had pop music which just didn't seem to fit the place
the room is pleasant
service was ok
and the lunch buffet was good
there are a few standout items as mentioned
i didn't have dessert
not even kheer
which almost unheard of for me
the naan filled me up quite nicely along with two plates of food
tried the lunch buffet and it was delicious
also had the mango yogurt drink
loved it and it definitely helped with the spicy food
if you can't take the spiciness
you can ask for this white sauce thingy that you can add to your food to make it less spicy
which i did
lots of vegetarian_options
but also had goat and chicken entrees
the buffet even had some desserts such as watermelon slices and rice_pudding
the service was amazing
the waiter kept the water refills coming and took the dirty dishes right away
and lastly
the interior decorations and the ambiance of the restaurant is perfect
very indian style and great for groups or even dates
had the lunch buffet here
such a great deal for the authentic cuisine
everything was delicious
especially paired with the fresh garlic_naan
the restaurant is nicely_decorated and had a warm
inviting feel
great place to stop by with a group or even for a date
the staff was courteous and made sure we were taken_care_of
great food
great atmosphere
i'm so stuffed
and we're taking most of the food home in doggy bags
would've included a picture but everything looked so good we dug in before we realized
sorry i've been passing this place for years
finally made up my mind and arrived at
today
sure glad that i need
the food was first class buffet
did not eat any of the pure vegan dishes
not my preference
the various rices were fresh and fluffy
nothing looked like ye
sterday
all the meat dishes were surprisingly delicious
nothing was over spiced
just right
my system does not tolerate spices very well
the rice_pudding desert was different but excellent as well
service was spot on
one of the tests of restaurants
for myself is the cleanliness of the rest rooms
five_stars clean here
i'm sure to be back in the future
everything was amazing
tender meat delicious sauces
menu needs more pictures because the food is even prepaired beautifully
they can serve jain food
a classy and sophisticated restaurant at a few miles distance from vegas strip
delicious food and the staff_was_very_friendly to accommodate our jain food requirements
try the paneer butter masala
totally_worth it
don't forget
yelp_check_in provides free_mango_lassi
i love this little restaurant
everything on the menu is delicious and the service is always great
their butter_chicken is amazing
and the lentil soup has really intricate flavors absolutely_delicious
i also love their chicken_tikka and tikka masala you really can't_go_wrong with any dish here
and don't forget e garlic_naan
tasty food and friendly_staff
been coming here a few years
the prices have risen lately
but still within my budget for indian food
been here about a couple times now and i must say i like the place
service has been pretty good
the staff are friendly_and_attentive
the food takes longer to make and prep
in my opinion
but worth_the_wait as soon as you get to eating
what i've gotten the last two visits are the infamous tikka masala and chicken tandoori
tikka masala famous dish in all indian places that they guarantee all first timers will like
pieces of moist
tender chicken cooked in a tomato y
gingery sauce
very rich and hearty
suggest you dip their freshly baked garlic_naan in this sauce
chicken tandoori sizzling
marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor
on a bed of peppers and onions
seasoned very well
comes out in the red color because of the spices
moist and a little spicy for my palette but i still love the dish
great to eat with their basmati_rice
i'm glad we took our friend
sandra r
here for her first time
a bit scared at first because she hated the smell that all indian places have
she liked it
definitely ate everything on her plate
upon paying and getting ready to leave
the waiter was so sweet
providing a small bowl of mango_ice_cream and put a candle on it because it was her birthday
small gestures are a plus
will definitely be coming_back when craving_indian_food
i hope to try their buffet style one day
but available only from monday sunday
am to
pm
late nite munchies and beer a winner on leith
with their fantastic bar menu this place has become a real late_night hit with leithers
as one of the only places with a am closing time this place has become a buzz with late_night customers
they serve up some cracking naans and dahls as well as an assortment of tasty seafood done in stunning fresh tasty sauces
if you have read many of my reviews you will know how i feel about seafood
they have theirs delivered fresh from newhaven ona regular_basis and it really shows
for a meal its not a place for a quick bite to eat
best to order some nibbles and enjoy a beer as due to the fact the food is made to order the waiting times can be quite long
but hell is it worth it
lip smackingly good spice and ferocious flavour
jd happy man
p
s
a must try for any leither

s non leithers stay_away its our you cant have it
after a long wait i was finally at guchhis last_night for dinner
my partner was there for a meal a couple_of_weeks back and thought the week day tapas menu was tasty and good value
maybe if we'd had this option i would have left with a slightly more positive feelings about the place
on the plus side
it was a nice
bright restsurant with good space and a friendly atmosphere
the staff were very attentive and went to the effort of preparing my friend a surprise birthday pudding
however
i
and quite a few of our group
felt the menu was extremely over priced for what turned_out_to_be fairly ordinary food of extremely small portions
i was quite looking_forward to my first ever tandoori dish which
at
proved to be a more than a wee bit dissapointing when king prawns turned up on a plate
tasty though they were
they were far from exceptional
the house wine was also a let down
a cheap supermarket wine
normally found in for offers
cost us
and we were only glad the curry killed the taste
i'd go back and give this place a second chance with their tapas menu
but suggest for the future they either lower their prices or increase their portions
and definately get their wines sorted out
failing that
i'd take the money i would have spent
hopped on a bus to methven in perthshire and eat another meal of the most amazing indian_food_i've_ever_had
a restaurant by the name of chatni
we have been a few times and we've always had great service and fantastic food
their indian tapas is a great deal
and their dahl is my favourite in edinburgh
a great addition to leith
had a lovely meal at guchhi on saturday_night
the place was busy
but overall it didn't feel harried to dine there in fact
it was the opposite
the tapas dishes were tasty
black lentils all chipotle smoky goodness
what a surprise
with only the chargrilled prawns feeling like the poorer child
but only in flavour
but beautifully cooked
aloo chana was fantastic and sealed the meat eating silent reviewer's fate as a chickpea lover
it won't be long now til i get him off bovine and onto bream and broccoli
sweet and sour haddock had a lovely delicate flavour much more understated than that of the chinese variety
for me
i wasn't a big_fan of the naans we ordered
i found them too thin and dry
but the sr disagreed on that particular point
and tapas dishes more than plenty
especially when sharing
even though i really did want to squeeze in the scallops with chilli butter
we just couldn't
but
it's a place i want to return to
so hopefully next time
i will
i really enjoyed guchhi
i thought the quality of the dishes was very high
and the tapas selection had a really good variety to it
service was first rate and i liked the decor of the place
too
well worth a visit
i'd say
overall
we said
guchhi was really rather good
offering satisfying dishes at a very reasonable cost
it's a great late place
given that it serves until am
so i can imagine it's somewhere we may well visit again for late evening nibbles
ended_up down the shore trying to avoid the festival madness on a rainy sunday_afternoon and happened on guchhi by accident
the food was excellent we had a mix of mussels
scallops
madras and chicken pakora on their tapas for deal
the nan and pilau_rice that we ordered were a step above the average too
if you find yourself down the shore i would definately recommend a visit to guchhi
great food and service
swings and roundabouts i have to say for guchhi
i've been here a number of times as it is literally minutes walk from where i live and tapas in any cuisine is my preferred way of eating
the first couple_of_times i went my partner and i loved it
the quality of the meat
seafood and cooking was excellent
the same goes for the service
excellent
however recently when we've been in we've had mix ups with our order
which we ended_up paying for
and the quality of the dishes served just didn't seem to be up to scratch
i ordered the chicken pakora in there last weekend and some of the chicken came out raw in the middle
not good if you're nearly months pregnant like me
i don't think i'll be back there until a number of reviewers convince me otherwise to be honest such a shame as it does have potential
this place is the best indian food my wife and i have ever had
the service is excellent the atmosphere is perfect
if you havant been you have to go
you_won't_be_disappointed trust us
scott nikki
i went to guchhi on a saturday evening a couple of weeks_ago
stars might appear a bit frugal to some of the yelpers who swear by this place but i can assure you i did not make the decision lightly
it was carefully calculated by using a system which shall be explained in detail if you read on
the waiter took our drinks order and asked us if we wanted poppadums to start with which we said yes to
the poppadums arrived with mango_chutney and a hot and sweet onion dip which we demolished within seconds
we ordered items from the tapas menu the chilli tandoori kind prawns
chilli butter scallops
butter_chicken and lamb_rogan_josh with pilau_rice and peshwari_naan
the waiter appeared a bit concerned that we only wanted tapas dishes between us and asked us several times if we were sure we only wanted those many
he almost seemed like a salesman whose commission earned was directly proportional to the dishes we ordered
the chilli tandoori king prawns beautifully spiced and cooked_to_perfection stars
butter_chicken pretty average stars
lamb_rogan_josh lamb was nice and tender but the sauce wasn't very flavoursome and missed the oomph that i had expected
stars
the chilli butter scallops highly disappointing
we got tiny
circumference of just over a pence coin
scallops in their shells smothered in sauce which completely overpowered the delicate scallops star
the score averages to
stars
it may seem unfair but i had to take away
for being charged separately for the dips that were served with the poppadums which we hadn't explicitly ordered
it could've just been a bad day at the office for the chef and i do hope i am more impressed the next time i visit
l o c a t i o n
the general area of commercial street at the bottom of leith is getting better
although quite industrial at points
there is a real sense that in years to come it will be a lovely polished letter
l
g u c h h i
inside the decor was quite fresh
not over crowded and quite typically modern indian in my point of view
if you get what i mean
neat
tidy
relatively classy but not ott
spacious
respectable
and all pulled together with soft mellow music_playing in the background
o f f e r s
speaking of
classy
a group of us had a groupon vouched for tapas dishes and cocktails
worked out about
each with this offer
however
we did add on two naan breads
rices
and were offered poppadoms and dips at the start
which we did actually think were complimentary
and ended_up not being
add a bottle of rose and a cola to this and the total for added bits and pieces came to
so pretty much another per_person for the poppadoms dips
half a naan_bread half rice
a glass_of_wine and a shot of cola if we had done so which is reasonable per_person but was quite sneaky regarding the
chip
poppadoms
dip
having said that
per_person for what we had was quite good
the menu was filled with things i'd never heard of
being a less than part time indian foodie
so it took us a while to order but we finally got there
f o o d
as a group we kind of ordered a bit of everything and planned to have a nibble of everything don't think it really happened with us
probably cause the table was smothered with an array of different indian cuisines
but the overall quality of the food was good
there was nothing i would say that was negative about the food but also i'd say that there was nothing spectacular about it either
one of the dips that was served at the start with the poppadoms was a spiced sauce with chunks of lime
it was odd as i first thought it was some sort of vegetable but upon realising it's super juicy sour taste i stayed away from that one
i suppose it was kind of mixing the super hot chili with the lime to get a balance
g o o d f o r
groups
couples
friends
bar
open until am which i presume the bar will be occupied mostly and also maybe for late_night food servings it delivers so i presume it caters for take away also
i want to preface this entire review with
it really should and could be at least a four
and it's a really nice place and i liked it
i was swithering between three and two stars
but i'm giving it credit for potential
guchhi really has the stuff to make itself a hero of leith
and i regret this will read as a pretty negative review
because instead of one big flaw dragging it down
which i could mention in passing and scoot on by
there are lots of little things that will take longer to talk about
making this probably sound more like a two star_review
so
again
reiterating it's a really nice place and i liked it
however
it's looking a bit tired on the outside the door frame is peeling and tattered
but once i got in
i felt myself smile
because it's really quite lovely
big high ceilings
clever decoration
a very lovely swinging egg chair
i want one
warm and toasty
and a general sense of elegance
we came on a groupon deal for four tapas and two cocktails at about
i can't remember the exact amount
and were fully prepared for a lovely seafood feast
however
the waiter swiftly informed us that all fish was off
shellfish
fine
but no fishywishy
it hadn't come in off the boat
well
i mean
i thought that the good part of that was that the fish they serve is fresh
but the bad part is that the fish they serve they actually don't serve
the manner in which the news was delivered to us suggested that this is very much standard routine at lunchtimes
half the menu
at least
is out of bounds
o
kay
so i plumped for a clam starter
sarah l had the mussels
and we both went for a chickeny thing for main
a big plus point is that my fear with tapas is a lack of size
and with only four between us i thought i would leave very hungry
even though we added some rice and chapatti to our order
but that wasn't an issue here
i had a bit of a job digging around to find the clams inside the shells under all that sauce
but despite their playful game of hide and seek
they were plentiful and tasty
my first clam experience
the butter_chicken i had for main was nice i'm not sure i'd pay the price on the menu for it
but it was nice
more my kind of thing than the clams
in fact
since i'm a fan of all things chicken
it's also worth noting that we had booked the deal for last week
but they rang up and asked us to change it due to some kitchen issue or other
the deal included cocktails
but alas
there was a mocktail fail
i think what i was delivered was actually
basically
just mango juice
it was nice
sure
but the girl had vowed some kind of mocktaily thing
ah yes
the girl
there were two tables occupied ours
and another table of two
it's quite a big place
so it's a shame that it was so empty on a friday lunchtime in such a good location
i guess sometimes i'd be inclined to forgive cold and unsmiling service if a place were heaving with people
thinking
gosh
it must be so tough to deal with all of these people
i know i could never do this job well
but really
when there are four people in your restaurant
it's not hard to raise a bit of conversation or at least smile
rather than saying the bare minimum
this wasn't voucher treatment
i know some people say they're ill treated because they come on a voucher
because she was like it from the off
before sarah presented the voucher
so
she was just naturally mardy
so
in summary
no fish dishes
in which they're supposed to specialise
unfriendly and somewhat dilatory service
lame attempt at some kind of non alcoholic cocktail
but nice place
decent food
good portions
i do want to go back
perhaps in an evening
and try it again
because
like i said
it's lovely or it ought to be
it's got all the potential
and it clearly has been for other yelpers in the past
i've only been once
but i'll certainly be returning
a smaller
unassuming indian family restaurant serving south_indian food
we went off the beaten track and ordered food i'd never seen anywhere_else before battered mashed potato
stunning
chili idli
stunning
and lamb tanjore
very nice
we also had a paneer dosa that was fantastic
their home made lemonade was lovely
certainly worth trying
the food was very fresh
the service was fairly quick considering that the meals were being prepared fresh we saw the dosa being made
very much like a fresh pizza
marked down from because of it being a cash only establishment
leading to some pocket searching between us
they really do need to get card payments sorted out
gorgeous food vast tablecloth sized dosa pancakes wrapped around spicy potato fillings
with a selection of dips and sauces alongside
the chennai fish_curry was delicious
and the crab curry just amazing
once we worked out how to eat whole little crabs
it's a bit of a bare wee room
and noisy when lots of people are in
but it's worth it for the food
curry good
pancake good
curry pancake great
south_indian_cuisine is becoming more popular these days and with good reason
as it always feels a bit lighter than the usual curry stodgefest
i think curry is much improved by the additional tastes and textures of dosas
idlis and other doughy delights
especially in combination with the various dips and sauces that always accompany them
check out my photo to see how huge the dosa is
everything is fairly cheap so it's easy to try a number of small things
and if you can't decide what to have for your main
just about everything comes in a mini starter size
i would be happy just dipping pieces of the light pancake in all the delicious dips and sauces
but when you also have some tasty curry inside
it's the gift that keeps on giving
if you're bored of the usual curry standards then this place is for you
mmmm
crepe wrapped curries
family_owned
super friendly
b
y
o
b
too
for south_indian style cuisine
tanjore is the best we've found in edinburgh
so far
their dosas have considerable wow factor
and made me a convert to their cause
the place is very welcoming
keeps things nicely informal
and you have a good opportunity to see the chefs at work
dishes are high on flavour
and represent excellent value
overall
we said
i was highly impressed by tanjore
for this style of south_indian food
it was as good as i've experienced in the city
this is definitely a place that i'll be visiting again
in the future
so if you like the sound of it
do give me a shout when you're planning to go
as i'd be happy to join you
i love_this_place
it is so authentic
it reminds me of being in india
the staff are wonderful
the space is clean and bright
the menu is overwhelming
it is cheaper_than the vegetarian restaurant kalpna which is just a few doors down
though i can't decide which is best
i have to say that the dosas at kalpna are the best i have tried in edinburgh
but tanjore does a good job
there are so many options
including uttapam
idli
dosas and thalis
i usually go for the addictive masala_dosa
which comes accompanied with various chutneys and sambar
if you want to try really authentic_indian_food
do come here
expect great service in a casual setting and really lovely food
i recently joined blythe r here for lunch with the purpose of reviewing and we were both pretty well impressed with the place but i'll try to stick to my own opinion here as you can see his below
first up
i wandered in on my own and made a pig's ear of communicating my booking arrangement to the staff and somehow got sat at the wrong table
only to realise that another large table was being quickly set up because i had sat at the wrong one
when realised my booking was for two and not six and
embarrassed
communicated this
i'm sure they had already realised
they didn't show the slightest irritation and happily moved my to another table
service was exemplary
friendly and efficient
once our orders of dosa
idli and utthapam were taken
there was a bit of a wait
but this was deemed well worth it when it emerged that our food had been made fresh to our order
and was frankly delicious
we wanted for nothing throughout the meal as service remained attentive but not at all intrusive
another great part of the experience was that advice we received regarding the menu was honest and we weren't up sold or overly full by the end
the value is as great the south_indian food and i will be going here again
soon
we had a hankering for some south_indian_cuisine so we thought we'd check out tanjore
our meal was incredible
we had the crab curry and a masala_dosa
the masala_dosa is a south_indian classic and these_guys really do it justice
the soft shell crab curry with coconut rice was pretty mind blowing too
full of interesting textures and flavours
everything seemed to be prepared fresh using fresh_ingredients and herbs
the restaurant was clean and the service_was_prompt and friendly
i've been going to tanjore ever since it opened i've been to and ordered from many a indian restaurant in edinburgh and i have to say no other indian restaurant comes close to beating tanjore in price or taste
i've tried quite a few dishes on the menu and a few of the new dishes as well and i've never had anything to say other than amazing for all of them
i can't name any favourites as i love all of them
go and try for yourself
highly_recommended
wow
this is authentic
i've never been to india but dined with people who had and even they were very much impressed by tanjore
from the minute i stepped in the door
i felt_like i was in india
at least how i'd imagined a restaurant in india would look
the decor is great with indian wall hangings on the walls and ceiling
giving a cosey
decorative feel
i had a masala_dosai
something i'd never heard of before but which was recommend to me
so tasty
i love indian food and i'd say i'm a curry girl through and through
but i couldn't help but get excited when i caught sight of the giant curry filled crepe presented before me with a range of sauces and dips
most of which were to my tastes
although i wasn't too keen on the mint dip
they're a generous size but light and just as filling as a main_course should be
i had a mango_lassis which is a thick mango flavoured drink
almost like a milkshake
it was so delicious that i struggled not to finish it before my meal arrived
we had a range of desserts to share which were incredible too
everything i had to eat in tanjore blew my tastebuds away
the service seemed a little slow but perhaps we only noticed since we were in a bit of a rush
they don't accept cards so remember to bring cash
we had to pop out to get some
all in all
a taste_of_india in edinburgh
i'll happily return
for a fairly impromptu mid price meal in honour of my friend's new flat and job
tanjore did the trick nicely
the clean and compact interior feels welcoming enough and fuses east and west nicely with elephant embroidery on the ceiling around a classic chandelier
we both boggled at the sheer range on offer within the menu's numerous pages which include an entire page devoted solely to vegetarian starters before eventually selecting our meals
she plumped for chennai fish_curry with mint rice
and i decided on chicken tanjore with lemon_rice
we were both happy with the delicate balance of flavours in our curries
and my friend's mint rice was pretty special too
the sweetness of the parotta was also a great accompaniment to the spicy flavours of the other food
the service
though
was a little laboured and perfunctory from most quarters
we had three different waiters over the course of the evening
a special mention goes out to the young chap who served us last
though
with a smile that lit the room
i was waiting for my friend to arrive for a good ten_minutes and was not asked if i wanted a drink
similarly
nobody checked on us during our meal to see if everything was ok
our bill came to just under
which is really rather good for what we got
but i can't help feeling that the experience would have left a warmer glow in my memory if the staff had been a little more attentive and personable
i wouldn't object to another trip here but it's not somewhere i'd specifically recommend
been wanting to come here since the place opened and finally got organised this weekend
the restaurant looked a bit tightly packed with tables
but once seated there seemed to be plenty of space
modern asian decorations with some interesting touches here and there
nothing too out there and it did manage to conjure up a comfortable feeling to the place
the service was great from the minute we got in through to getting the bill
the menu_is_extensive with some really interesting bits and bobs i haven't seen elsewhere
the waiter discussed the specials with us and the orders were in
papadam and dips were a highlight nothing too exciting about the dips but the pickle was different to any others i have tried
it seemed like it was homemade rather than from a jar
thumbs_up from me
we ordered papadams and it looked more like or we were given
d
the starters were met with mixed options the chicken and squid tanjores were excellent as were the accompanying salads
the rasa vadai seemed a little strange we hadn't had vadai before but it didn't leave an experience that we wanted to repeat in a hurry
the rasam it was severed in was lovely though
just in case you haven't tried it
rasam is indian tomato_soup and well worth a try
the mains were mixed and i forget what my dinner companions ordered but everything was excellent
both veggies and carnivores alike loved there choices
i went for the special of the day which was rice with a mango tamarind fish_curry with idli on the side
lidls were new to me and were steamed rice and lentil cakes
they didn't really taste of much but they did go well with the curry
the curry had lots of fish but the tamarind was overpowering everything leaving the dish tasting a little bitter
it was really nice just not great
i will be heading back to try some more of the menu as i think the special didn't really work for me
but my companions loved their curries
if the fish_curry had been a little more mango and a little less tamarind this would be a star_review
as all the other dishes were amazing
this was a rather surreal experience i wasn't blown_away at the time
but the more i thought about my dosa
the more i liked it
and the more i wanted to go back
so perhaps this is a
star really rather than a
anyway
buyer beware it's cash only and byob
next
loads of vegetarian_options and lots of interesting and exciting sounding things that really got the mouth_watering
i couldn't decide between the augergine curry
or a dosa
and i plumped for the latter
lucky for me
my friend ordered the aubergine curry perfect
i like a for deal
ok so maybe she got to eat a little bit
we also checked out the parotta bread
mainly because we didn't know what it was
and had a couple of starters
spinach and paneer dumping for me not as exciting as i thought they would be
and chicken pakora
when the dosa appeared
i had the customary reaction of holy moly
it's huge and full of potato
and herbs
not strong flavours
but grew on it as i munched away
it came with some soupy thing
which was pleasant
and some dips to support the dosa
some better than others
the parotta was a novelty and felt deliciously unhealthy
the most strange part was the service
which was all over the place slow to take orders
and then we were pretty much told to hurry up eating our starter
as our main was ready
after rushing through the starter
we abandoned our remaining poppadum
which was then shook at us to keep eating
it felt all rather
odd
it is definitely not a romantic
nor the most luxurious meal
but a week later
i'm missing my dose a dosa
and i'd be happy to go back
looking at other indian restaurant menus just makes me think
hmm
i'd rather go back to tanjore
that must be good
right
as a curry lover it is always nice to find somewhere which has a slightly unique spin on
probably
one of this nations favourite things
tanjore is a real south_indian restaurant
no standard chicken_tikka_masala or vindaloo here
instead what is served is a selection of rich curries
i think most contain yoghurt or coconut milk
cooked well
with an emphasis on vegetarian_options and fish
ok
that is the good
the bad is that the service is just uneven
never unpleasant but perhaps not that interested or simply not aware of where people are in their meals
others have noted this too
so i don't feel i need to push the issue
however it is a shame
all in all tanjore offers good and different curry and it is byob establishment
so i will be back
they just need to sort the service out a little
this place is fantastic
i was not expecting to find delicious indian food
a byo at that
while on vacation in scotland
but i'm so happy we did
the food was delicious and unlike any other indian food i've had in the states
as we mostly have northern indian_cuisine
i love the intricate use of spices and coconut milk as opposed to heavy creams as is common with northern indian_cuisine
the prices were very reasonable and the service was absolutely lovely
if this place were near me in the states i'd be bringing all my friends there
the food was excellent
i agree with the other reviews on this
my concern is cleanliness the waiter dropped utensils on the floor
then picked them up and continued setting tables
he sneezed on the dishes
not ours i would have sent it back
he noticed a piece of gunge on my wife's plate and scraped it off with his fingernail
we did get a clean plate
the toilets were very clean and neither of us got sick but we probably would not go back until the health inspector does a thorough review of this place
too bad as i stated
the food was excellent
we summed it up
go
go now before they get that star and can charge much
much more for what is by far and away the best indian food we've ever had
book now
had been given some recommendations to try this restaurant
it turned_out_to_be a great decision
the food was absolutely_amazing and has to be some of the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
the service was excellent and really couldn't fault a thing about the whole night
highly_recommended the lobster was the real highlight
a little more expensive than your average indian restaurant but then it's not your average indian
i was lucky enough to get the opportunity to come here for a business lunch
and well let's say my work rate declined in the afternoon with a belly full of such delicious food
it's the fine_dining posh sister of the famous kushi's restaurant
we arrived and the atmosphere is tranquil and calm
a morning rushing around was soon forgotten as the ambiance worked it's magic on me
we plumped for the taster menu and started with an unusual chicken salad wrapped in lettuce leaves with grated testy green apple on top
this set the scene for an amazing menu of tasty
unique indian dishes
having lived in singapore for two years i've been spoilt with some fantastic indian dining experiences
but this has to be said was the most unique
flavorful taste sensation i've had
as it was a business lunch we didn't try the wine selection which looked good
but we did try some of the mocktails which really stood_out
i had a watermelon and fresh ginger mix which really went well together and perfectly balanced the food
the service was really friendly and we had some amusing banter
without it being over the top
i would very
very highly_recommend this if_you're_looking for somewhere different at that end of town
they also have a newly opened bar area which is a nice laid back area to enjoy a refreshment or two
i'll_definitely_be_back for more than one visit
we only went for cocktails
but what lovely cocktails they were
so many original creations featuring fresh fruit
passion fruit
pomegranate
pineapple
raspberry
and other flourishes
and if you didn't fancy the special cocktails on the menu
the bartenders were happy to make you anything you desired
and they made it very well
i was pleasantly_surprised
when you think indian restaurant
probably the last thought that comes to mind is amazing cocktail bar
but mithas isn't just your average indian
while they do have an outstanding restaurant
sadly which i have yet to try
they have also extended their venture and a few months previously opened a truly excellent wine and cocktail bar
entering mithas is like entering a very swish five_star hotel and with a quick turn to the right the bar sits
loads of dark work and a nicely proportioned seating_area with about high seats at the actual bar itself
the wine and cocktail menu is large
but not so large that it's difficult to decide on what you want
being on a cocktail quest we of course all immediately focused on the two pages of speciality cocktails to decide our drinks
my first was called devil's candy a delicious mixture of gin muddled with pomegranate and mint
a touch of lemon
and topped up with ginger beer
but the art of the drink was more than just liquid mixed together
my drink was topped with incredibly garnish and a spray of gold dust
it actually looked like christmas in a glass
my second drink of the night was a classy martini called the absolut passion
a martini glass dipped in sugar arrived with a mixture of vodka with fresh strawberry puree
fresh passion fruit
and a sweet touch of gomme syrup
on first sip i was pretty much in love
this may have been a boozy drink
but it went down an absolute treat
i definitely would have ordered another if it hadn't been a school night
in addition to the gorgeous cocktails
the staff at mithas are incredibly lovely
very very accomodating and welcoming
the bartender was an absolute gem mixing up loads of cocktails for our group and the wait_staff even brought out a delicious salad with tender chicken for us to enjoy while we drank
definitely the kind of treatment that you want at such a lovely place
the only negative i can see for mithas wine and cocktail bar is the price
cocktails started at about which is what most people would expect_to_pay on george street
but not down in leith
however
i felt_like the quality of the cocktails definitely justified the price and i would happily pop back here for a few pre or post dinner at one of the many restaurants at the shore
did i come here for indian food
no
i came for cocktails
but i shall return for an indian feast
as part of the yelp cocktail quest
headed up by the cocktail queen robyn z
we were in leith and ready to get our cocktail on
our original plan of bond no was dropped when blythe suggested mithas one of the best indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
who recently opened a new cocktail bar
my curiosity was peaked
and what cocktails they were
it's a small bar area
and it was empty on a wednesday night
they mixed me a margarita tout de suite
and it was perfect
it's hard to do a margarita above and beyond the usual excellent
but it's easy to get it wrong
and i find its a good way to judge a place on its skills
this was a great margi
so i knew we were in good mixologist hands
the rakput
was a muddled raspberry and vodka affair
that was garnished with a whole chilli and also had chilli in the cocktail
you could really taste it
in an pleasant way
and not chilli syrup or 'essenence of'
but real chilli
by the third cocktail i'd gotten into a very interesting discussion with julie g on japanese feminism and the rest of the night is a blur
the cocktails were that good
i have heard only good things about the food
and given its mainly a restaurant and i've yet to try their food
i can't give it stars just yet
but i will return to try it all
and will leave time to visit the cocktail bar first before my meal too
right
i've been back to try the food and just wow
definite stars from me
jenny l and i arranged a girl date so we could dine and drink and belatedly celebrate her new job and what better place the mithas
from the moment we walked in til the moment we left the service was impeccable and the staff so friendly_and_helpful
i love the design of this place
dark work with splashed of bright colours
the tables are set a good distance apart so you don't feel like you are on top of the people dining next to you but there is still a good atmosphere and buzz from the room
the menu is well laid_out
with a few set menu tasting menu options and also an a la_carte menu to choose from
we went a la_carte ordering the scallops and crab cakes for starters and a lamb_curry and roasted duck dish for mains
i apologise as the names of all these dishes is long forgotten
thankfully not the taste though
before our starters arrived we were treated to a little mug of spicy tomato_soup that was delicious and warm if a wee bit on the spicer side for me
starters arrived in good time and the scallops came in their shells with a delightful sauce and the crab cakes with a nicely dressed side salad
we spilt everything and i have to say it was all delicious
the crab cakes especially as they were full of crab and really well blended spices that were both warming while also giving a slight kick at the end
they were washed down well with our cocktails
mains arrived next and were just outstandingly good
i've eaten a lot of curries
but these were just so above anything i'd tried before
the spices were well blended and so flavourful the duck and lamb was super tender and everything just made my mouth happy with a palate of spice
warmth
and general deliciousness
although we were getting full
we did struggle to eat the majority of the meal because neither of us wanted it to go to waste
also we managed to squeeze in dessert
jenny the poached pear and me the seasonal dessert of warm chocolate cake with liquid centre
all delicious with cinnamon and hazelnut ice creams
overall an incredibly amazing meal
the prices are a bit higher_than you'd pay for a normal indian
but well worth it
i cant' wait_to_go_back
i'm wavering between a and a star really in this case
there isn't much in it
by the time i stop writing you will know which way i went
i've been curious to try mithas for a while it's definitely going for the fine_dining edge and service is efficient
brisk and detailed
we
unfortunately
didn't dress for the occasion
but thankfully were not turfed out for such insolence
now
this review
being during the world cup
will be a tale of two halves
first half food
one of these days i'll return for the tasting menu
i think that will be fun times
first
we were presented with a drink passionfruit and pomegranate i think
the waitress forgot to tell us
and we forgot to ask
it was lovely
nonetheless
it came with a selection of dips that could be matched with our starters tomato and beetroot
spiced tomato chutney etc
they looked lovely
but i was so engrossed in the starter
i clean forgot to try them
for starters
we split the vegetarian platter it was a little awkward
as everything came out in 's
but there was three of us
but
apart from that
the food itself
as my fellow diner commented
was a really refreshing change
with nary a deep_fried dish in sight
fried paneer with a spicy edge
a cake made of yam
for me
too soggy
spinach cake stuffed with figs
my favourite
and mushrooms
also stuffed and spiced
too spicy for me
next up
mains
chicken for the silent reviewer
south_indian prawn curry for the divine ms m and for myself
baby aubergines
again
the aubergine was a little too spicy for me
and my tastebuds died in a spice overload
but the prawn curry was lovely
creamy
and formed a tasty contrast to my dish
we also had the bread basket
i've had better naan elsewhere
but they were ok
and pilau_rice
the portion_sizes were good as well not excessive
nor too small
that we all finished up satisfied
dishes were not greasy either
another win for mithas
overall food was lovely
well cooked
and cooked fresh
so you do have to wait
and nicely presented
next time i'll have to ask to tone down the spice to make it more palatable for me
and that stars will go up to
second half drinks
alright
so we had had a couple of wines before entering
and if we hadn't
we probably would have been much more behaved on the drinks front
but boy
i'm glad that our inhibitions had been cast aside
because we made the right choice
even if my head did hurt a little this morning
the divine ms m and i both opted for the cocktail sampling menu
poor
poor sober silent reviewer was our designated driver
this menu more than matched the food menu
five cocktails for twenty pounds is an absolute steal as well
especially at this level of quality
starting out with a watermelon and vodka aperitif
ginger
crushed watermelon and vodka
was a winning start
every flavour was nicely balanced and outrageously good
it was then i met the love of my lift that evening
a girl can have many
many loves of course
hazelnut and sparkling wine just hands_down phenomenal i would drink that forever
this was swiftly followed up with a jack daniels martini from the coolness of watermelon and sweetness of hazelnut
it was a shock to the tastebuds
but a good one the abrasiveness of the whisky tempered by the mixologist
involving pineapple
to a much more smooth level
then onto the red salute a fruitier
sweeter number with lychee that had been the original draw for me but actually more forgettable than some of it's predecessors
finally
a guilty pleasure a creamy frothy number with jasmine tea that just tasted like a boozy chai_tea
a dreamy way to draw our way to a close and for us to pour ourselves out and into the car home
the cocktail tasting menu was technically supposed_to_be served at the bar with bar snacks but we didn't notice that when we ordered
and got it anyway
as the waitress first warned us you will have shots and ml of sparkling wine
so please me hearties
do not drink this menu and think to drive
summary
food stars
but more like
going on
cocktails
for me were the best cocktails i have ever tasted
the remaining were worthy runners up
stars
service
stars
nice even when the restaurant was closing up and we were the only ones left
alright you got me this is stars of deliciousness
a fantastic way to spend a saturday_night
empress of india is far and away the best indian food in k w
i have tried a number of other places around here and they don't come close
i've grown up eating indian food on a regular_basis
including going to india for it
and believe me
this is as close as you'll get to the real deal in k w
often times people are daunted by the sheer number of things on an indian menu
and this restaurant is no exception
to get you started
i recommend trying their veg pakoras
tandoori_chicken
amritsari fish
dal_makhani
garlic_naan and chana
that's a fair bit of food across the board to get you going
the atmosphere is nice and cozy
it gives the feeling of a traditionally cooked meal
rather than a pre packaged commercialized food experience
now
i know lots of people who try indian food for the first time are worried about spice
and not to worry
the food here is not too hot
i have brought many people here who are
noobs
in the indian food world and they absolutely loved it
and left with their tongues intact
and their bellies full
this restaurant is excellent if you want great indian food whether you want to dine in the restaurant or take it back to your dorm
it is a little pricey for students
but the quality is well worth the slightly higher expense in my opinion
i have only ever tried their vegetarian curries
however these have all been excellent
their paneer tastes light and fresh
and their chickpea masala is delicious
with just_the_right_amount_of spice
they have an excellent selection of tame to hot curries
though you're not going to find anything too intensely spicy
if you dine in the restaurant you will get complimentary papadum with two tasty chutneys
the servers are very helpful and polite
i'm very happy that they seem to have replaced whoever was constantly burning the naan
kids took me for father's day
yummy stuff
i normally do not like to eat fish except sushi
but i'd go back in a heartbeat for the amritsari fish
fresh halibut marinated in garlic ginger paste
lemon juice
special indian spices and deep_fried garnished with salad and lemon
also had the veggie pakora
samosa
naan and the tandoori platter
other mains were the chicken_korma
lamb_vindaloo and dahl
while i wasn't wild about the tandoori platter
everything else was excellent
especially the lamb_vindaloo
excellent value and capable
attentive service
can't wait for my next visit
mattar_paneer is my go to dish at indian_restaurants and empress of india makes it pretty well
i've tried the channa_masala
vegetable_korma and the vegetable_samosas and all are quite good
it's hard_to_find good indian food in waterloo
most places i've tried in the area have fairly tasteless and watery food
empress of india is not like that
if you're a student
flash your card and they'll take off
i learned this after the guy ringing up my order saw my watcard in my wallet haha
this is a true little gem
i am perhaps the world's greatest critics of indian nepalese restaurants as i know what i like and they often don't live up to my standards
i've got my favourite restaurants that i frequent and i do often try others but of the time i leave disappointed
i'm very happy to say that when i went to the gurkha cafe this was the other
i was anything but disappointed
the interior of this place is really cool
it feels like you're in a little hut as it has open wooden beams all over the ceiling
i felt as thought i'd taken a plane east by just stepping through the door
the interior really does set the tone and makes a lovely change from other restaurants_in_edinburgh
i saw someone at the table next to me drinking a nepalese gurkha beer so i decided when in rome
it was not a bad beer and went well with the food but for
for mls it wasn't so cheap
worth it for the label though
i went for the mo mo cha nepalese chicken dumplings to start and you could choose this either steamed or fried
i went for steamed and was so glad that i did as they were delicious
i was a bit apprehensive but they were very tasty
they were crescent moon shaped and there were lots of them i'm sure i had at least and was full after the starter alone as they certainly didn't scrimp on the portion_sizes
what made this dish though was the sauce that accompanied it
i couldn't work out what was in it and it didn't say on the menu but this was a tasty little number
i want to say it was mustard as that's what it looked like but i hate the stuff so know it certainly wasn't that
no_matter_what was in it
it was divine and just pushed this dish over the edge and into the exquisite category
my companion had the chicken satay to start with
this wasn't the usual asian chicken satay that you'd normally expect as this was with a nepalese twist
the size of this dish could have easily passed for a main_course
there were huge chunks of chicken under a rich
tomato barbeque style sauce
as i said
not like the usual peanut style satay but still good
not as good as my dumplings though top tip
another good thing about this place
to add to the huge list
is you can specify how mild or how hot you'd like your meal to be so the dishes really are made to your specific requirements
for main_course i ordered the chicken_korma
when ordering in fact
i asked the waiter what he recommended by telling him what i liked
i know a lot of people think
'boring old korma' but this restaurant gave this dish a new lease of life
the tastes and flavours in this dish were phenomenal
that's what i love about nepalese even more than indian_restaurants
they use even more herbs and spices to create the perfect flavours
yummy
again the portion_sizes were very generous but it was so tasty that i couldn't stop_eating until i'd finished it all
my fellow diner had the chicken garlic and chilli if i remember correctly
it came out still cooking on a hot plate and the colours of the dish made for great presentation
the quantity as well as quality of this dish was unbelievable
we could have easily shared this alone without starters and still left full i'm sure
she only managed a quarter of it as it was
as i said above
although this dish is made with chilli she asked for it to be mild and it suited her just perfectly
we ordered rice and a peshwari nan to go with the main_courses
the nan was lovely
lighter than most nans which was a good thing considering the amount of food and it came in a basket cut into pizza style slices
this place really does have it all you can't get a more central location
the highest of quality food with flavours bursting in every mouthful
good friendly service and a different yet cool interior
it's a winner
as if you can't tell already
i love_this_place
take whatever i've written and imagine i love it more then you'll be getting a bit closer to understanding how much i enjoyed this meal and now love this restaurant
honestly
the only thing left to say is try it for yourself
i'm sure you_won't_be_disappointed and if you are then you can always take the left_overs away for me
no complaints friendly_staff
unforgettable food
the flavours are so deep and intense
i love it
go for the lunch deal really good value
the first time round i got the dal_makhani
which was delicious
and the second time i got the rajma aloo which was equally good
i wish i could go back but i don't know when i'll be in edinburgh again
we started with chicken momo
they were good
a bit like a curried ravioli
the sauce tasted a bit like a spicy tomato pasta sauce
making it seem even more like a twisted italian dish
they were good
none the less
i got my bhuteko khasi
lamb
as hot
and it was a bit spicy but not nearly what i expected
the taste was great for this dish
we also had the rasilo chicken which
at medium_spice
was not hot at all
i preferred my lamb
hungry
want to leave edinburgh and go to a hotel for dinner in kathmandu
in gurka cafe you will think you have arrived
quality service
homemade authentic nepalese food
italian but better with chinese influence
they guy cant do enough for you
i think next time i go i will ask for a camel steak just to see if they manage to find one
they managed everything else when i took a group of fifteen crazy americans there
a credit to your nation and an asset to edinburgh
the staff were great and didn't push too hard in that way that indian_restaurants sometimes do to get you to buy more food
i found the lamb achari not spicy enough
even at hot level
the vegetable_korma was a tad sweet
but all overall good
they're great for large late parties
even ones with an extra people who unexpectedly turned u after the rest
our group of had one of the best meals here
and i think it's safe to say the best meal we had during our stay in edinburgh
the staff were absolutely delightful and only added to the experience
this would be a regular place for me if i lived nearby
trying to find a meal late at night
we ducked in here and got one of the best meals of our trip
not perfect but pretty damn close
excellent spice
decent heat when ordering
hot
nice service
funky atmosphere
i've never had nepalese but i've had scads of indian
it was delicious
check your bill
they charged use for a pickle tray we said no to
it's only a
but still
i'm glad i caught it and they fixed it no problem
khushi's has recently moved here from victoria street
and it's easy to see why it's doing so well
yes
it's true that edinburgh has more than it's fair share of easy on the pennies indian_restaurants to choose from
but this place definitely ranks among the better ones
even just from walking past the door
the smell alone makes you hungry
it mainly caters for groups of students it's the obvious choice for sports teams on their nights out or birthday meals
largely because they don't charge any corkage for bringing your own wine and beer
spirits aren't allowed
if you're not boozing
then you have to try their home made fruit juice creations
i went for the cucumber
mint and rock salt
and although it sounds more than a little bit weird it was actually really tasty
the carrot and orange was a close second place
the starters will set you back each
and you could do a lot worse than the sunhari jhinga
king prawns fried in spiced batter
crispy and amazing
the mains range from
although they're not hugely imaginative all the predictable dishes you'd_expect to find on the menu in an indian place
being predictable
however
doesn't stop them from being delicious
i have a bit of a grudge against khushi's in its old incarnation of victoria street a kitchen fire burnt down one of my favourate bars next_door
so grr
anyway
me and a party of others turned up to khishi's to celebrate with a curry and a few drinks with the bring_your_own bottle policy that they have at khushi's
the restaurant is suprisingly big
being able to easily cater to such a huge group and it is really modern looking inside
which is a nice change to other indian_restaurants i have been in
the staff were incredably friendly
helpful and just generally nice as well as being excellently efficient and fast as we ordered from our menu's
which had a large selection of traditional and modern indian dishes
when our food arrived i was over joyed it tasted fabulous and the portions were the perfect size for me
sides such as rice and naan were also great
if a bit small and stingy
anyway
khushis's has more than made up for burning down that bar by providing great food
good atmosphere and an excellent night overall
after a dramatic burn down of this large restaurant on victoria street
they reopened a smaller version quite close to the university central campus
it's still managed to keep its good quality indian food
i am a particular fan of the chicken bryanny and added to this it there is a byob policy with no cork free
on rugby nights or weekend nights i would suggest you book in advance
also don't give in to the sometimes pushy waiters who want you to order more than you want or make choices too fast
also the low ceilings make it quite noisy so sit in the lower room if you get a chance
this is yet another four star because kushi's is pretty good
the fact that it has a byob policy makes it ideal for big group meals prior to nights out
i came here with a large_group of friends once last year on a friday_evening and the place was heaving with both floors full and roaring noise
the service was pretty slow because of this and we were waiting for at least minutes for our main_courses to arrive
i opted for the lamb bhuna with rice and a plain_naan which was delicious and the portion was ample for a night on the tiles
my friend ordered the tandoori_chicken which just about blew her head off with the heat of the chillies
most of their mains cost about and the sides are all pretty well priced
making it a relatively cheap evening out
khushi's offers great food in a lively
comfortable atmosphere which is ideal for a fun
tasty group meal
deep flavour
not at all greasy
just fanastic food
very nice good service
patient
even with a group of knackered drunken but not rowdy designers
inexpensive
and byo
what's not to like
khushi's has been serving indian food to edinburgh residents since
so is woven in to the fabric of the city
this new place sticks to their tried
tested and trusted formula
overall
we said
this isn't a new restaurant at all
it's the same old khushi's
if you like it
and loads of people do
you're going to be delighted with this new outlet
for me it's ordinary and doesn't provide anything fresh
it's so well established in the edinburgh dining consciousness that i'm confident it will continue to be a successful business in its new location
i can't see me paying a repeat visit anytime soon
though
as it lacks any spark to raise it above being merely ok
despite living in edinburgh for almost years
i hadn't made it to any of the infamous khushi restaurants so decided to pay a visit for my birthday night out
i had a booking for people
for a two hour slot
and was quite surprised at just how busy it was for a week night between christmas and new years
the khushi reputation clearly drives a great trade
having made an
executive
decision to dine from the christmas set menu
pp
minimising the agonies of making a selection from the vast a la_carte and the squabbles over
who had what
when it came to paying the bill
i was very impressed with the selection
and quantity
of the offering
a pre starter of pickles and popadoms kept us going while we waited for the last few of the party to arrive
followed by a variety of starters including the typical chicken_tikka
onion bhajii and pakora
the main_course selection included a tender lamb jalfrezi
tasty fish_curry and chicken_korma
served with rice and naan
there was something to cater for the taste of everyone
it was a perfect way to try a selection of different dishes
the food was served buffet style and there was plenty to go around
i'd be surprised if anyone could have managed dessert after such a feast
coupled with the byob offering with no corkage charge
the night was a success
great value_for_money
my only niggle would be the constant reminder from the waiting staff of the two hour booking slot
not only to me but also to some of my guests which i felt added an unnecessary sense of urgency to the experience
will definately visit again to dine from the a la_carte menu
bah
you know when you keep giving somewhere just another chance because it used to be good
well
i think last_night was the night i gave up
i used to love khushi's in victoria street
it was a dramatic building
and i had some great food there
then it burnt down
and they moved to a fairly boring cellar under the pear tree and i don't know
seemed to lose their way
sauces were boring and tasted 'out of a jar'
and worse
the staff would positively force feed you to get you out fast
but i reasoned to myself that i had gone during the festival and at christmas
and nowhere is at its best when it's so busy
finally
khushi has its new home
in antigua place at the top of leith walk
it's taken over a big space that used to be massimo's
i miss massimo's
and from the outside it looks bright and cheerful and the place to be
so last_night i called and asked for a reservation for four
they had a table
though we'd have to be out in minutes
that seemed fair
we just wanted a quick meal
from the second we arrived
though
it all went wrong
we were shown into a bare 'overspill' room off to the side
harassed to order fast
and then the unsmiling waiter announced that he'd 'bring your starters and mains at the same time
because you have to be out soon'
charming
and so he did
slapped everything down and off he went
to practise his lack of social skills on someone else
the food was okay
i suppose fish pakora were tasty
the veg pakora a bit dry for my liking
my tandoori monkfish i've had it before there and loved it
but last_night it was a bit overcooked
and
maybe not actually monkfish
the texture just wasn't quite right so i was suspicious
anyway
we ate
we got full
mostly it was basic british indian food in over creamy sauces
and we were finished long before the time they were due to throw us out
there are too many good restaurants_in_edinburgh to have to put up with actively rude service
i've had enough
and won't be back
q
what did the inflatable headmaster say to the inflatable student in the inflatable school
a
you've let me down
you've let the school down and you've let yourself down
that's how i feel about my visit to khushi's
what a disappointment
i really liked the old khushi's on victoria st
unless i'm looking back with rose tinted taste_buds
certainly the building was beautiful and lent the whole experience a degree of elegance
well
at least as much elegance as you can muster while staggering up the stairs clutching your plastic bag overflowing with byob contributions
i have fond memories of the food there but it seems a long time now since that place burned down
what's happening with that space
anyway
i went once to their temporary location where the food was bad and the service worse
i wasn't sure if i wanted to go back but since they opened their new restaurant at the top of leith walk
it looked more stylish and back to the original vibe
i was sad to see massimo close down though
as i was impressed both times i went there
i guess i should have gone more often
but it's a funny location at the top of the walk
kind of on the way somewhere but neither here nor there
intermediate but not central
as we say in the geography biz
it works for the cheap and crappy indian
and other sub continental
and italian places there who grab the pre theatre cheapskates but it's not an easy location to make a go of a high_quality
and matching price
establishment
so
the new place looks nice from the outside
but inside it feels a bit more like a pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap kind of place
and that's how they treat you
see gillian's review for more detail
we knew when we booked that we only had minutes
which was fine
but they really rushed us and not in a friendly way
it was just rude
and he told us the starters would come with the mains because we had to be out
didn't ask us
or make it friendly or anything
come on
how long does it take to cook
serve and eat a few pakora
as it turned out
we finished with plenty of time to spare
the food was decent
quite reliable quality but nothing out of the ordinary
and continued rude service throughout the meal
q
there are so many good indian
bangladeshi
etc
restaurants_in_edinburgh
why would we go back to a place like this
a
i think you already know the answer
i was very dubious about trying khushis again
i used to be a dedicated follower and must have gone at least every couple of months without fail for years
until the old restaurant opened on victoria street that is and the quality of the food as well as service just went straight down the hill
the last time i went i had a disastrous meal involving raw prawns and a chicken bone which although the head chef himself came out to see what was going on as he could see that we were not happy
instead of helping turn out experience round for the better he just decided to conceal the evidence and walk away without so much as an apology
needless_to_say i never went back
however
i don't hold too much of a grudge and am willing to give out second chances so when the new restaurant opened on antigua street i pondered over whether to try it or not
i have to say though
i'm definitely glad i did
although i was nervous when walking through the door the friendly_and_attentive staff put me at ease quickly
this setting is lovely
although the other one was really swanky antigua street restaurant has still managed to keep that element alive but with a more cosy atmosphere rather than the cold and open feel the old place had
the ceiling is full of glass lanterns which fill the place with colour and sparkle
that's not the only colourful thing about the place though
the new and improved menu is amazing they have far more fish courses than i remember and the baltic curries come in a clay pot with an indian bread lid which look delightful
the quality is back up to scratch and the prices not half bad either for curries ranging_from
but lets not forget about the deal breaker here it is bring_your_own bottle and one of the only b
y
o
b
s in edinburgh that doesn't charge corkage
your purse will thank you so go for it
in yet another incarnation khushi's is now on the site of what was previously an italian called massimo's whilst the burnt out branch on victoria street is on the market
having only ever eaten in the defunct one once about years_ago comparisons are probably pointless but one thing that did strike me was that the range of dishes available seems to be smaller nowadays
i imagine you could get a vindaloo if you asked for one but that and a few other types of curry don't feature on the menu it seems so you might want to try elsewhere if in search of something particularly hot
possibly that's a sign of authenticity
either way the party of i was in with on saturday past had no complaints about our respective dishes
the knowledgeable speedy service or the highly sensible policy of not charging for corkage
not maybe the place to go for a quiet and intimate tete a tete but you could do a lot worse in most other aspects
the food was excellent but the service was abrupt and rushed
could have spoiled what was a brilliant evening with friends
was recommended to this place by my friends who are actually from india
i expected authenticity and wasn't let down in the food department
the place is dimly lit and nicely_decorated to reflect its heritage
which reminds me
i really must find chandeliers similar to the ones found in khushi
they are very pretty
the portions are small
which makes the prices appear slightly steep
the food
we had naan and lamb_biryani
tastes pretty decent
but my friends didn't enjoy the service and the staff as they put on too much of a
show
i thought it was manageable and let that slide
all in all
if you have the right company and are craving_for_indian_food
this place is pretty ok
okay overall nasty burnt garlic in sag paneer
big points off
but naan was good
mango_lassi was great
the sign on the door about beer wine was confusing i thought it meant they had only beer wine and no cocktails
but it actually means there is no alcohol you can bring_your_own
but only beer_and_wine
the decor is very nice
i've eat a grat fish
fresh
a good curry
bread and fresh and cruncy salad
the weiter was polite and useful
he knew all his dishes
clean place
floor and chear
good service
thank you
giuseppe
whenever i walk past this restaurant
it is always packed
i have always wondered why
now i know
it was a friday_evening and my friend suggested we have dinner here
we were offered a
booking and the restaurant was already full when i arrived
a waiter asked if we wanted poppadoms to start with
sure why not
they were accompanied with dips
mango_chutney and a spicy onion dip
real kick to it
i had a mixed_grill for my main_course
it is a mixed platter of chicken_tikka
prawn
lamb chop and seekh kebab
the chicken_tikka was my favourite i didn't know chicken can be so melt in the mouth stuff
the platter came with a simple chickpea salad and we shared a naan_bread
the service at times felt a bit rushed
i'm not sure if this is because they really are so popular
e
g
a couple could not get a table as they had no reservation
and it was a friday
howerver the food was nice
khushi's has a byob policy and no corkage charge which possibly is another factor to their popularity
lamb kahrahi was amazing
very busy night during hogmanay week yet we got seated quicker than originally stated
garlic_naan was excellent
while they don't serve alcohol they do allow byob and will supply glasses
visiting from california we came across khushi's as we wandered around the city
the pakoras were great and flavorful but the three veggie mains we had were spicy
hot
but otherwise bland
the service was inconsistent and impatient
it's a bustling place
we asked for advice from the waiter on the size of the portions yet still ended_up with too much food
perhaps it is popular because they let you byob at no charge
so if i lived here i might give it another try but i would imagine there are better options for indian food
i'm telling you
restaurants in hotel lobbies are totally underrated
don't believe me

this is the third restaurant in the tandoori_times family
i haven't been to the other locations
but based_on the reviews for those establishments
tandoori_times ranks right up there
admittedly
the place was deserted last_night
but i'm told it's hopping on fridays and saturdays when they bring in belly_dancing and hookah
the decor is completely new
the holiday inn has also been recently renovated
it's comfortable
spacious and has a modern feel
the manager whose name escapes me at the moment was also our server
she is pleasant
funny and her presence alone will guarantee my return
any server that is willing to engage in friendly banter is okay in my book
lastly
the food was excellent
should i have said that first
ha
i can't_speak intelligently on indian_cuisine
but suffice it to say that i enjoyed it very much
and fried cottage_cheese is now one of my major food groups
check it out
great and flavorful food
plus friendly service
being close to my home and office
i have been to this joint quite a few times and its high time i put in good words for the great quality of food and the amazing friendly service that they provide
i am a vegetarian they do have many veggie_options
the ambience is great
a cool mix of modern and traditional_indian interior
the lunch menu is also good and very filling
for the dinner menu too their servings are large enough for two
ask for spicy food and they'll make sure its the way you expected
the staff_is_very_friendly
nargis
freva and sussanna
all are very lively
they have some good collection of wines too
i'd love to try out the bar some day
i came by this restaurant one evening as i was having a craving_for_indian_food and this was just a couple of miles away from my home
i got the mango_lassi
the tikka masala paneer and paneer battered in some gravy
i wish i could remember_the_name of it
here's the breakdown
service is really quite good
i went in and took a couple of minutes to pick something out
the girl at the hostess' table was attentive
and whilst waiting multiple people stopped by to make sure i had been taken_care_of
she made sure to bring the mango_lassi out to me first
as well
which was nice
the tikka masala was delicious
spicy and with a depth of flavor that was awesome
the paneer was chewy
and could have been tastier
but really
why would you want to compete with the sauce
the fried paneer was perhaps the most mediocre of the punch
as mentioned before
the paneer by itself was a bit unremarkable
and the spices and the tangy tamarind dipping sauce it came in wasn't something to my preference
not awful
just not my favorite
it was also a bit rubbery
but we all know fried things don't travel well
my biggest gripe is that
when i got home
i found out they hadn't included rice with my order
i'm sorry
but that is not good
i need rice to eat with my tikka masala
i could have made some of my own
but that rather defeats the purpose of take out
not a deal breaker
but definitely left a slight sour note in my mouth
if you order take out make sure to request rice
my first time here
food was great
large portions at a good price
great looking place too
super clean and nice
had an outdoor sitting area with misters as well
service was great
so friendly_and_helpful
our servers last time we fariba and sayed and couldnt have asked for better staff
i will_definitely_be_back here
oh and they had a great belly_dancer to see on this saturday_night while we ate
good addition
classy place located at the holiday inn
the chicken_makhani and chicken_tikka_masala were exellent
i had both dishes at tandoor and
but this place tops all
very well seasoned
thick rich and creamy with tasty herbs
meat was juicy and just right
rice was consistent in texture
a gal in braids served us
she had a foreign accent and was very awkward by tring to be overly friendly
but i'm sure she was just trying to be friendly to her patrons lol
i think she was a n b
but i realized this place opened not too long ago
so she's likely still in training
i asked her for a to go container for my makhani and masala
and she came out with one of those sandwich containers
had to send her back to fetch a soup container bc the sauces will leak and make your car smell like indian food for days
i would say i was impressed with the food
not quite san jose level
but close
i would def go back again if i drop by hat side of town
if it were closer to home and more affordable
i'd eat it every day
d
first off i think that everyone reading this needs to go show them some love
there were only two sets of diners during lunch the day we were there
i'm not saying it's perfect but it was quite good
we had a groupon which made it a great deal
the prices were good for the groupon but otherwise a bit steep
the service was excellent and my coconut curry chicken was very good
they charge you for rice
which is a bummer
but the rice was very flavorful by itself
portions are adequate and mine was extremely tasty
my companion was not as impressed with her food
she got a vegan dish which had to be remade due to chicken broth being used
the server caught it and had it remade
however
she asked for it to be on the spice scale and i could eat it
and i'm a wuss
my dish was supposedly a and i was fine with it
so i don't understand their scale for hotness
overall it was a good lunch
just not sure if it was good enough to go back for
wont be back
ridiculously expensive
bad service
and tacky decor
despite our waitress forgetting to bring drinks until we asked for them minutes_later
the food tasted good
wish the portion_sizes were bigger
my boyfriend and i ate here last week
the experience from the start wasn't great
we were seated and no explanation was given as to the menus left on the table
there was a giant menu that had no more than a dozen or so items and a bunch of alcoholic beverages
we were confused and disappointed as we could really only identify one or two items
the waitress
who is also the hostess
dropped off additional menus
we were relieved until we saw the prices
yikes
a bit more than we anticipated based_on my previous interpretation of the number of money signs
next we waited
and waited
and waited
it took over minutes to get our drinks and an order
when we reminded the waitress
she seemed offended
as if it was our fault she forgot
then
to top it off
we find out the two dishes we ordered
were exactly the same
why couldnt someone explain this before we ordered
one was just
spicier
the twin dishes were good
but i was a little peeved that i just spent close to for two of the same dish
i probably won't go back
it's not that the food wasn't good
but i didn't feel that we got good service
and i paid way to much to not be treated well
and in regards to money spent
it wasn't so much price per dish
which i now realize i was misinformed on
but it was the quantity we got for the price
i would definitely not ever come here with a bigger group
location i loved
not to far away from where i live
it's located right in the holiday inn parking_lot and is pretty big inside
as soon as i walked inside for this friday_night dinner i noticed the place was pretty empty
i like the vibe of the place
it feels really clean and modern with more of an upscale feel from other restaurants in the neighborhood
the waitress was super_nice and really gave top_notch service throughout the night
they have a full bar with some really good deals during happy_hour so i took advantage by trying one of the mixed drinks they had listed
forgot which one sorry
but it was yummy
no skimping on the alcohol either
i had the lamb special for the evening and my husband ordered the chicken marsala
we shared plates and the food was just ok to me
i like things spicy and felt it didn't meet what i liked
as we were leaving we got a huge surprise
a belly_dancer came out to entertain everyone
loved the show
location
and service
amazing food
i wasn't so sure about indian food
as visiting this place was my first time at both the restaurant and the food itself
i had the chicken_tikki marsala and it was fantastic
i can't_wait_to_go_back
this place is terrific
we have been here times now and have tried many dishes
all are very good
they have a great happy_hour from and belly_dancing on friday and saturday nights
if you like indian_cuisine or have never tried it
give this place a shot
very good
friendly service we had coconut curry prawns
chicken_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
saag with cheese
naan and rice with veggies
all were good
i've eaten lunch during the work week two times
the first time was about weeks_ago
and then today
both days happened to be thursdays
the first time a friend from india
who now lives in us
brought me here
she's a vegetarian and i asked her where she likes to go for indian food in the area
normally she would make her own lunch
the second time
today
i brought an american friend who really likes indian food
similar to myself
the food is very good for an american like me
i like flavorable
medium hot spicy foods
i order
medium
here on the spice scale
and they get it right for me
i could use a bit more heat spice
and they do have two
hotter
levels than medium
but i would rather err on the side of caution
i've asked for medium hot in the spice dept
but have been informed they don't have that category
their heat scale is something like no spice or light weight
medium
hot and flaming
i made up those words
i can't remember the names of foods i've eaten
they were delicious
chicken spinach dish
curry chicken dish
salad
garlic bread naan
rice
lentil soup it's all been quite good
service
decent
first time i came it was less than decent
today it was decent
one waitress didn't describe or communicate that well
another waitress was quite friendly_and_helpful at the start of the meal
overall
nothing to rave or complain_about
food
delicious
especially for what i imagine is an americanized indian food restaurant
i don't know of any truly authentic_indian_food restaurants in arizona
several of my indian friends enjoy the food here
and i've seen large groups of indian co_workers at other tables both times i've been here at lunchtime
i'll keep_coming_back for occasional lunches
though it's extremely filling to eat here and then go back to work
ambiance
outstanding for me
if you want traditional_indian decor
this probably wouldn't be the place for you
it's the cleanest
brightest
most modern indian restaurant i've ever been in
very nice decor that i happen to love
it has not been busy at all both times i've been here
which makes it nice for parking and for finding a good table
maybe it's busier in the evenings or on weekends
great atmosphere and service
very clean for an indian restaurant
food was enjoyable
chicken_tikka a bit dry but still good
was not sure about this place at first due to location
but definitely glad i went in
just as delicious as tandoori ii
but way fancier
we went on a friday_night and if we had been blindfolded in the way over i would have sworn we were in scottsdale
the food was awesome
the building beautiful and the patio with firepits and heaters and hookahs are a great addition to the ambiance
if you have not tried indian food before
this is the place to do so
the tikka masala and naan and fragrant rice are all great beginner dishes
the only reason i am not giving stars is the service was pretty damn slow making us miss happy_hour specials
i will say though
the belly_dancer and music were rad but it made some of our party feel awkward as we didn't know if we were supposed to stop our conversation to watch and tip
all in all
this is a great place
an indian restaurant inside a holiday inn
if it were anything but tandoori_times i might have thought twice before trying
i've only ordered takeout
but the food is as you'd_expect if you've eaten at either of their other locations
which is to say
its good
the decor of the restaurant is modern and upscale
but both times i've picked_up takeout the place was almost completely empty
if you show up and this is the case
don't be discouraged
the food is good and their bar looks fully stocked
this place is attached to a holiday inn but do not let that fool you as the food is amazing
the lamb_vindaloo and the garlic_naan and the saag gohst are some of my favorites
the complimentary chai_tea tastes a bit like hot half half
but what do expect for free
stars
the naan
was great
the paneer tika_masala was average
but the mint_chutney that had been sitting so long that it fermented and was carbonated really scared me
lunch_specials range from this is not a lunch buffet
they do include hot chai_tea which is nice
the location is a bit odd as this is the restaurant for the holiday inn which if i were on travel for work i would be happy to find
the inside is nice clean and modern but service was sub par as we had to ask to get our water refilled
luckily i was not in a rush
lunch was oddly slow
with other tables at the peak
i really like this place
i have been there so many times they know us
i have to say my favorite things are on the happy_hour meny
you order a few things off that and you are done
i always get the lamb kabobs
they have a pretty nice selection on beer_and_wine
the staff are all very friendly
they have a belly_dancer on the weekends which is fun
if you want to dine on really good
reasonably_priced indian food
this is the place to go
the dining_room is spacious with contemporary indian themed decor
the ambiance is casual and upscale at the same time
the servers are very friendly
and the entrees are really tasty
and if the weather is good
you may even want to dine al fresco at the spacious patio area
my husband and i love indian food
we have eaten here times now
we have a restaurant that we always go to and wanted to see if there was anything better out there so after having driven by here a few times we decided to stop in
the same waiter has served us all three times and the service has always been slow
even when there are no other diners
the food was really really good the first time we went
we had the chicken_tikka_masala and the sauce was incredible
extra creamy and thick
the next two times we went the food was just ok
it seemed as though the sauce had been watered_down a little and that was a real shame
all in all i would wish there was a little more consistency in flavorville so we could look_forward to a delicious meal everytime
been here many times now and this place is delish
we always get the chicken_tikka_masala and then try something new each time we go
the friday chef special goat is fantastic as is the lamb_curry
an the garlic_naan is a must
most authentic_indian_food outside of india
i know
because i've been
don't let the idea of exotic food scare you away
there's something for everyone here
even vegetarians and children
try the paneer
pressed cheese
dishes or samosas choley if you don't like meat
try the chicken or paneer makhani if you don't like the heat
for medium spicy dishes
the chicken_tikka_masala is excellent with a side of rice and naan_bread
if you want a bite of something that'll bite you back with a really great flavor
try the tandoor fish wrap
the key to eating reasonably is to go as a group of or more
get rice and naan and a couple different items to share with the entire table
you don't have to drink alcohol
but there's a full service bar at all of the tandoori_times locations and the beer_selection is above_average
this is the newest of the locations and features a large inside area with an amazing patio
complete with firepit and hookah
bellydancers join the fun on friday and saturday nights
decent value if you crave very good quality food
an exotic atmosphere and an authentic indian experience
ok
the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic
but it's definitely exciting
one of my favorite weekend hangouts
solid out of
so good
if it was less expensive
i would be back more often
almost
not including tip
for app
side
entrees
and non alcoholic drinks
loved the grilled shrimp
curry dishes and garlic_naan
amazing food
we were a bit skeptical
but this place was really great
we had a groupon
and our service was outstanding the naan was great
and the entrees were spectacular
excellent service and wonderful food
i totally suggest trying the tandoori wings appetizer
they are so good that i daydream about them
so i'm finally caving in and writing a review about tandoori_times
the food is excellent
but pricey
i took a friend for his birthday and it cost me just over for the both of us
the night we went they had belly_dancers and amazing eastern music
the music was a little bit on the loud side
i had never seen a live belly_dancer and i was totally impressed she worked the room and it wasn't at all uncomfortable
my friend really enjoyed her dancing and the music too
the only reason i'm not giving this place stars is because the wait_staff really sucked
you guys really need to get it together in this area
i read some of the other reviews and this is a common theme for you
i will visit this place again
but if the wait_staff hasn't improved i will re rate this place and never show up again
the service_was_a_bit_slow even though it was sunday_night and there was hardly anyone there
they forgot my drink
my first drink took about mins to appear
the food was good though
naans were great
so was my lamb_vindaloo
we had the spicy tandoori wings for appetizers
and my golfing buddy had the aloo_gobi which was great
irish the service were more prompt and i would give it four stars
chicken_tikka was amazing
food was really good
i wish there were more server but i would recommend_this_place
i sat for minutes without being greeted_by the waiter
no drinks were offered
i left after expressing my dissatisfaction to the hostess
thanks for the terrible service
the sign looks like it could pass as a preschool
needless_to_say i was skeptical
after trying it today i couldn't say anything bad
the food was outstanding and the atmosphere is very nice
lamb and coconut chicken is recommended
called in my order and it was ready to pick_up when i got there
chicken_vindaloo is delish
the best chicken_tikka_masala
i love their garlic_naan and their rice with peas is delicious
prices are a little steep for india but the quality is very good
the staff is super_nice which is always a pleasure to walk into
the restaurant is located on the side of a hotel
it is very nice
brand new and very comfortable
their is actually an individual tv at each booth which would be perfect for bringing kids or a spouse you don't like
the tandoori wings appetizer was ok
probably wouldn't order it again
however the chicken_tikka_masala was the best i have had
i will absolutely return for that
i did not like that they charged extra for rice
the garlic_naan was amazing and went really well with the tikka masala
our waitress was fantastic and there was a busser water person that kept us comfortable while she was away
they also had a really nice patio but it was pretty dark outside
this is a pretty good indian restaurant
a the reviews say the garlic_naan is a must and i agree
the pompadom are light and the chicken_tikka_masala has just right bite
overall i was quite pleased prices ate average for this type of restaurant
we really love here
i've lived in india for a half year
and sadly
i like it more here
we always order paneer_tikka_masala with garlic_naan
really good
on lunch times we also like to order lamb seekh kabob
we also tried tandoori_times but i would give
stars there
even though it's a bit further than it's worth_the_drive
it's really weird that there are only like customers everytime i visit
i wonder how they make money
the food is star
everything is flavorful and presented nicely
tv's at every booth
good for children
only negative is staff can be slow and sparse
the paneer marsala is very rich but mild though not a problem just ask for more kick and they will gladly adjust
restaurant is connect to
hotel so i believe there is wifi
also the restaurant never seems more than full
which is a plus for me due to children
honestly it the best tasting indian food i have tasted in the valley
so far
everything is a la cart
this place is a hidden treasure
hidden behind in a hotel restaurant space it can be kinda hard_to_find the first time
my personal favorite dish is the goat_curry friday special
bring a few dollar bills after
because a beautiful belly_dancer comes out in the evening
when the weather is nice you can dine on the patio
the food is very good and the service is tops
they also have a full bar
i went to tandoori_times through word from a friend that the food was amazing
i was very hesitant considering i had never tried indian food before
we were seated_right_away and it seemed to be getting busy so it was perfect timing we got a booth against the wall
our waitress greeted us right away and informed us that happy_hour was about to end at so we got our first drinks in happy_hour
she was very friendly when we asked about some of the items on the menu she wasnt sure of some the answers so she called man over
im assuming the manager
and he gave_us the whole run down of the menu
let_me_tell_you what
if you have never had indian food before you are missing out
they recommended the chicken_tikka_masala and garlic_naan
amazing
i dont know how i have never eaten here before considering i live right down the street
it is a little hard to see and hard to get into but we will for sure be coming_back here
overall great experience and excellent food
we were not impressed
we purchased a groupon and the server did not inform us we couldn't apply it towards our happy_hour purchases
we read the groupon once we got our bill to check and yes that is on us to double check the fine print
but a friendly reminder would have been nice since we told_him ahead of time we were using a groupon
even though we were one of only four tables occupied it took over minutes to get any water or for the server to acknowledge us
the chicken was was over breaded and tough
the naan was good except for the way over burned edges
drinks were ok
and dessert was inedible
overall not a good experience or food
just ate here for the first time
and loved it
the food was amazing
the server recommended the chicken_makhani
and he couldn't have been more right
lunch_special comes with a side salad
rice
and a generous portion of naan
the server was very nice
let come in and have a seat minutes before they opened so i didn't have to wait i'm the heat
will be back for sure
i ordered the combo tuesday special with lamb achari and chicken_makhani
it comes with dhal
rice
side salad and naan
i upgraded the naan to garlic_naan
the makhani was better than most i have tasted
the lamb achari is delicious
it's creamy and spicy and the lamb jut melts in_your_mouth
definitely coming_back here
the food here is the best
the garlic nam bread and chicken_tika_masala are so good i crave them
last_night i tried bawarchi
a little hole_in_the_wall
fairly new place on bell road
the place is clean and attractive and has a reasonably_priced menu
we saw that most of the clientele was ethnic so it reasoned that the food would be good
we started out with two meat samosas made with ground lamb
not greasy and full of meat flavored beautifully with fragrant spices
enjoyed it very much
they were accompanied_by coriander chutney and a tamarind spicy mixture
don't know what that was
we also had chicken_vindaloo
chicken_biryani
lamb_chops and naan
the chicken_biryani was accompanied_by lentils and yogurt
the yogurt was amazing as were the lentils whose flavor profile included coconut
the lamp chops serving was ample but the lamb was chopped into pieces
my eating partner said they tasted good
the vindaloo was very good although not as spicy as i had asked them to make it
restaurants are afraid to add too much spice until they get to know you
everything was great until i decided to order the kheer
for dessert
i like my kheer with raisins and i asked if it had raisins to which they answered yes
no raisins in the kheer but i found it to be very strange
at least for me
i have never ever had kheer with noodles in it
meaning
kheer which is a rice_pudding is usually made with basmati_rice
well this one had noodles as well and i i did not enjoy it
since it costs only
i did not make a fuss
if i had paid over
i would have returned it to them
when i got up to pay for the kheer
because we had already paid our bill
the owner did not want to charge me for the kheer
maybe he read my mind or my stomach
i resisted the temptation
not to pay
and insisted the owner take his money
i do want them to stay in business
it is a family_run business and it shows
i don't have a problem eating off of paper_plates with plastic utensils
if this bothers you
this is not the place for you
by the time we left at
pm
the restaurant was almost full of patrons
obviously
the word has gotten out that there is good food to be had here
seeing all the indian families eating there is further proof that the food must be seasoned and prepared authentically
i thought so
we really
really enjoyed our meal bawarchi minus the kheer
great food
i was in from out of town and i've recently become a vegetarian
they had a great selection of indian food for me and my carnivore friend to chose from
i highly_recommend this place and will come here again the next time i'm in phoenix
excellent chicken dum_biryani
andra chicken curry which was also very good
highly_recommended
so happy to see another indian place pop up by my house
bawarchi is a no frills
very casual
authentic little indian restaurant
menu is small but covers most of the basics
we had naan
aloo_gobi
palak_paneer
and my hubs had a chicken curry
the aloo_gobi was not my favorite
i feel it was mostly onions with very little cauliflower and potatoes
it wasn't bad
but i have had better at most other indian_restaurants
the naan was very good
so was the palak_paneer very yummy
creamy
spicy
perfect
my husband really liked his chicken dish
i like that the entrees came with a very generous serving of rice
some indian places either make you pay extra for rice or only give you a little bit
i am disappointed that they recently raised their prices on everything
the picture of the menu you see on yelp is not accurate
in fact the menu they gave_us with our order had the prices crossed out and the raised prices written in
classy
but the prices are still excellent and a much better value than other local indian_restaurants
we will be back
again and again and again
i waited for atleast visits and dishes before i wrote this review
i believe we have a winner
go to this place for the food and food alone
this is not a place for dining out
neither the location nor the ambience inside point to that
it is great for take out
they serve pretty quickly so not much of a wait
prices_are_reasonable
the staff is friendly and the food is tasty
i have had the daal
aloo gobhi
andhra chicken and gosht biryani
all good
i will be back to sample the rest
the best place for chicken dum_biryani
other non_veg dishes are good
menu is small but covers most of the basic dishes
very cheap also
highly_recommended
great place to pick_up quick indian food in the north valley
my wife and i stopped by here last_night after reading the other good reviews_on_yelp
seeing the great prices on the menu
and feeling like watching a movie at home with good food
we ordered chana masal
aaloo gobi
and vegatable biryani
all three had excellent flavor and spices
the spice_level is pretty high
which is fine by us but if you are not into heat you may want ask if they can tone it down
the biryani came in a bag
which was new to me but i wonder if that might be typical of take away curry in india and europe
although i've never been to india
this food seemed more authentic than other restaurant in the valley
keeping that in mind
you may want to watch for spice pods
curry leaves and whole chillies in the dishes
as the food is less processed than you may be use to
it is good to have this new place for indian
which offers great veggie_options and meat options as well
great prices with quick and friendly service
may be a bad day to get chicken_tikka kebab
chicken kebabs looked like they have been sleeping for days in the freezer and then got a chance to get into the plate what they call kebab
heard the biriyani is good there
but i think i am not in a mood to try my luck again
no frills ricey indian
meh
great spot for that sweet mango yogurt drink
wishing they were still in tempe
magic lost since the move up here
stingy on the meat
if they run out
they'll give you extra rice
what
i'm not an_expert_on_indian
but that rice is soggy for my taste
my indian friends say it must cook for hours to absorb the flavor
but they also say it should not be mushy like that
but that mango yogurt drink is a mean
sweet
beautiful thing
go for it
wishing that when you ask for a on the spiciness scale
that they'd give it a bit more effort
we found this place back in early may
posted a picture some business information on yelp and look how quickly this took off
this place isn't gourmet
but it definitely hits the spot
thanks for opening a really good indian place in the neighborhood
the tikka masala and makhani are kind of runny compared to tandoori_times
not as thick
but the owner is kind
good customer_service
my fav is the mango lasse
chicken_tikka_masala and chicken_makhani are my favs
i always call in my orders beforehand
convinient to go place
but always remember to check our food before you take it home
more like a fast_food concept
food is made to order
like dosas
samosas
etc
big_fan of their veg and non_veg biryanis
true andhra style
was disappointed with their medhu vada
i have had tastier vadas at other restaurants serving south_india vegan food
small restaurant floor
i guess that helps in faster service
i've been to most places in phoenix
and this the only place in town where u get real biriyani
in the name of biriyani many cook masala rice
i would definitely recommend them for any mughal cuisine
dirty
dirty
dirty
i can't understand why people tolerate this sort of messy place
some food items were rather good dosa in particular
but the majority of the ones we had were extremely oily compared_to_other places for the same dishes apps
their prices really aren't much cheaper_than full service places either
and it's hard to see why it is worth the savings
filthy dirty shame
this place won't make it on good food only
this is the filthiest restaurant i've seen in many years
i've been three times
and the filth is no fluke
it's a standard here
trash is overflowing
food served on filthy food trays
dried food and crumbs on tables that only need to be wiped
filthy
dried food remains in a tub above the trash that also overflows
nothing is ever wiped down
trash on the floor
mold on the fountain nozzles
last visit
they were out of ice
out of ice
all this filth
and the guy that runs the register is rude and is either eating at the register
standing with his hands in his pockets
or sitting at a table where his laptop is a fixed feature
i think if they replaced this guy with someone that will do the job
they could fix a lot of their problems
i've_never_seen him make an effort other than take an order
which he has trouble getting right as i've noticed people get food they did not order
their food is terrific
but this place will eventually be shut down by the health department
they've received bad reports in the past and made no effort to improve
it's a real shame
this place could be so great
so easily
we won't be going back
the food here was good
we really loved the naan
we would have given the place stars
but we knocked it down a star because the price is a bit much for a vegetarian meal and counter service
the vegetarian_options were around the same price as the meat options
garbanzo beans and lentils are much cheaper_than lamb and beef
andhra chicken curry and palak_paneer r the best
best place for dum_biryani in phoenix
in fact best biryani i have even had in this country
unfortunately other restaurants all have their own versions of biryani and call it as traditional dum_biryani
my friends have taken me to good biryani places so for some reason i don't think this was the best biryani
but i don't know if what i've had was dum_biryani or not
tried the chicken one and it didn't have the flavor i though
maybe all those times it wasn't truly authentic or from a dif region
they give you a lot of rice though
not a whole lot if chicken but you'll find this under all the rice
had the chicken_tikka_masala too and liked the flavor of the sauce
ordered two mango_lassis
the first one came out about minutes after we got our food
not before
the second one came out about minutes after that one
the guy told me the lady was making them in the back
it was a bit strange on the timing but tells me that there was literally one person in the back doing the main cooking
cleanliness
i am by no means a germ a phobe and rarely bothered by how a place looks but there was something about this place that didnt sit right with me
not sure what but i noticed it
i thought the reviews were over reacting but for once there is some legitimacy
thankfully i just let it pass
i will warn you though that the owner or guy at the counter is not so willing to give up his to go containers
i asked for a second container to replace the sauce container we had bc it had gotten really dirty
the guy started pointing to the container and muttered something before finally giving it to me
funny
despite all this i will be back
there are some things on the menu that seemed more local to the region that i don't see at other places so would be great to try them
what do you tell a kid who's got two a's and one c in a semester
you can't commend him for his performance nor can you give him grief for performing badly
after all two a's do count
don't they
and this is what i thought when i got down to review the bawarchi indian_cuisine
on one hand
this restaurant provides the most authentic andhra hyderabad food i've_ever_eaten to date in the phoenix area
on_the_other_hand
there are things like cleanliness
service
quality etc
you get the point
which matter
and it is here that this place falters and it falters badly
but the food
especially the biryani and andhra chicken curry or the lamb_chops are very good and very true to their taste
i can't comment on vegetarian food but i believe it won't be very off
so if_you_are_looking for some real authentic andhra hyderabad food
then i think you should head to this place
but then for the reasons mentioned above
you shouldn't hesitate to take a carry_out
self service restaurant
food is ok
you can try once
you will not find smile on the owners face
no cooler hot like hell
not clean to expected standards
inexpensive food
restaurant is crammed
it's more like a
pros
good chicken_tikka_masala
pretty good naan
yummy samosas
spicy but not too spicy
very reasonably_priced and good for takeout
friendly service
cons
the dal curry had a strange consistency
echoing some of the earlier comments the restaurant isn't that clean
also not a germaphobe and have lower expectations for hole_in_the_wall mom_and_pop shops
but still seemed like it wasn't clean enough
my rating is for the food not the place to eat
get take out
little or no ac
the chicken and lamb dishes were good but the bhindi was dry
i will likely go back and pick_up take out but i would not eat there
great takeout
love the chicken_tikka_marsala
we're fans
i admit it
biriyani is my weakness
i can fold for a good plate of spicy biriyani any day and bawarchi serves just that
if you are there for the food
do not be fooled by the mediocre interiors although the setting is a bit homely for someone from south east asia
if you are a meat lover go for the mutton biriyani or if a vegetarian
vegan biriyani with lassi will soothe your craving
i cannot vouch for the other items in the menu but i will surely visit the place often for i always walk out with a smile on my face
quality is down and i hate to see this happen
mutton biryani is my favorite and i used to order one every friday
i noticed lately that the meat content has gone down significantly
now i have to order two biryanis to get the quantity equivalent to one
this makes it very expensive compared to others
i am on my quest to find a better biryani place
their andhra chicken curry is still the best in the valley
ordered a chicken_vindaloo for takeout
when i got home
it was in a small container which was mostly sauce maybe slivers of chicken
it came with rice but i will tell you that i will never do this again
it wasn't enough to eat even as a lunch
so disappointed
i was a fan
i got the chicken_tikka_masala and the garlic_naan bread
everything was all right
nothing super fancy
the chicken had clumps of some spice that i couldn't tell you what it was
however
i wasn't pleased with that as it was an overpower explosion of spice in a few bites that i discovered those
the naan_bread was rather rubbery and the garlic tasted sweet
to be honest with you though
it did taste really good and for the price that i paid
i would definitely return
my husband and i are a regular at this place
it was very good and very spicy
it has several vegetarian and vegan_options
food is was good and cheap
everything else like customer_service
cleanliness etc is
multiple_times i them to separate out the potatoes in the dosa for take out so it doesn't get soggy
they do it the time and the other half i get a dirty look if i make them do it
sometimes they will forget to give the items that come with the order in take out
since the younger guy showed_up the quality and quantity of food
esp
the biryani
has gone down
this is depressing because the food initially was incredible good and price was cheap
with they few changes they could have been the indian restaurant in the area
in short
the best hyderabadi biryani
s
chicken dum
sp
chicken
goat and fish
in phoenix
don't even bother about the rest of the menu
details
one of my hot spots to have biryani during my stay
in phoenix
pros
very tasty authentic hyderabad style dum_biryani
s
i would also recommend the spicy andhra chicken curry with garlic_naan
cons
it's a poorly maintained spot
zero points to ambiance
menu is very limited to a few dishes
the owner is short tempered
be careful and don't poke him
lol
packing is poor
many times they miss packing the sides
pay
wait and eat
starts coz a restaurant cannot be rated start just on one menu item
d
if_you_are_looking to dine in with some elegance this is not the place
if you want to feast on possibly the best indian food in the valley you have found the place
channa_masala was delicious
garlic_naan is fantastic and the chicken_tikka_masala is great too
you cannot go wrong with this place but be prepared for a plan b as this place will sometimes randomly be closed
try to call ahead if you can
it's usually a good indicator if everyone behind_the_counter making your food is wearing a sari
this is a very good
authentic_indian_food place
i also like that it's a walk up counter
so you don't have to tip the waitstaff
they have tables there but i usually get my order to go during lunch and it's always pretty fast
i like the dal with garlic_nan or butter_chicken
it's nose running spicy but it fills me up and warms my soul
aaaaah
we arrived
pm
the door was opened with a chair
and the owner was laying on the chairs with his feet up on the table
in the dining_room
on the phone and told us they're closed until pm
i can't say anything about their food but i can say their service is atrocious
good luck to those who come here in the future
i hope they clean the tables for their guests sake
the food is mostly pretty good
not a place to dine in
small stuffy and hot
with the hot oil burners in close vicinity to the seats
the biryani chicken curry are good
paneer mattar
ie
cheese with peas
is a waste
you get pieces of paneer floating in curry or if you're lucky
being in scottsdale
decent indian food is hard to come by
so this little hole_in_the_wall stands_out
it is on the spicy side
which is great if you like that
the big plus is
they recently opened an indian grocery_store next_door
they have a good variety of spices
daals etc
best biryani chicken dum that i ever had in az
the taste is authentic
garlic_naan and chicken_makhani are good too
anyway
i highly_recommend chicken dum_biryani
if you really want to try the authentic_indian_food
this is the place
price is reasonable too
i can only comment on the non meat portions of the menu
but everything is very good and spicing levels are seemingly authentic
everything is quite creamy buttery when ordered
like dosa
samosa
and the curries
and therefore quite rich
their masalas
chutnies
sambar
etc
and curry sauces are all quite good
naan is medium sized
i would recommend methu vada
idli
masala_dosa
if you like southern_indian foods
the sambar is very good with it
navaratna koorma
aaloo palak and some of the best among veg curries
biryani is good
but i am used to singaporean malaysian tamil style where they serve on a banana leaf with a bowl of curry_sauce
and without this briyani always seems dry to me
though theirs is quite good for this style
rice_pudding is inexpensive
and very good
when available
counter cafe style
well spiced recipes for a mostly indian clientele
quick service
very well priced
finally a great place for curry near me right off the
have gone here several times and always impressed
i cant waiver from the chicken_tikka_masala and garlic_naan
but thank god my gf gets the palak_paneer so i can get another awesome flavor change
i am yet to see another white person in there when i go so you know its authentic
but very clean and professional
small inside so we normally get it to go and there has never been a mistake made
great food
inside seems a little crazy when busy but manageable
will definitely_be_going_back
i go to this place regularly because i love hyderabadi dum_biryani but getting a fresh biryani is like winning a lottery
when ever the biryani is fresh its very good and nice flavour and i love it
but mostly on weekdays he will serve you two days old biryani which definitely microwaved food because the rice and meat is all dried up
when you ask the owner about the biryani
he is defensive and says its always fresh
i never tried anything here except biryani and on weekends mostly its fresh and good but on weekdays you must be lucky enough to get fresh biryani
chicken_biryani is awesomely spicy
i lucked out and had a regular give me some tips on what to order
try any one of the naans as well
you_won't_be_disappointed
food is good
i usually take chicken dum_biryani which is really good
high street
old town is one of those touristy places you sort of expect it will be difficult_to_find decently priced and good food
it is usually one of the two you get
so
real rajput was a very good find
you don't see much from the outside
but it is a large room downstairs
the eggplant_dish i tried was very good
but the lamb karahi was one of the best dishes i have tried while in the uk
the service was also good and fast
and did i say it was not expensive given its location
great night out on the royal mile
the staff here are the stars of the show but the food isn't bad either
as you would expect on the edinburgh royal mile it was a little more expensive than an equivalent quality restaurant elsewhere
the staff are the stars because they provide a relaxed and friendly atmosphere for your meal
very attentive but not at all overbearing
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful
an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc
my only word of caution i found is to visitors to edinburgh in general
when they say hot up here they don't just mean hot they mean very very hot indeed
first off
let me say we went with a group_of_people
this pretty much took up half the dining_room
and most of these were loud chatty college kids
the wait_staff and manager were very accommodating and the service was very
very good
the tandoori grill items were amazing
i would highly_recommend them
they came out on a platter still steaming and smelling delicious
the same way people bring you fajitas in the states same thing
between four of us guys we got each one and swapped and shared
they were all super good
we had each of the varieties of naan as well
all were excellent
the chicken_biryani had very generous amounts of chicken chunks in it and the rice was fantastic
i'd recommend a plate of that to share with your friends while you get a grill item
this was our last supper together as a group before heading back to the states the next day
and it was a perfect way to cap off our trip
good food
good friends
great service
very accomodating of a large_group
and well priced
i'd highly_recommend stopping in
note to self
edinburgh restaurants close early
we realized it was
pm
so asked hotel for a reco
that said
we taxied a few miles out away from the royal mile
headed for italian
dario's i think
our driver said to try another italian restaurant across_the_street but i saw the kama sutra sign beaming thru the rain and had remembered it scored high on trip advisor
indian actually sounded good
so we gave it a shot
the greeter waiter comedic hero seemed surprised but pleased to see us
he seated us quietly aside from the two other patrons
menus
wine please
navinder
he had to spell and pronounce for me
told us the specials and i asked for his recos
during this time
we chatted up and after we mentioned we were from ohio the talk rounded up to
hello cleveland
quote for quote we went on spinal tap
i love him
back to the food
i had a special starter
the scallops
which was the only low point of the meal
a little overlooked so despite the rich indian flavors
a little hard going down
from here out however
everything else was fantastic
man had the achari bathak tikka duck marinated in indian spices
divine
not gamey and very tender
we split a plate of chicken stuffed dosa
plain nan and another special monkfish that was deep_fried
surrounded by potatoes and other steed veggies
oh my god
delicious
man ate most of the food while i gabbed with the staff
by this time
navinder was joined by another server
the owner and the chef
we ended_up staying on much longer talking_about everything form the city to marriage to movie trivia and closed the place with a special drink concocted by the second waiter
i remember him mentioning elderberry something or other
the chef was the sweetest man alive and truly interested in our feedback
the owner was hilarious
just a joy to chat with
i particularly loved his take on how important service is
he also knew every movie i threw at him
rushmore
come on
that's impressive
we got pix with the team and received a nice send off as we headed back in the rain to our hotel
sated and silly from a great night out
highly_recommend this place and their original spot in glasgow
one of the best dining experiences ever
wish we could transplant them back to the states
hello cleveland
good food and very friendly_staff
i have been back many times
best butter_chicken in the whole wide world
on our recent visit to scotland
we stayed at sheraton
just as we stepped outside the hotel
we spotted this indian restaurant
across_the_street
we ordered chicken_korma paratha for dinner
when the chicken_korma arrived on the table
my husband asked the waiter for some hot_sauce in order to spice up the dish
like most indians would do
the waiter went back
and instead of the hot_sauce
arrived a very polite cordial gentleman alok singh
the manager of the restaurant
seeing we are indians who might not prefer a mild dish like chicken_korma
which we had already ordered
he asked the waiter to take the korma away from our table
he proactively offered to order a dish of butter_chicken to us
we both were a little startled
embarrassed but definitely appreciated his gesture eventually
great customer_service indeed
once the butter_chicken arrived
not only did my husband not ask for any hot_sauce this time
he heartily enjoyed the lip smacking dish and inferred this is
the best butter_chicken i have ever had
he meant he had never even tasted anything close to this flavorful dish
even in any restaurant in india
we couldn't help going back to kama sutra on the following night for dinner
and no prize for guessing we ordered cheese_naan of course
butter_chicken
despite its name
there are not a bunch of people hanging out here in precarious sex positions
instead
there are a bunch of people hanging out here eating delicious indian food
i
too
ate some of this delicious food and have to say i'd definitely recommend it
nom
i tried this bizarrely named indian restaurant on my last trip to edinburgh
note
over a year_ago
and was delighted with the food
drinks and service
the interior of the restaurant was beautiful
spacious
well lit and not at all sleazy or as wacky as its name suggests
the menu is a nice change from the standard indian_restaurants one finds in europe
from what i recall
some of the staple indian curries were available
but most of the dishes on offer would be relatively unknown to the non indian diner
this encouraged me to try something new
nope
i can't remember what it was now
and i wasn't disappointed
the waiter knew some of the options were a bit unconventional
and gladly answered all the questions we had about level of spicyness
comparison to other dishes
etc
portions were slightly small and prices were slightly high considering its location
yet the great service made up for it
we arrived at the restaurant late
and after our meal asked if we could order drinks
the waiter explained the restaurant was closing but he would keep the bar open slightly later so we could have some cocktails
such a nice gesture
and i recall the cocktails being fantastic
i will_definitely_return on my next visit to edinburgh
i have the honor of writing the first review for this new restaurant
it has been open for just over a week now
the decor is your typical
new
indian restaurant strip_mall style
dark woods and a nice clean appearance
the table set up is certainly set up with the lunch buffet crowd in mind
not a bad thing as there is plenty of space around each table
service was fast and friendly with even the chef stopping by our table to check on us
as of now
they do not have a liquor license
but they did say they expect to get it in the next couple_of_weeks
the important stuff
the food
if you have read any of my indian restaurant reviews
we tend to stick with what we know and like
though today we did go with a chicken_korma and butter_chicken rather than chicken_tikka_masala and just for a change
an order of the aloo palak
well
honestly
it was good
very good in fact
the sauces were some of the best i have had
certainly better than origin and slightly better than mt_everest
the only negative would be the amount of chicken used
let's say it was light in this area
add some more meat to the dish and it would have been a home run
the aloo palak was good
i am not a big_fan of this dish
but the wife loves it and she raved_about this version
the naan
plain and garlic
were superb
a little thinner than i normally like
but boy a simple dish done perfectly
so all in all
a good place to eat
certainly the best indian on this side of town
i went to this place at the last minute w my gf who was craving_indian_food
both of us love indian food very much and have been to many of them
this was among the best we've been to
first the food
which is probably the most important aspect of any dining_experience for me
you can have bad service and great food and reluctantly find yourself going back from time to time
but a place with bad food and great service is less likely to be revisited
the food was absolutely_delicious
you have to try the chicken
or something like that it has a number in the name
it's an appetizer dish with chicken that appears to have been marinated and then cooked in a batter or something
idk i'm not a foodie and i don't know all the intricacies of how a dish is prepared
all i know is that it was damn good
i had meant to get a dish to go on my way back home the next day but forgot
the other dishes were almost as good way better than standard
but not quite as exceptional as the appetizer
for spiciness
we got which was just perfect for us
we like it pretty spicy though
so for people less tolerant
you might want to dial it down a bit
service which i think is the second most important in any dining_experience
was phenomenal i would say it was pretty close to an all time best for me
we had sat_down and since my gf is the foodie i let her pick the dish while i proceeded to check something on my phone
as soon as i whip out my phone
the manager comes and asks if i need access to the wifi
which i gratefully accept
the rest of the evening is just as attentive
friendly
and considerate
i don't have time to go into all the details
but all of the staff were extremely pleasant
and attentive
they are also very international which i really liked a lot
there were indian staff of course
but also caucasian
eastern asian
and other ethnicity as well
india
which has historically been a major fulcrum of the silk road is well represented by the people working here
it was an absolutely delightful dining_experience
adding another dimension to the tasteful decor and immaculate ambiance
it almost makes me not want to leave a good review in fear that it will be over crowded the next time we visit
but the people working there really deserve every bit of the praise
i wish i had more time and the descriptive capacity to do them justice
but you'll simply have to experience it for yourself
ps
i rarely ever do yelp_reviews btw
but this one i really wanted to do
this is hands_down the best indian restaurant in town
went here for both lunch and dinner and was overwhelmingly satisfied each time
lunch
they're lunch buffet is huge
with
i was given a selection of items
dishes
is usually standard in any indian buffet
in an indian buffet is unheard of
and it gets better
what makes india_masala stand out from its competitors is that besides having nearly triple the quantity of dishes to choose from for less than
you're always in for a surprise
unlike other traditional indian_buffets
the items on the buffet at india_masala change everyday
some traditional items such as chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori_chicken
dal makkhani etc
remain
but for the most part
dishes change each day
also
it features both north south_indian dishes in their buffet
in the end
best indian buffet in vegas
dinner
when i step into any restaurant
there are things i stick my neck out for
food
ambience
service
the food is phenomenal
my friends and i ordered a family dosa
its a big big crepe about feet long
also
i had the chicken as an appetizer
lamb madras curry
and garlic_nan
chicken was highly_recommend by our server
it didn't disappoint
it was a dry red chicken
the flavor was quite different and thus hard to explain
all i remember is that each bite felt electric
literally
lamb madras curry was also great
i ordered a spice_level and it was perfect
the curry had a great depth of flavor
ambience is very beautiful
as for the service
this restaurant knows what it is doing
they're service is outstanding
i'm going to start off letting everyone know how i found out about this place
these people are the same people as the india_masala in the riviera hotel
i have been going to that one since i found out about it and they told me about it this new one and i thought why not lets give it a try
my friend and i decided to check out there buffet which is
a fairly decent price for having choices ranging_from north_indian curries to south_indian curries and even indo_chinese thrown in there as well
also
for a dosa lover like me
they offer it in their buffet
i had tandoori_chicken
pakora
chicken_tikka_masala
of course
goat_curry
fish_curry
curd rice
avial
a south_indian dish
which was pretty good
tamarind rice
rasam
a south_indian spicy tamarind soup
raita
and obviously naan dosa
okay so all of it didn't fit in a plate
i had to make a couple rounds
and even though my friend kept making fun of me
i felt satisfied for the i had spent
overall
for an indian lunch buffet this place surpassed my expectations
i'm usually very hesitant when it comes to going to indian_lunch_buffets because i've had a few bad experiences here in vegas but this
my friends is a safe and sumptuous choice
my friend and i have decided because we enjoyed this so much and because of its proximity to campus
unlv
we are going to come at least times a week because we were assured that they will have varying items every day
the staff is very nice and helpful as well but like i said earlier we went to a buffet so we didn't have as much interaction as you would during dinner
we are planning to have dinner there sometime soon because they have such a huge menu
so i'll keep you all posted
beautiful delicious
i always crave indo_chinese food but had not come across a place that serves these options in vegas
for this reason
i was really excited when i learnt that this new place had opened and had a groupon out as well
indo_chinese is basically the indianized version of chinese_food
as in india we like to spice everything up
the place was busy with people at the restaurant as well as several take out orders being fulfilled
we were seated without delay and got water
they soon brought out a complimentary papad with types of chutnety sweet tamarind and coriander and both were yummy
the server informed us that they were backed up in the kitchen and it would take minutes to get our food
so we decided to order a veg samosa to share
the samosa was pretty nice
she soon brought out the veg manchurian i had ordered and this was really good
d ordered the veg thali which was huge and came with veggies bhindi
okra
masala
alu matar
potato and peas curry
black dal
raita yogurt
papad
lots of rice and fresh baked naan_bread
it also included a mango achar relish and a desert seviyan
which is a milk based desert like kheer but with vermicelli instead of rice
i tasted the desert and it was super yummy
the good thing about the thali was that everything looked home made and was not dripping in oil
the desert reminded_me_of desert i ate at home in india
the service was great
our glasses were never empty and our server checked in with us each time she crossed our table
all the other helpers and servers were also very customer oriented and everyone at the restaurant looked happy to be there
i am excited_to_try their south_indian dishes and will definitely go again
i was suspicious about the great reviews
but being a lover of indian food
had to find out for myself
don't believe the hype and fake reviews
while the interior is nicely_decorated
the food quality and selection is mediocre at best
they have about selections and not the items that another review claims
surprisingly
they lacked the standard staples of lunch_buffets like pakora
samosas
saag
and even kheer
while the naan and chutneys were ok
the currys and dahl were subpar
they tasted watered_down and lacked the spice and complexity that they ought to have
according to their_website
they were supposed to have some indo_chinese type dishes in their buffet but those items were completely absent
for dessert
they had some weird vermicelli served in a warm and sweet milk
reminiscent of kheer
but not tasting very good
regardless
now that i know better
i'll be sticking with my tried and true favorites
i
e
mt
everest
i have no idea who writes these reviews
but this place has been waaaay overrated
friends
maybe
i am indian and have been on a endless search for the best indian food
still searching
i figure if a place can do a decent indian lunch buffet then they atleast serious about cooking authentic_indian_food during non buffet times
i went for the lunch buffet
which i admit must be mildly seasoned to broaden customer appeal yet can't be too costly for the restaurant to make a profit
but i expect flavorful seasoning and variety
everything was underseasoned
not enough salt or hot spice
there really was none
the buffet had the appearance of being bountiful because of the meat and vegetables were in the front buffet
it definitely captivate the eyes and stomach of customer
however once at the buffet i found it not logically flowing once at the buffet
it does not flow logically
which would be flowing from appetizers and papadums
to rice
noodles
and breads then veggies and meats
here the buffet started with plates
tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka
fish_curry
daals
vegetable curries
all very soupy items that probably should have rice or a starch served first so the sop up the gravies
in addition
too much repetition
proteins fish_curry and types of chicken
tandoori
wings
tikka
and curry
daals
and batter fried vegetable and cheap starchy filed vegetable dishes
a gobi filled with chana and a
vegetable
curry dominated by potatoes and peas
not reflective of the delicious quality vegetables dishes indian_cuisine has been admired for
no paneer
as a vegetarian source of complete protein instead of another chicken dish
furthermore
a very disjointed buffet offering
sambar without idli or dosa
mint_chutney and tamarind_chutney without samosa or chaat
come on
you give the facade of bounty
but it is incomplete
you know better
but undermine true indian buffet fans in order to cut costs
there are a ton of indian_buffets that are better for the same price and most are around you
while this commonly happens at most buffets
it seem to be with every gravy dish
all the
good
stuff was gone and it seemed once it was finished
it was finished
yet coming at pm and the buffet is from
to
pm
i do expect it to be replenished
but didn't see it happen in the minutes i was there
understandably the dishes were mild
but there should be some
hot
sauce condiment offered
i didn't see any
but i also never asked for any
out of all the dishes the tandoori_chicken was the best
it remained juicy yet it was still underseasoned and definitely not cooked in a tandoori
one of the more promising things about the restaurant was that the atmosphere was
nice
and up to date and most_importantly the service was way above par of most indian_restaurants
as an indian it is rare to get treated as well as
non indian
customers
here our_water_glasses were never less than half full
and they appropriately checked on us from time to time without fussing or discriminating
came here for the lunch buffet
and left satisfied
the place was moderately busy and had a nice selection of the usual buffet selections
there weren't as many veggie_options as i would have liked
but the options offered were all pretty fresh and not overspiced
our server was nicely attentive and unobtrusive
refilling water glasses with a smile
this place served as a welcome oasis to begin the new school year
within a four mile radius of the university is a plethora of indian_restaurants
india_masala is another to add to the mix
but it tends to fall short compared to the others
they serve a lunch buffet from
for
price wise
it is similar to all the others
where it falls flat is in the offerings
im offers a variety_of_dishes that are not often seen at other places
the vegetable_korma is a primary example of this point
it was the one i enjoyed the most
the well seasoned mix of mushrooms and potatoes with the mango_chutney gave a balanced taste of sweet and savory
the rice in the chicken_biryani was also decious
it was soft
pillowy
and flavorful
i scooped around the dried chicken pieces and went with the tandoori instead
most of the time
it is best to pass on the tandoori because it just sits out and loses all the moisture
not theirs
instead
i found it to be tender and moist
other than those three dishes
i was not impressed
the service
on_the_other_hand
was polite and friendly
the decorum
spacious and warm
with so much potential
i hope to see them tweak the menu a bit more
i wouls like to come in for dinner and just order ala_carte
it's about time i found a truly good indian restaurant in las_vegas
the chicken_tikka_masala was delicious when paired with their perfectly_cooked garlic_naan
slightly crispy as well as soft and chewy
tried the goat_curry which was nice and earthy
my date thought some parts of the meat were too tendony but i surmised that it's because when cooking such an unusual meat
they probably used most parts of the animal
my only true complaint was that our waiter pretty much forgot to take our order and no one else came by our table in a long time
there were only other tables being served at the time
we didn't get to eat til about minutes from the time we sat_down
i'm willing to forgive this hopefully one time incident because of the surprisingly good food
i was treated to a spectacle of the family sized dosa being served at the next table
it was huge
can't_wait_to_come_back and try it
hands_down
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
being a las_vegas resident and having eaten indian food across the world
i can honestly say that india_masala is an absolute winner
the interior is plush
comfortable
clean
and well built
from the moment you walk in
you feel that you are transported for a dining_experience half a world away
i think what knocks out the competition are the unique and flavorful spices
spices i have never tasted before
the entree melts in_your_mouth and wanting more and more
the menu has everything you could ask for in an indian restaurant
and the service was top_notch
i was also shocked at the outstanding prices
basically
i cant wait until i have the chance to eat there again
recommend for any occasion without hesitation
awesome hospitality
very clean
joseph
nicole were serving us with great hospitality
being vegetarian and indian too
we know the taste of indian dishes
we ordered papadi chaat
idly sambar
rasam
and uttpam
all there taste excellent
one note
if you love spicy
and real spicy you need to say
try pista kulfi as dessert
sambar
and coconut_chutney was not that great but it was just ok
wasnt hungry much so tried only appetizers
did not try any main_course
definitely we will come here again
awesome place
this place is beautiful
the decor is classy enough for date_night
yet not so over the top that you feel under dressed at lunch
it is as all buffets should be
clean and neat and well_stocked
we came here after a disappointing stop at ghandi the week earlier
the service here is wonderful
very nice and friendly also mindful and considerate
full water glasses at all times
we were offered fresh naan_bread and it was great
the mango_lassi was affordable and generous
i do not know what is expected of indian dishes officially
i only know if like what i had or not so please keep that in mind
the first time we went we loved it
there were large chunks of chicken in the butter_chicken and an amazing lamb_curry
kessla
dessert which was over the top
we loved this
lemon_rice and unique vegetarian_dishes i gave a try
well cooked basmati_rice
tandoori_chicken
soups
pakora
the second time came around and it was also great
the chicken curry was amazing
told friends
then came a third time and
hmm
things changed
butter_chicken had tiny thin strands of chicken not at all the same kind from before
there was no lamb_curry which was disappointing to me
and some dishes that looked good but had bones in them including the chicken curry
the first time it was made without bones
i personally won't eat any gravies or curries with bones
there was a mango dessert that was unique
i never tried the salads and smaller items
by the time i make it to the back wall i am full i did not count how many items but there is surely enough to choose from
so we would prefer more consistency in quality as customers
however that's the only issue we had here
no one got sick
nothing bad happened it was a pleasant experience
the place is really nice and deserves a shot
i never had dinner here and i am dying to try the cashew chicken
we'll go back thats for sure
i'm not a fan of indian but this place was as good as you can get
the service was perfect and the food was good
the only thing i would have liked was more ice in my water because the food was so spicy
this relatively new restaurant is an upscale offshoot of india_masala located in the riviera food_court
it is decent size and nicely appointed
we shared vegetarian and tandori thalis that included a variety of vegetarian entrees and sides
pappadum with chutneys
tandori_chicken
basmati_rice
naan
chicken_tika
and rice_pudding
everything tasted pretty good
but i thought prices were high in relation to the quantity of food served
on our next visit i will opt for either the luncheon buffet or order regular entrees
a rating of
would be more appropriate
nice ambiance and the wait_staff was friendly
i think there are much better indian restos in town
my main qualm was that the food took a long time to come out and we were one of only two parties there
there were also no togo pick ups at the time
pm
so it was a little frustrating
the other thing i didn't like was the portions were smaller than expected
the food was a little blander than the way i like indian food
but maybe you can request a higher spice_level
as said before
nothing special
this place has excellent food
this is one of the top meals we had while visiting_vegas
i ordered the chicken_tikka with a side of lemon_rice and garlic_naan
i can't emphasize how good this was and we will be back for more
this is by_far_the_best_indian food i have tasted
the lemon_rice was delicious
highly_recommend it
the chicken_tikka was juicy and favorable
we have tried indian food at lot of tourist places
but the indo_chinese food and the appetizers were very tasty
the staff was also very accommodating
will visit again when in vegas
yum
yum
this place appeared out of no where
i think there was a mongolian grill type place and i ate at only once in this location
i was not holding out too much hope since this restaurant is two blocks away from my previously favorite indian food establishment
let_me_tell_you why this place rocks
first
the waiter was friendly and able to make recommendations
then we got the food
whoo
i had the tikki_masala with chicken and my friend had the butter_chicken
i had buttered naan and she had the capati
the spices in the tikki_masala were incredible
the portion of the naan was more than i could have hoped for
my friend really enjoyed her food
we both had enough left_overs to take home and have lunch_the_next_day
why is this place better than the joint down the street
better quality taste and our bill was smaller
tried this place for the first time tonight
loved the food and the service was great
can't_wait_to_come_back and try different stuff
review for the lunch buffet only
my indian buffet resume for las_vegas thus far includes saffron_flavors_of_india
summerlin
taj_palace
henderson
and the neighborhood rival a few blocks down
mint
in general
what i look for in indian_buffets is value
variety
and flavor
thus far
i think taj_palace wins in flavor
mint has variety but seems to always underwhelm me in the flavor category
and saffron is severely lacking in variety
no tandoori_chicken
i literally observed an angry customer lecture the waiter on the lack of tandoori_chicken and then proceeded to order some on top of his buffet
not quite ready to proclaim india_masala as best one in town since i still need to cross off mt
everest and namaste off the list
but for value
see below
and variety
they deserve some props
in general
i have been surprised by the high prices for indian_buffets in vegas compared to some other places i've lived
almost always in the double digit dollar range
and i'm at a point in my life where i no longer have the capability to polish off plates dessert to get my money's worth so just like an aging greg maddux who has to add some off speed pitches to compensate for his slower fastball or michael jordan adding a fadeaway to his shot selection during the second half of his career
i too had to change up my game
and this buffet is ideally suited for my plan of attack
back in college
when my roommate and i were short on cash
we would routinely compete to see who could pack the most food in the local indian restaurant
take out buffet
styrofoam tray
over several trips
we came up with the ideal arrangement which consisted of wet items on the bottom
layer of rice to soak up some flavors but with dry side above
as much tandoori_chicken as we could fit
then cushioning everything with naan and other odds and ends
this ended_up easily being the equivalent of meals while preserving the integrity of of each item
so when i showed_up one day from my office with a short lunch break
i went with the buffet to go option and was ecstatic when they presented me not only with the usual styrofoam tray
but packed my naan separately in tinfoil and gave me two additional styrofoam bowls
huzzah
my college roommate would be nodding in approval as i packed my tray full bursting at the seams but now had two additional bowls which i could pack with soup
dessert
salad
or additional rice or any liquid item suitable for dipping my crispy warm naan
all in all i foraged enough food to feed a small indian village
in terms of variety
this is a double edged sword since like other reviewers have mentioned
this can be hit_or_miss both in terms of quality
some dishes soared whereas others fell flat
and the expectation of seeing your favorite dishes being present on any given day is highly variable since they do a good job
perhaps too good
of rotating dishes in and out
i've been here times
and i've seen at least distinct dishes not present from before including sauteed okra
fish_curry
egg curry
goat_curry
and the occasional indo_chinese food item
definitely get this when it is available
the setup of the restaurant inside is very clean
spacious
and welcoming and for someone that appreciates variety
i like the fact that they take chances and have something for everyone
but not everything is for everyone
it's an educational foodie experience to see the a wide spectrum of rice dishes
unique desserts
and breads that you won't know if you will like unless it's put forth in front of you
one glaring omission from the buffet is the samosas since i have yet to see an appearance and while taste of specific items may not be superior to other buffets across town
it definitely edges out mint head to head for the lunch buffet on the east_side since they are not afraid to throw in some spice and i'd much rather the items err on being bold than being bland
stars with an extra half star bump due to the hidden value in getting their buffet to go
this review is for the buffet only
since i was so pleased with my food when i visited last time
i thought about trying the buffet
they had types of chicken
tikka masala
tandoori and something called chicken veduppu
spelling
i had a small piece of the veddupu chicken and it was really good and seemed to have good flavor
the tikka masala was ok
i was hoping for atleast a couple of options of the indo_chinese dishes
but all they had was a schezwan veggie dish
which was super super spicy and i could just have a few bites
they also had dosas which though fresh were not crisp
and were wrongly labeled as utthapam
about the labels i would suggest that they take care to label food properly
as they had labeled the potato mix that goes with dosas as aloo gobhi
cauliflower potato
the mix itself was ok and had very large pieces of potato and was obviously not the original stuff served with dosas
so the things i was looking_forward to south_indian and indo_chinese were seriously lacking in taste
for veggies
they had a few options okra
black dal
some veg curry
i tried a bit of the okra and dal and they were just ok
desert was pretty blah too
pink colored fruit custard and halwa
they need to really consider labeling and arranging the food in a logical order
as i remember standing in the middle of the buffet looking for rice
as it was placed next to the desert
the halwa was labeled 'kesari' which i think is a south_indian version of halwa so i knew it was desert
however
for my non hindi speaking friends
it might have been confusing as it was placed next to the rice and could have passed off as a savory dish
i guess these are initial glitches and i do hope they improve
as i would love to have one indian_restaurant_in_vegas that serves consistently good food
not overly impressed
large selection of entree dishes
no saag_paneer though
everthing was good
just not extraordinary
seems like they go for quantity over quality
i will say the custard with fruit was some of the best ive had
service was friendly_and_attentive
overall decent but mint a mile west on flamingo has much better food
though a smaller selection
a good place for indian food
the decor and service were superb
dinner
our experience was more like
stars
but i'll give the nice attentive staff an extra half star for effort
first off
i'm thinking
what's
jainism
this was the first time i've ever encountered an indian restaurant that had dishes for those who observe jain as a religion
and as a cuisine
or at least identified as jain on a menu
quickly and secretly reading wiki
i find that their cuisine consists of a refusal to eat
bulbs
meaning no garlic
onions
potatoes or such
fascinating read
jainism
but back to the meal
we had a lot of food
cuz we had a groupon
but also cuz we love so much about indian_cuisine
and simply don't go enough
cuminium
a cocktail containing gin
absinthe
cumin and other things
it was actually quite interesting
and enjoyable
vegetable_samosas
not the best we've had
but quite good
andhraspicy masala_dosa
under the
southern_indian
column in the menu
this was quite good
kinda like having the samosa again
except in a crepe
dusted with a spicy powder that
like szechuan pepper
built up spice in the mouth
great dipping_sauces
including one akin to a minestrone soup
highly_recommended
and in fact
i think the
southern
column
or vegetarian selections
is the way to go here
keep reading
flying horse lager
split a tall indian beer
this one we had never before encountered
it was light but worked with the main_courses
shrimp chettinadu
billed as a spice concoction
again
something we'd never before encountered
unfortunately the shrimp were overcooked
but the sauce
very dry for a sauce
was interesting enough
lamb pepper fry
again the protein
this time lamb
was overcooked
tough
but the onions
grilled and raw
not a jain item
and other things made it overall tasty
so overall we thought india_masala was about mid way in this town for its quality of indian_cuisine
we've had worse
we've had better
i want to eventually return for the lunch buffet
i have found that some places which aren't quite successful at dinner do quite well with their buffet
but as for dinner
i might go back if friends insist
and only go vegetarian
or maybe be jain
for an evening
addendum
oops
forgot to mention
i had brought a bottle of gewurztraminer to have with dinner
corkage was quoted as twenty five dollars
and they're not even on the strip
so don't bother bringing your own
just order a cocktail and split a beer
as we did
what a great find in vegas
discovered_this_place through restaurant
com
good food
clean and spacious facility
reasonably_priced
very short ride from the strip
pleasing decor
i enjoyed my meal thoroughly
i live in in la and visit vegas at least times a year
i am glad i found a good india restaurant there
don't hesitate to try
i was excited_to_try this restaurant yesterday because it's one of the few indian_restaurants that serves south_indian food
i checked the times on the website and facebook for dinner service and arrived during what i thought was dinner service
i was told the restaurant was not seating customers because of a private party
only takeout was available
anyone familiar with south_indian food
ie dosas
knows it doesn't lend itself to takeout so i left disappointed and doubt i will go back
so my review is for poor service
why not post on facebook that there is no dinner service
not the food
i would advise anyone to call before making the trip to make sure you will be served
the low rating is due mostly to the poor customer_service received at this restaurant
i think there are better indian_restaurants in vegas and i would not come back here again
waited forever sitting at the table before getting our order taken
had to ask for water multiple_times and once my bf gave the evil eye to the manager did we finally get some help
the place wasn't that busy either
maybe tables
i am not sure if it was because we were foreigners in the restaurant but our waiter ignored us a lot and then later seemed scared to approach our table since we were pretty upset
when asking about menu_items
it seemed like alot of them were not available that night which sucked
the butter_chicken we ordered had pieces of bone in it and had to pay extra for rice on the side
i mean putting aside the customer_service
the food was ok but i would not repeat since it was very slow service
when not busy
and the whole experience seemed pretty miserable
this review is for the lunch buffet
this is a nice looking restaurant
big buffet there were lots of choices
and definitely more vegetarian friendly options than nearby mint
i think they are a little better than mint in terms of sheer flavor and spice_level while still not where i'd like it to be
it's a little more flavorful than typical indian buffet food
the malai_kofta was good and so was the aloo_gobi the latter had a nice fresh gingery flavor
naan was served piping_hot but our second basket didn't make it to our table until we were almost done eating
the service was a bit tricky in general several different people waited on us
and there was no coordination between them
and they could be a little slow
at one point we waited like minutes for someone to get us drink refills
and then right after we asked one guy to get them
another was asking if we wanted refills
it was confusing and inefficient
it's somewhere between and stars as far as vegas indian_buffets but i am erring on the side of less stars because of one glaring buffet omission
paneer
where was the paneer
india_masala is
okay
i had heard about their location in riviera but there's no way i'm braving the strip
its tourists and its prices just for indian food
so when my wife and i saw india_masala had finally opened a second location while we were on our way to our preferred indian buffet
mint
we decided we had to try it
in short
we should've just stuck with mint
there's nothing objectively bad about india_masala
you could even make the argument that the food is a bit more flavorful than the seemingly afraid of spice mint
but whether it's the decor
the service or the selection
something about this place just didn't click with me
another disappointing contestant in a city that is
sadly
completely bereft of indian_restaurants
and where oh where is the gulab_jamun
we ordered naans
chicken curry and chicken_biryani to pick_up in indian masala when we were in vegas on vacation
we didn't know that indian masala has branches one on strip and one here
we went to the one on strip and then came here
coz they said they're different
what a waste of time
anyways
it's our mistake to get confused
coming to the food
what a horrible food
sooo disappointing
the naans are burnt to the core
i somehow managed to get one small piece that wasn't burnt and it is uncooked
how can somebody manage to burn so much yet uncook
chicken was soooooo raw and had bones
a good vet could still have saved the hen
this review is for dinner
quick review
food was good but the service was very very bad
details
i have been to this place several times since its opening
service has been okay so far
but tonight it was disastrous
it took more than minutes to take the order
once order was made
food arrived in reasonable time
but after this no one cared to check our table for more than minutes
the restaurant was not even busy
we finished our food and were kept waiting
even the water was not refilled
i thought of ordering another dish and a dessert
but the lack of service made me decide against it
came in for dinner because a friend_of_mine told me about this place and i have to say i wasn't just served a meal like all the other restaurants do here in town i feel like i was given a great experience for the short while i was there
the staff was extremely knowledgeable about the food there which was great because i am not too familiar with it and after my food order was taken the bartender
whom was extremely beautiful and charming
came and personally took my drink order even though the place was pretty busy
she made me their signature india_masala cocktail and it was hands_down the best cocktail i've ever had in my life hats off to the bartender
the food came out in a reasonable time and the food was amazing
best food i've had in years i gave my compliments to the chef
the prices were very reasonable and as i was leaving they acknowledged i was leaving
gave mea big smile
and said to come back again and it was a pleasure to have me
they hit all the notes to what wonderful customer_service is and i am definetely going back there again soon
ok
i already tried the one they have on riveira casino
frist impression of that place wasn't that great
so i had spoiled potatoes in my_favorite_dish
dosa
after that i never went there
then i heard this place
gave the frist try with our family
in the evening time wan't that busy and we had great welcome from the front desk and the waiter guy was kind enough to bring three high chairs for our baby to make the broken one replaced
he was no smile and pleasent
bar tender dude was ecceptional and he knows what he doing
he made great magarita and his generous service was make any one happy
i tried the chicken_tika dosa twise
really
it was that good
only the down fall was the shrimp biriani the shrims were bad taste like they were uncooked
the waiter dude
santiago fernandez
is a collest indian waiter i ever seen
i think this dude knows what he talking_about when he is explaining the food
even he gave me wierdest messurment of the legnth of the dosa that chef made in the kitchen
it was unacceptable but belivable fact
lols to my self
we all happy about the service and the prices but they finally took the shrim beriani put of our bill by manager raj
keep his mustache perfectly fine
something dollarasss
went down to kindof
bless me groupon
we will go back thats for sure and we will send more people
more sri lankans of course
i have eaten at this place many times and it has become my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in las_vegas
indian food can get expensive but this is reasonable
the superb food way out weights the cost
i try different dishes each time i go and have yet to be disappointed
if you are not sure what to order or if you will like it
they have a lunch buffet that has a pretty good choice for you to sample and again very reasonable
meat dishes are my favorite but they have a good portion of vegetarian_dishes on the buffet too
dal_makhani is my favorite vegetarian dish
but all are good
they always have different chutney's to choose from with salad and fresh fruit
the nan_bread is always fresh and the service is friendly
this is a rather new restaurant and as the word gets out it will get hard to get a table on friday or saturday_night dinner without a wait
i would go now and be a trend setter by telling you friends
they will love you for it
every time i attend a conference in las_vegas
i end up at india_masala bar grill for a truly wonderful dining_experience
rajesh
the owner's son always ensures you a truly unique and unforgettable culinary feast
we love spicy and the chef's ability to pay attention to your level of spicy is spot on
the menu is truly reasonably_priced
the wine_list is exceptional and a wide_variety of dishes from the north and south of india makes india_masala a lights out choice
you_won't_be_disappointed in the fragrant curries or special veggie dishes
yes
a truly wonderful dining_experience
just had their buffet that had wonderful tikki_masala
a wide range of indian dishes and various types of rice
was certainly worth it
it was a wonderful experience
we ordered a goat dish with an onion and ginger gravy
the pistachio kulfi was amazing
homemade and creamy
demetri was a fabulous server
very attentive and caring
he even took the time to go through the buffet line and explain every dish and made helpful suggestions
the goat dish was one of them
the naan_bread is fresh and hot
very delicious
we are foodies and definitely will be back
and will bring friends
thank you for the hospitality
i drive by this place all the time and finally stopped in
must thank yelp for the deal
my roommate and i were hungry and the fridge was empty
search for a deal and boom
right next to home
we came in around dinner time and it was fairly packed
after
i am glad we came in when we did
the dinner rush came in mins after we did
service
outstanding
waiters very tentative to us
but i felt that too many different servers approached us and made it difficult to keep track
our waiter that took our order gave me some good recommendations since i have not had india food before
our first app was the chicken
different spices
i thought dang
i'm gonna need lots of water
turns_out
very flavorful
similar to carne asada since it was served with diced onions and cilantro
our main was the masala_dosa dn the tandorri dinner
i am first glad i didn't go with the foot long dosa
would have been way too much
i loved the dosa
very spicy the one i got
but also fresh
tandoori was very nice
plenty of different meats
i do feel that the chicken was dry as well as the sausage
over cooked
this probably happen since the kitchen was backed up
my roommate loved the naan
so great
that he ordered another basket
we got our free mango for checking via yelp
very tasty drink
from the name
i first thought it was a jelly
everything was great
but kitchen was overwhelmed by the rush
waiters did apologized many times
and we listened into the other tables complaints and all
i felt that they handled the neighboring table well since they were upset by a mistaken order
others were upset by the wait
overall
i'll come back
do want to try the lunch buffet
this place had some great reviews so i figured i would give the buffet a try
i was really not impressed
first impressions were good in the door
it is nicely_decorated and clean
we got there about minutes after the buffet had opened but the food looked like it had already been sitting out a while with skins on the tops
we enjoyed the chicken_tikka_masala
rice and the naan_bread
but everything else was pretty disappointing
i was also surprised they had no desserts besides fruit
most indian_buffets i go to at least have rice_pudding
we ordered mango_lassis as well because they didnt have cold chais
which didnt really taste like mango
they were like white
sour
runny greek yogurt drinks
honestly
i will not go back
there are much better places_in_town
perhaps sit_down is a better experience
i have been to indian_restaurants throughout the u
s and this place is
by far
the best
i'm serious
amazing
no idea how this place got any good reviews
we went for the lunch buffet and it was awful
we arrived right when the place opened and the food was not fresh
already had a skin on it
the buffet was laid_out horribly
the rice is in the back and not the front before the entrees
there were no deserts besides fruit
wheres the kihr
we tried almost every entree on the menu and the only one that was decent was the chicken_tikka_masala
the rest was either bland or sour
the goat_curry had bones in it
disgusting
also
avoid the lassi at all costs
it was sour and i could barely get through a few sips
this either means the yogurt used had gone sour or they do not know how to make a lassi
either way it sucked
as you probably have already guessed
i will_not_be_returning
even if they paid me
do yourself a favor and drive two blocks down flamingo and go to mint instead
get a strawberry or mango_lassi
it will show you how a lassi is supposed to taste
was good for the price
quiet
poor service
i would go all five_stars but yes
as i am not very picky knowing you can't get perfect with buffet style
the food could be stirred up a little
no big_deal folks
i thought it was very clean and i enjoyed the atmosphere of the music and how helpful everyone was
i am an italian who knows good tasting food
this stuff was delicious
if people go here expecting typical buffets with a bunch of treats and meats you are crazy and don't belong writing shitty reviews
i have seen this place a few times as it is next_door to my fav pawn shop that my friend works at
i went in and enjoyed the lunch buffet had great service and will def go back again
didn't know the owners son works the front but i would like to pass along the thanks for the hospitality and service
keep up the good work
super friendly people and someone is cooking up some delicious food in that kitchen
came for dinner on a tuesday
not to crowded
had the vegetable_korma which was off the hook
the wife and i went for dinner as a spur of the moment thing
upon walking in
we were impressed with the ambiance
it was open and airy
we were warmly greeted and seated
at the table we were our server presented us with a basket of delightfully light and crisp chips accompanied_by plum and mint_chutney dips
our server was dmitri
he was great
he was speedy without being pushy
he knew the menu and was willing to accommodate special requests
we ordered the tilapia appetizer
the portion could have been an entree for two
the fish was appropriately flaky without being dry
it was spicy without assaulting the taste_buds
i had to hold back so that i would have room for the main_course
these did_not_disappoint
i had the lamb_curry at spice_level
and my wife had the chicken masala at spice_level
the chicken had to be special ordered
the chicken normally used has the red pink coloring to it
this tends to upset my wife's stomach
dmitri was able to convey this to the chef and the chef nailed it
most_importantly
we did not have to wait any longer for this modified meal
and by the way
the chicken was amazing
juicy
flavorful
and sliced just right
the lamb was the same
i sampled both over a nicely prepared bed of basmati_rice
i only regret not saving room for dessert
next time
another impressive thing was the menu selection
oftentimes indian_restaurants only serve regional dishes
this menu offers a full culinary tour of india
i am not one for buffets
but i might try theirs just to take the full tour
the pricing was reasonable
had we not ordered the tilapia and mango_lassi
which was extraordinary
our meal with tip would have been about
that is a great dinner price just about anywhere
but is an exceptional value in vegas
this place hit the grand slam for me
ambiance
service
food
and price
my boss and i just happened to drive upon this place after realizing we were too early for lunch at los
i am very open to any type of food and not afraid to try_new_things
that being said i am not at all familiar with the assortment of dishes that i tried or the names nor am i an_expert_on_indian food
but i can appreciate the fact that the lunch buffet was very descriptive of the what each item was
the waiter was attentive and it's very cute inside
one of my favorite dishes was the fruit salad in a sweet yogurt
i can say that for
lunch buffet with a lot of choices i will be back
i've gone here twice so far and both times i've had exceptional service
there's a deal from yelp you can use to get or off your meal
i love their masala chai
naan
their chicken_tikka_masala and chicken_korma
they also have a great lunch selection as well
definitely coming_back to this place
the last indian buffet i went to there was so much oil over the aluminium containers
f
e
m
a
was called to take care of the spill
the left over saag
spinach
from previous nights had overcooked to the point
it had turned brown and looked like an alien
the owners of india_masala
should be proud to be calling themselves indian
since i have never been to an indian restaurant
which is impeccably clean and classy
the buffet is the main attraction and not a corner side show as in other indian_restaurants
last time i was there
i ate so much i had to find a tree to wind around to digest the incredible food that i had at the buffet
not to mention it is not easy_to_find a tree in the desert
they also have a nice cozy bar and i have a red_wine
preferably chilled since the the wine sommeliers
who go to school of higher learning with student loans jauntily come back to tell the bartenders to serve red_wine at
room temperature
room temperature in las_vegas
happens to be degrees fahrenheit
the bartenders who are taught not to argue with experts follow the dictum to the tee
the red_wine has to be chilled to taste good and even a cheap wine will taste good chilled and most mere mortals drink cheap wine
not to digress
i have red_wine before and during dinner which gives you a tremendous appetite
unlike beer
that makes you full and not to mention gives you buddha like belly
the buffet is not only sight for sore eyes with over forty
north and south_indian items
but it a feast for the palate
to say the least
the buffet is freshly cooked unlike chinese restaurants where they serve left over from the previous week
the secret to good indian food is authentic cooks
i found out from the waiters that they have four north and south_indian cooks
most of the indian_restaurants have no cooks
but someone on a tourist visa paying off their debts
the service is superb and the ambiance is embellishment to the feast
there is no way anyone can get this kind of food for the price they are charging and this can happen only in las_vegas the buffet capitol of the world
india_masala is the indian buffet capitol of las_vegas
i would say this is the healthiest buffet food in las_vegas or anywhere
it is time for my weekly visit to the capitol
we stopped for dinner last_night as it had been awhile since we had indian food
since we got there right at pm which is their opening time
the place was empty and we_were_seated_immediately
water was brought quickly and we also ordered regular iced_tea
the server came back and said they were out of regular iced_tea and they only had the sweetened raspberry tea
we got that instead
for an appetizer
we ordered the medhu wada
two deep_fried doughnuts made from ground lentils
rice
and black pepper
with it was served three chutneys or sauces that added some to the dryness of the wada
the sauces were a tomato based one
a soup
and a coconut based one
the wadas were very flavorful and after chewing
you got the flavor of the black pepper
when our server went to clear the dishes
she asked if we wanted to keep any of the chutneys
i kept the soup and ate it
it was great
for dinner
my wife ordered the garlic chicken and i ordered madras curry chicken
spice_level on a to basis
we also ordered some garlic_naan
dinner came with basmati_rice
we both liked our meals
and we had garlic chicken to bring home for another meal for one of us
the garlic_naan was good
for dessert
we shared a dish of kheer
a couple of things keep me from ranking the place higher
on one of the hottest days this summer
the restaurant was very warm
i don't like freezing in a place either and i always take a denim long sleeve shirt with me
i sure didn't need it as i was perspiring and it wasn't from the curry
speaking of that
is not high enough for a good spice_level
their was rather tame and the curry seemed to be lacking some of the rich flavor it should have
perhaps i'm spoiled by thai curry
i think i need to stay_away_from indian curry
the kheer had no pistachio chunks on it which somewhat makes the dish interesting
i saw the photo that westie w
posted and i thought that it was really enticing
the no regular iced_tea threw me
i was going to ask them if i could have some hot water and a tea bag and a glass of ice
i could have made my own
out of iced_tea is so lame
we bought a yelp_deal which is in essence a off deal
this place is ok
but i won't be returning
there are good good
fully supplied indian_restaurants_in_town
some of the best indian food i've had in a long time
although very spicy
i usually have the buffet but tonight i ordered off of the menu
i specifically wanted the chicken chili dish that i tried at one
only one unfortunately
of the buffets
never saw it again at the buffet so had to order it for dinner
it's listed under appetizers on the menu
that made me think it wasn't a dinner sized portion
the waitress asked what spice_level
only had that asked at thai restaurants
we ordered medium
also ordered saag_paneer at medium_spice
i should have asked for everything to be served together because the chicken came out first
it was fresh and hot
and also blazingly spicy
damn
it was so flavorful and quite tasty with an insane depth of flavor
but so hot
couldn't stop_eating it
the saag was just as hot but oh so fresh
chunks of tomato with strands of chive on top
could have used a little more salt i think
but a little too hot
tongue went numb
which i don't mind if the food is outstanding
also had rice and garlic_naan with meal
i would have given stars
but the spice_level of the meal caused intestinal distress for a few days
which i usually experience eating indian food
the spice_level of the food at the buffet is far less than when you order_off_the_menu
dining here reminded_me_of the first time i went to shalimar
which i thought was some hot indian food
i love indian food
but for some reason gives me intestinal distress
india_masala is another great indian restaurant in my 'hood
mint
ghandi
india_palace
which i am truly grateful for
will go again and lower the spice_levels
extremely tasty food
careful with the spice_levels
must be unedible
i came on a friday during lunch and had ate their buffet for
classy
high ceiling
fancy wine glass for water
nice silverware
great chicken curry
not dry
solid variety
great taste
no old film over curries
hint of spice
to go buffet same price as lunch
they had some chopped fruit
but didn't look too appetizing
plates
naan
and vermicelli pudding was enough to put me in a food coma
zzzz
i'd chose mint if you come solo and want to yolo
but if you're
this is the place since you can use the for value and get the mango dessert from check in
clean and classy restaurant
welcoming staff and nice service
did not really like the buffet
may be they are showing less love in preparing lunch buffet items
economical food for the ambiance and good for groups
its not the best biriyani you will get in vegas
still i will recommend shalimar for best biriyani
chicken_tikka_masala with nan is good
dosa is ok
its not the best indian food out there but can go once
first timer might like it
this has been a frequent spot but recently the food quality has gone bad
these_guys used to have a good dosa around
few of us came by dinner and were served dosas which were very sour
old batter i think probably a few days old
was not a good experience at all
we said this and it didn't look like the chef cared much
atmosphere was nice
very clean
service was atrocious
seated quickly
but waited forever just to order
five tables with patrons
four wait_staff just walking from one place to another doing nothing
as dishes would empty
we placed them aside in an organized manner
yet none of the wait_staff bothered to clear them
we actually had a new dish brougt to our table and they simply moved aside the empty used dishes and left them on our crowded table
ordered the tandoori_chicken and chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori was not as flavorful as i've had at other restaurants
tikka was good
but it barely fed two people
i expected more for the price in terms of quality of food and service
a real disappointment
will not be a repeat diner
nice spot to grab cheap indian
with a great variety of choices of northern and southern cuisine
portion_sizes are generous and full of flavor
lots of coupons for checking in
onion cilantro naan was delicious and filling
madras chicken curry was full of flavor and the perfect amount of spicy
nice local spot
a good escape from the strip with friendly service
had an amazing experience
i ordered the chicken_vindaloo and my gf had the korma
both were perfectly spiced and had amazing flavors
the naan was the best i've ever had
service was good and prompt even though our waiter had the personality of a neatly folded napkin
i would highly_recommend this place and get the groupon deal
well worth it
staff very nice
food was good
very good food and great service
they made special non garlic non onion food for my mom
best indian food
we had lunch buffet delicious
chicken
bhuna gosht very good and perfectly spiced
service was very nice impressed ambiance
try the best indian restaurant in town
i m big_fan of indian food and this is my first visit to india_masala bar and grill
i just want to say wow
best indian_restaurant_in_vegas
tonight we went for dinner
we had sach a wonderful experience
food was great
lamb madras curry and garlic_nan
yum_yum
our server was pawan
he is professional and the best
suggest us some good wine and food
thanks india_masala
the lunch buffet was good
not great but better than the other restaurants around
hands_down the best_indian_food_in_town
additionally some of the best i've ever had
they are super_nice here and the portions are so much better than most places
i got the lamb_curry my girl got the lentil crepe
both were absolutely incredible
definitely our top place to go now
this is my first yelp review and this review
is for vegetarian_dishes only
awesome
awesome
awesome
this place came up in yelp search
when we were looking for indain restaurant for dinner
on one of our vegas trips
the food here will not disappoint you
and worth it's value
we had veggie_korma and sambar rice
both were very
delicious
you have an option of setting the spice_level to
for every dish and you get what you ask for
service was very friendly and we got complimentary
mango_lassi since their kitchen was little behind and we were waiting for our food
to be served
overall very positive experience and would love to go back
when we are back in vegas
i brought my brother here on a recent visit to vegas
he has had a lot of indian food in chicago
he said this was the best indian food he ever had
we had a great dinner starting with samosas that were delicious
great flavor and seasoning
we also had chicken_korma and tikka
both fabulous
the tikka is my favorite
we enjoyed a very tasty indian beer
hayward's
and finished with home made ice_cream
mango and pistachio
both real nice
i went back to have the lunch buffet later in the week and found many new dishes that i really enjoyed
the curry chicken was just divine
the restaurant is clean and nicely_decorated with very friendly servers and management
the garlic_naan is awesome
the levels of flavor in the dishes i tried were so complex and fun to eat
it was a pleasure to eat at india_masala
i can't wait to visit again
this place is amazing
i went for the lunch buffet and the scents draw you in from the moment you walk through the door
there were so many delicious options to choose from that i didn't even know where to begin
the naan is the best i've ever had and i've lived in india
there is something about the way the flavors of the food blend together so perfectly
the chef has created a truly magical experience for you
the staff is also very friendly_and_attentive
i really just can't say enough about how fantastic this restaurant is
i go back anytime i'm in the area
this place is great
i'm always comparing indian_restaurants
i always find something wrong but honestly speaking i could not find a single thing wrong with this place
the staff was great and caring
i overheard them trying to find a taxi for some tourist
the food was really good
i had paneer butter masala and unlike other paneer dishes this was not oily at all and the naan was soft
which i love
i hate crunchy and chewy naan
i took butter_chicken and gobi_manchurian
which is a south_indian dish
home for my boyfriend and he loved it
i am a vegetarian so according to my boyfriend the meat dish was really good
i will_be_coming_back for sure
especially when i'm feeling homesick
this place had one of the best indian food i have had
the chicken_tikka_masala was amazing
a good variety for their_lunch_buffet
and usually u get a good discount coupon on yelp that helps
yelp_deal is a big sham
i did a togo of food on a tuesday night and the guy at the counter says the manager wont accept it
he agrees after i read him the conditions and fine print from yelp
an item in my order was also missing
food is so so
there are far better places for indian food around
free_mango_lassi with checkin
that being said
i had the lunch buffet
the highlights for me were the chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori_chicken
garlic_nan
and keer
the potato pancake was interesting as well
similar to what i've had in korean cuisine
but this one has a bit of sourness to it
there are different_types_of chutney and also salad
some of the vegetarian_dishes were tasty as well
but i'm disappointed there was no paneer
overall it is good
service is excellent as the staff was very friendly_and_helpful
i think we had yelp checkins and they were so happy to give us our free_mango_lassi
so much so they even gave_us an extra one
there is also pineapple n cantaloupe for those who like to end their meal with fresh fruit
the meat dishes like lamb kebab chicken we're not that great
paneer_tikka_masala
plenty of gravy but only cubes paneer
chana_masala was ok
naan was fresh soft
disclaimer
i haven't tried the food here yet
not sure i will bother
the star_review is for the crap service
if i ever return to eat
i will update accordingly
i placed an online order for pick_up through eat
was quoted minutes
i get there a few minutes_later than that and was told that the order was not made due to the chef being busy
host says the chef can make it now
but it will be another minutes
i'm on a lunch break from work
already blew through most of it driving there
no thanks
canceled
really irritated that no one thought to let me know the order would be delayed
wasted enough of my time that i couldn't go elsewhere
i understand shit happens
but let me know so i can plan around it
not cool
india_masala is an indian restaurant near unlv's campus on flamingo
the parking_lot does get filled because a combination of india_masala
the various business around
and the small parking_lot
i'm impressed with the interior
it is very nice and a huge improvement from what was there
only a few years_ago
that being said it is very nice inside but how does the rest stack up
well i came here with my usual large_group of co_workers and they were more than accomendating
we all did the lunch buffet which was only
the same price as mt
everest
in comparison buffet wise
i do perfer mt
everest a lot more because they had more selection
flavor
and better quality in the non salad and non dessert items but india_masala is an ok substitute
so they don't have a large selection on their buffet
their rice dish wasn't mixed well
large patches of non mixed rice was found throughout
the curry dishes were very running
if they weren't meant to be running
but their desserts
the free_mango_lassi after check in and yogurt tapioca pudding looking things with fruits were all very delicious
their meat dishes and regular garlic naans were about the same
customer_service was excellent
when a few of us decided to use our free lassi check in offers and they gave more than enough it became awesome
there are better indian_restaurants in the area
the food in the buffet were alright but not good enough for me to be a fan of
maybe i'll come back for dinner or not do the buffet
they do have a happy_hour from pm pm for with a drink list and off selected appetizers
came with my vegan dining partner
we came at lunch and they had only the buffet but we told them we were vegan so they let us order_off_the_menu
although we announced we were vegan
i ordered a chai_tea
and they brought me a chai with creme
so it was quickly exchanged for a plain black tea
the spice was a tiny heavy for a of
so use caution there
very yummy
easy menu and good value
very close to unlv
worth a try
my friend recommended this place
so we ended_up checking it out mid week for some lunch buffet action
place was fairly busy
wait_staff were friendly and we_were_seated_immediately
the food
this is where they lose stars
while the curries are ok and all
the choices are very limited
and rather uninspiring
the meat items were generic
altho the butter_chicken was quite delish compared to the rest
but i've had better
no beef lamb goat seaffood options
a bit vanilla if you ask me
the garlic_naan though was amazing
some of the best naan i've had in recent years
def recommend getting those
customer_service was superb
only wish the curry choices and quality were a bit better
excellent food
loved the tava fish and chicken karahi
i love_this_place because it's relatively cheap
especially with the groupon
and i love buffets
lunch buffet
plus half off w groupon
i just wish there were a little more vegan variety
all of the vegan food kind of just compliments the naan_bread instead of being awesome by itself
but to be fair i think that's how most indian dishes are supposed_to_be
still really delicious
however
i was never fond of their lunch desserts
they're either kind of weird or boring or both
also
i'm not sure if this was an isolated incident
but the last time i went
the saag
spinach mustard greens curry
was way
way too salty
i actually love salty food and most green things
but that had to be a mistake
hopefully it was just a fluke
despite my complaints
i strongly recommend_this_place for vegans and meat_eaters alike
this place is always tasty
and i leave completely stuffed every time
india_masala on e flamingo rd went here with friends for dinner
excellent customer_service
great indian food
must eat
tamarind rice and bisi bele bath form rice dishes
gobi_manchurian is a must try
be careful when u order the quantity they serve is more
we went back to hotel room with lots of togo boxes and the bill was in
three digit figure
no real complaints
i have been to india_masala on s las_vegas blvd too but that one is definitely not good to try
very good
i was looking for something off of the strip and find myself very pleased
it was pretty quiet at
pm
the staff was extremely polite and attentive and the food was great
i had shrimp tikka masala along with the variety of nan
i'm happy i listened to the waitress when she told me was
i'm on fire hot
was spicy but not too over the top for me
if you like garlic_nan you'll be happy if you order it here
as soon as we reached vegas we were in search of some comfort
authentic food
while we were browsing this on yelp we stumbled upon india_masala bar and grill
as weird as it may seem they had one of the excellent rasam
a soup
i've ever tasted
dinner was as well a buffet spread with neat array of items ranging_from south_indian to north_indian
surprisingly the sambhar
rasam
pakoras were mind blowing and mango_lassi was nothing short of stupendous
garlic_naan was so soft and flavourful
the front desk staff was very cheerful and attentive
the buffet price was pretty kind on the wallet too
i believe if you take some buffet food to go its a couple of dollars cheaper
but i've no_idea_what you may be able to fit in a box in their wide_selection_of delicacies
so this review isn't necessarily about the food
the food is fine
good enough comfort_food with an adequate selection
this is more about the service
i used to frequent this place at lunchtime because it's decently priced
on weekdays
on weekends
on top of that
i'm a student so i sometimes get two for one discount coupons which is nice because i definitely live on a student budget
let me just say that this pricing is very loose
it didn't take me long to realize that the price is rarely
it's almost always
for one reason or another
for example
the restaurant is very busy
it's a
holiday
of some sort
or my personal favorite
the manager told me to raise the price today
hahaha goodness
ok then
we actually made a game of guessing what ridiculous reason we were going to be given for higher prices
because of course pm on a tuesday merits an increase in prices
right
i had a few coupons for buy one get one free
any day of the week
between the hours of and
well of course that's too simple
it wasn't until after we finished_eating that the
server
hostess
someone who appeared to work there
pointed to a tiny yellow sign stuck to the counter that said
no coupons on weekends
and she then proceeded to giggle and say sorry and mutter something about
well managers said so
i'd had it
i was done
it's just a joke of a restaurant
and having nonexistent service from start to finish
watching employees hang out on their phones and read the newspaper at the bar
no thank you
i work in a restaurant
and let_me_tell_you
i wish my job was that easy
thankfully
not all is lost
delhi opened right down the street
their food is always fresh and flavorful and the staff is fantastic
they remembered us after our second visit and are always so excited_to_see us and welcome us
on top of that
their_lunch_buffet is
every day
no exceptions
heck
i'd gladly give them
and i really could care less about coupons
i want to see them do well
such a better choice than india_masala
the saag was ok
but lacking the strong layering of flavor that i expect in this dish
also
the chunks of garlic were all different sizes
some were about inches
the chopping is so sporadic
and obviously rushed
the chicken_tikka_masala was super greasy
waaaay too much ghee
or maybe even oil
the chicken in the tikka masala was grainy and powdery
and there was so little of it
odd
we ordered from eat
where it said that they're delivery fee was free
then when we checked out
our receipt said it was a charge
they said that india_masala charges for delivering
far away
we are literally blocks from them
and that is considered far
what's close
if you live in the same strip_mall as the restaurant
our order took an_hour and minutes to arrive
we will not be ordering from them again
new disclaimer
i get extremely cranky when my blood sugar drops
so
i did go back
to the lunch buffet
based_on the buffet alone
i think i would like to go for dinner at some point
i thought the food was exceptionally good
not just
for a buffet
but in general
i did the lunch buffet for takeout
they are generous with the containers
and separately packaged naan
so i was able to try pretty much some of everything
and lots of some things
the selection is small
but the bases were fairly covered
i knew going in that i wouldn't find samosas
but i still missed them
there also wasn't any pakora
and a few other standard items i was surprised not to see
still
what they do have is solid
the tandoori_chicken was basic
but well prepared and moist
the chicken_tikka_masala was exceptionally good
as was the fish_curry they had
to the best of my knowledge
and please
feel free to message me if i'm wrong
india_masala is the only spot offering a takeout option for their buffet
as you might know from my earlier review
my time is extremely limited on weekday afternoons
it's good to know that i could pop in
fill a few containers
pay
and be on my way in a few minutes with enough delicious food for both lunch and dinner
i love the food at this restaurant
we have normally been to the other branch of it which is in riviera but we thought of checking this one out
i'm not a buffet person and prefer ordering for ourself separately
we tried the chhole masala which came out beautifully good n great level of spice
which i certainly liked
other stuff like the chicken curry n aaloo tikki chaat and the complimentary lassi which we got from our check in made our dinner even more special
next time we tried andhra masala_dosa and indian and esp dosa was great and to add
the chutney's were probably the tastiest i'vs ever had in vegas
we even got the for deal which added to our pleasure
a must go place for all indian food lovers
never going to this place again
my niece husband myself were seated_right_away
made us the nd set of customer in the restaurant
waiter asked if we wanted anythng to drink and all of us told_him we all just wanted water waiter didn't look like he wanted to that asked us back
just water
waiter leaves came back poured us water
aftr a couple of mins
waiter comes back asked if we were ready to order
my husband was ready to place his order my niece who just had late lunch fr work was not goin to order anythng i wasn't ready to place mine
neithr any of us three on our table really hv been to an indian restaurant
took me slightly longer to place my order than my husband
then told waiter i wasn't ready
after a couple of mins
waiter comes back i asked if the dish i was looking getting can b made not spicy waiter right away said
no
ok
it's an indian restaurant they'r known for their spices so then i asked which vegetable dish did not come
creamed
waiter mentioned about three
i picked mixed_vegetables my husband then places his order too
soon as we placed our choices
waiter leaves our table then aftr bout a min comes back said no mixed_vegetables
omg for an indian restaurant who's menu s almost vegetarian
no mixed_vegetables
i then change my order which comes w nan_bread
waiter asked if bread w butter or plain
i said butter on the side waiter stops writing said that they didn't
do butter on the side looked like my request was too difficult
he said i can just give u plain bread
i said ok just bring me some butter
waiter said he's been there a year hv not heard such
i asked waiter to ask their kitchen he tells me they'r busy
there was only three tables now that occupied out if i'd say least tables
they hv the bread
now it's a matter of having butter or not if their nan_bread came eithr plain or already buttered
he could hv said they didn't hv butter which would b nxt to not since butter s almost in evry pantry fridge
but instead waiter was saying they hv not served plain nan_bread w butter on the side
at the end my simple request of nan_bread butter on the side aftr so long of a conversation w the waiter gets on our table along w other things we ordered we also ordered plain rice which didn't get to our table aftr we wer almost done since our waiter forgot we ordered rice only found out aftr checking hw we wer doin as we wer getting almost done
their chicken is bomb
i absolutely love it there
as a foodie
this is by far one of my favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
also try the briyani
it is infused with amazing flavors
flavorful yet something was bit off
couldn't quite put my finger on it but some things were just too spicy too greasy and too empty in the pan
waited but they wouldn't fill it
they had lots of selections so i really didn't have to try everything
i liked most of the dishes i tried
the waitress was nice but hostess had bit of an attitude
oh well
i don't maybe i was sensitive on this day
decent food but very very expensive
try the south_indian food very good stuff
avoid dosa
i came here for the lunch buffet on a weekday
the food and customer_service were both decent
but i'm giving them one star for the management's ridiculous antics
i had a coupon for a free buffet which i'm guessing they tried to compensate for by tacking on gratuity to a party of five
is that even legal
there were no signs on the menu or by the cash_register to justify this
the host didn't bother to tell me that gratuity was added to my total
and the receipt wasn't itemized
my receipt only listed a
pre tip total
when they had in fact already added gratuity to that price
i had to ask why the total was so high
and that's how i found how that i was already charged gratuity
they're just trying to gyp their customers
no thanks
i was totally disappointed with this restaurant
food tasted horrible and there were not many options
the staff also did not respond well when we told them the food was not hot enough
overall
i wouldn't visit this place again
i tried the lunch buffet and i was not the least disappointed
the food was delicious and the waiters were very attentive
the buffet offers about eight different dishes
which may seem like a small selection
but the quality of the dishes leaves you more than satisfied
i have been to buffets with a greater selection of dishes
but the chicken and vegetables are not as fresh and i end up with a stomach ache
the complimentary naan_bread alone is worth the visit
the restaurant itself
the food
and the price are right
a must go to restaurant
always love a good indian buffet
and they deliver that here
fresh
tasty
could be a little spicier
and i know it's hit_or_miss with other indian_buffets
but samosas would be a nice addition
otherwise it was a good experience
and would certainly go back again
we had a very tasty meal here tonight
the mango_lassi had full mango flavor
yummy
the chapati and sauces were the best i have had
and yes i have eaten indian food before many times although not in india
but in london
we ordered chicken_tikka dosa
goat_curry
basmati_rice
and naan
it was our first time having a dosa
not sure that we have seen this on a menu before
but we are glad that we tried it
if you have never had one and you like crepes
this is a must have
of course
the sauces that went with it were just delightful
bursting with flavor in every bite
the curry was also very flavorful and so was the wonderful naan
we order the rice so the goat_curry had something to sit on
for two of us
we had way too much food but managed to eat most of it
service was very attentive and pleasant
wonderful experience and great food
a restaurant can be judged by it's chutneys
this statement holds very true for india_masala
loved the food
highly_recommend aloo paratha
fish_curry and yellow dal
dosa was fresh and delicious as well
had their buffet during a recent trip_to_vegas and came back extremely dissatisfied
will not go back there again
the selection was small
the food did not taste good
their rasam was over the top spicy
i eat super spicy but this was insane
and was floating in oil
the owner host told me that he had never tasted rasam before and thought that the base of the rasam was oil
lol
they need to get a new chef who really knows how to cook indian food
mini dosa was good
but the only chutney they had was made of tomato and was tasteless
seriously how can anyone ruin tomato chutney
they charge
for their buffet
such a waste of money
you pay just a couple bucks more and you get excellent and super tasty food at mint
i dont know when they opened
but we were driving through and it said now open
having been to swagat many times
still love swagat
this was a welcome change and just a new place to try some desi food
really really good
very happy for having stopped by with a friend for lunch
very affordable and hot yummy food
and the quantity was more than enough we were quite stuffed and content
the food in itself is yummy we ordered the vegi thali and it came with four big naans
a side of rice and three veggies plus kheer and raita
we also had an option of either soup or salad to start off with
this is one place i will be stopping by often
ambience is nice and staff_is_very_friendly
was a pleasure to dine here and i will_definitely_be_back for more and be sure to recommend_this_place to friends
this was one of the best indina restaurants i have ever been too
my girlfriend recommended the place after her coworker visited the restaurant for lunch
the food was was very flavorful and the service was very welcoming
i couldn't stop stuffing my face with the delicious food
the chicken_tikka_masala is a great favorite
my two kids
ages and
eat it like it's ice_cream
the restaurant was hopping
a great new indian restaurant on_the_west_side
great indian
my favorite part of this restaurant is their lunch menu
they don't do buffets
it is so affordable
so you can take multiple items home to try
for under
my hubby and i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala
shrimp_vindaloo
lamb_biryani
rice dish
garlic_naan
plan naan
and extra raita
all meals come with their cumin toasted basmati_rice
we have enough for at least another meal and half
i am so excited they opened
haven't ate in yet
dinning room looks nice and staff is always wonderful during counter service
embarrassed to say i am new to indian_cuisine
that being said the waitstaff here was incredible in helping me decide by making accurate comparisons
the flavors keep your mind guessing and your palette interested
they get an a from me on portions
affordability
knowledgeable waitstaff and flavor
i'm hooked
i stopped at dhaba for the first time this week
on the good side
the restaurant looks very good and the staff is courteous and efficient
also
our naan_bread was delicious
on the bad side
the very bad side
the lamb_vindaloo was inedible
it appeared_to_be canned tomato_soup
slightly spiced and heated with some lamb dropped in
terrible
the chicken_tikka_masala was barely passable
i think the sauce also came from a jar
at least it tasted like it
i cannot recommend this restaurant for anything other than naan
if you want indian
any_other_indian_restaurant in town would be better
indian food is one of my absolute favorite cuisines for its flavor
spice
and creativitiy
but the price of it versus my grad student budget makes it a special treat only
after seeing dhaba's affordable lunch menu online
i had to try this place out
i'm incredibly happy i did
surprisingly quiet for noon on a saturday
but it just meant that my food came to me faster
the
lamb_curry with basmati_rice was savory and delicious
medium spicy was definitely medium
so as a spice enthusiast
i'm getting hot next time
for the price
i certainly didn't expect a choice of soup or salad with my entree
but ta da
i chose the lentil soup
while it was a very small portion
it was really good
with carrots
vegetables
and lentils in a light broth
the strawberry lassi arrived with whipped cream and a cherry on top
like a strawberry shake
but one sip revealed a great blend of strawberry with a yogurt tang
it went really well with my meal
last but not least
the naan
garlic_naan
it's my weakness
and this is some of the best i've had
got me a basket full of hot naan crammed full of chopped garlic
cilantro
and ghee
and it was wonderful
so for
i got a meat curry
soup
lassi
and naan
there are indian_restaurants that would charge me that for the entree alone
and the quality of the food was the same
if not better
dhaba is definitely worth a visit
my husband and i were in middleton in september for the midwest tandem rally and happened in for dinner after a day of riding
we were absolutely delighted with the food and service
we were told they had just opened that week and sure enough
i couldn't find any place to give them the glowing review they deserved
fast forward to november and we went back for a weekend
get away
from the twin cities and had dinner again here at dhaba
still one of the best meals we've had out and a real bargain too
i actually signed up for yelp just to give this restaurant a review
excellent food
best indian in madison that i've had
nice place
great service
awesome prices
dhaba indian_bistro is so good
i've only ordered take out so far
but the dining_room looks nice
i love all their choices of naan
the samosas and their many vegetarian choices
i'm able to spend about and stretch it to two or three meals
they let you choose how spicy you want curry dishes
which is nice
flavors are vibrant and so good
i might have to order from them for supper tonight just thinking about it
definitely worth a try
a lovely oasis of elegant
yet personal
table service in a mecca of fast_food lunch joints and chain restaurants by greenway plaza
extensive_menu selection
delicate spicing
refined presentation all served by waitstaff who clearly know their menu and are enthusiastic about it
attentive service
yet unobtrusive no
hi
i'm patel
your new best friend
business just genuine care and grace about your experience
all dishes are served promptly
no worries
office park crowd
in lovely crockery and china
with starched cloth napkins and substantial silverware no sporks here creating an atmosphere of grace and relaxation even during a busy lunch hour
quiet enough to hold a conversation without employing lipreading skills another plus
no typical indian buffet scene to ensure you'll get the flu bug either
dhaba also offers take out menu to consider for dinner when commuting home
best basmati_rice in town all very reasonably_priced
so glad we found a good indian restaurant in our area
woo hoo
we order the fish masala
medium spicy
and the chole with garlic_naan and it is soooo delicious
the prices_are_reasonable and the food is so flavorful
also they are very quick when we call to order takeout so we have been very pleased
for all the people stating that this is the best indian food in madison
i can only assume that they have not ever been to maharaja
or swagat
maharaja is the best indian restaurant in madison
and we have been going there for years
but to keep an open mind
we have tried dhaba twice in the past month
first of all
the place itself is nicely_decorated
and the service is excellent
the waitstaff are polite and attentive
and there are plenty of them
but the food is just not that good
other than the naan
every entree comes with either soup or salad
we have gotten their lentil soup both times
which is buttery
thin
and tastes very little like lentils
however
it's not bad
just not very interesting or lentil y
for main_courses
we have had the chicken shahikorma and the chicken_tikka_masala
as well as the spinach
ie palak
paneer
a combo of spinach and farmer's cheese like cubes
and spinach aloo
spinach with potatoes
the first time we tried the chicken shahikorma
i was suspicious that the base of it was actually canned tomato_soup with a few spices added
seriously
it was a very thin sauce
with cut up chunks of nicely cooked chicken_breast in it
but the sauce was not like any shahikorma i've ever had
and it was not interesting
the second time we came we had the chicken_tikka_masala
and strangely enough
it had the exact same sauce as the shahikorma
the two dishes should not
repeat not
have the same sauce
and the chicken_tikka should have been made with chicken cooked in the tandoor oven
but there was no evidence that it had been
we felt a little ripped off that the two dishes use the same sauce
they should not
the spinach dishes were ok
except the potatoes in the spinach aloo were undercooked as in crunchy
i didn't eat them
the naan is great
i admit
but the rest just is not that good
seriously
if folks want really good indian
go to maharaja and get the chicken shahikorma or tikka there
we decided to try it because of the good reviews it's been receiving and we were very impressed
i don't pretend to be an_expert_on_indian food
but this is the best i've ever had
i used to go to swagat
which is also good
and there were a few indian places i frequented when i lived in denver
but this blew them away
the garlic_naan bread is a must
we're still craving it today
i ordered the chicken_tikka_masala on a recommendation and it was awesome and my wife ordered the beef mushroom which was also excellent
we ordered take out and the food was ready very quickly and it's also very reasonably_priced
plus
they give you a discount if you pay in cash
we have a year_old and are always looking for good take out options
dhaba might have just jumped to the top of the list
let me start by saying i'm indian and a bratty snob when it comes to indian food
my family is punjabi like the family that owns the restaurant
so i very much appreciated the mostly north_indian menu
food
yum
we have the non_veg appetizer platter
so good
keema samosa was one of the best i've had
we ordered malai_kofta
chicken_tikka_masala with garlic and chicken naan
we later got some saag
spinach dish
and kheer
naan we ended_up trying garlic
chicken and plain_naan
all kind were great
malai_kofta best i've had in madison
i've tried a few other places and they just don't hit_the_spot the way this one did
chicken_tikka_masala it's the only chicken dish i think is ever worth ordering at an indian restaurant
this dish was literally designed for indian_restaurants
it's not authentic to india rather great britain
so i don't bother with anything else
dhaba's was reallllllly good
saag my mom licked the bowl she was so in love with it
kheer i'm not someone who usually likes kheer but we had some at the end and i stole my mom's because it was just the perfect balance of sweet and creamy
we ordered at a spice_level and found it perfect
i'm not someone that loves spicy food
ie
hyderabi
goan
pakistani food
i can't_handle you
however
i do like some heat
so the was honestly just perfect for my mom
sister and myself
my mom was even having a little bit of a hardtime handling that
but she's been cooking without much spice for the past year
restaurant decor
i really like how they've decorated it and appreciated the folk artwork and punjabi music_playing in the background
totally like a real 'dhaba'
dhaba's are the indian version of fast_food joints
you pull over on the side of the road to a usually sheltered tented area
at least in punjab enjoy the whatever deep friend sloppy delicacy you are offered
usually some sort of comfort_food
back to the review
overall this place is awesome
i'm totally planning to cater for one of my wedding events from them
p
s
if you like taste_of_india on monroe street or brookfield fox valley
the owners family runs those locations as well
two thumbs_up
this place is an amazing find
only one issue is that it is not open monday
great food
staff is fantastic and friendly
came for lunch on a weekday
it was pretty busy
but the service was still quite good
the menu is quite large
with lots of great curry options
chicken madras was excellent
but the cheese_naan wasn't great
this is probably the best indian restaurant i've been to
i would definitely recommend it
i got the chicken_tikka_masala and it was delicious
affordable prices and good service as well
they were very helpful for explaining what a lot of the food on the menu was
i have had nothing but amazing food and fabulous service here
my favorites include the tandori mixed_grill
chicken madras
and chicken_tika_masala
be sure to try the peshwari_naan a sweet kick to the traditional naan
you will quickly become a regular
on a recent search for a great local indian restaurant we discovered two within a mile of our house
both are great but this one is our new favorite
easy to miss from the street
it's worth the search to find
we have been back twice and service has always been prompt and personable
the food is equally fantastic
my husband is a huge_fan_of their tandori_chicken and myself love their mango chicken and chicken_tikka_masala
the
dinner for two
is a great deal and a fun way to try a few entrees too
the naan was also great as well as their lentil soup
we are looking_forward to going back
absolutely the best and most authentic north_indian
mughalai
tandoori
food i have ever eaten
this is a great place
run by folks who seem to have been in the restaurant business for some time
more then anything else
the owners are involved in the kitchen
and that shows in the quality of preparations and serving
highly_recommend this place to anyone looking for good north indian_cuisine
beautiful afternoon sitting outdoors at dhaba
the lunch_specials sounded so good that i had a chicken lunch_special and my wife had the vegetarian
both were made to medium spiciness and were served promptly
cold indian kingfisher beer went well with both
aaa service
we sat outside and enjoyed the day
what a disappointment
the lunch menu is cheaper because they mix in stale food
don't be surprised if you discover stale pieces of meat in your curry
dry
leftover rice or undercooked bread and appetizers
guess thats why its more affordable than the dinner menu
to be fair we have found the food to be surprisingly good at other times
kid friendly too
but its a hit_or_miss
depends on the day and what you order
the quality of the food is terribly inconsistent
ice creams are ok
other desserts not so much
i was born in new york and i've been to authentic indian_restaurants so this doesn't come close
the asian lady at the reception is cold and stand offish
everyone_else is warm and if not for the occasionally well made dishes
i doubt i would go back
amazing service and turn around time for orders
very pleasant staff and the food is incredible
a gem in madison
i ordered from this restaurant like three weeks_ago through the grubhub delivery service
for my boyfriend i ordered the chicken shahi korma and it was decent
he did not like it too much and for me i ordered the paneer masala which supposedly comes with cottage_cheese
onions
tomatoes
raisins and cashews
they call it a royal delight
and all i got was
a royal fiasco
it was a container with a red liquid
which i imagined it was a can or two of tomato paste with cubes of cottage_cheese
i couldn't believe it
not even one raisin or cashew or anything similar to a veggie or nut
i spent for that
as you can imagine
i will never ordered from that place again
the maharaja restaurant it is expensive also but they really do have nice flavorful dishes with veggies on them
all potential for disappointment gets checked at the door and never makes it inside
the friendly owners
portion to price ratio and succulent entrees make this place star awesome
a must for anyone who enjoys indian food
this time while i waited
the owner told me all about uttarayan
one of india's many major festivals
i brought home the chicken_tikka_masala
wife's favorite
and the chicken_vindaloo
along with the veggie appetizer sampler
the samosas are a personal fav and i get those every time
if for no other reason than the sampler of sauces they serve with them
nirvana for me would mean being dipped in those sauces
please don't eat me though
the pakoras
fried veggies in a hummus batter
are also perfectly dippable and probably taste slightly better than i do
for entrees
i ordered the masala mild
but would step that up a notch next time
the vindaloo was medium plus spicy and perfect just spicy enough to make my forehead sweat but not so spicy as to dominate the flavor
the chicken in both entrees was tender white_meat
expertly cooked
eat here
you won't regret it
i just died and went to indian food heaven
seriously though
if i were on death row
that would suck but
this would come a very close second to my family's homemade cincinnati chili
in the us it's very difficult_to_find the quality of indian food you will find in the uk
yes
the uk where i believe chicken_tikka_masala is going to be declared the national dish over fish and chips
you cannot turn a corner without smelling the indian food bliss slap you in the face
and finally
i have found an indian restaurant that has met their match in the us of 'merica
dhaba indian_bistro is ah mazing
so what was for dinner you ask
lobster madras with garlic_naan
no
lobster madras
a little spicier and more flavorful in my mouth
was not on the menu
but they made it
no questions asked
i knew the vindaloo was too spicy and the masala too weak for my buds so
they just smiled and brought out a beautiful dish full of those indian flavors i have missed so much
too bad they're not in my hometown
i'd be there once a week
minimum
i think i could eat here every day and not get bored
the staff is informative and helpful
the samosas are brought with a sampler of sauces
each one is fantastic
it is mouth_watering good
the garlic_naan is very tasty
my husband's co_worker ate here everyday for months while she was here for business
i can see why
the items on the menu are delicious
this place is a must for anyone wanting to experience the best_indian_food_in_town
the food is really high_quality and tastes great
on the weekend
you can get a vegetarian thali for
that gets you
soup
three different vegetable dishes
several pieces of naan
delicious rice
desert
now
this is not your buffet variety food
the thali is freshly cooked
and you can tell
the spices and flavors are sublime
you are offered mild
medium or hot
as desired
so
instead of feeling like you have to get your money's worth at a
buffet
try this place out
if you pay cash
they give you a discount
came recommended by a friend
the staff was very attentive
and the food was delicious
this was my first time i've had indian food
so i was skeptical
but this place was so good
i took my boyfriend
he also loved it
my favorite items on the menu are the garlic_naan and chicken curry
i am not a huge_fan_of indian buffet since the quality tends to suffer at buffets
this one is a welcome change
we usually do carry outs on weekend
paneer masala is very good
their breads are extremely tasty and fresh
each bread had two big pieces so two people can share
there's a good variety of breads available spinach
aloo
garlic etc
would_definitely_recommend_this_place
i would say this is a
than
dhaba calls itself an indian_bistro
and it works for the most part
it serves a choice of salad or soup
dal
with every meal
they have sort of a modern feel
it works
dhabha in terms of menu_items offers nothing special compare to maharaja
mahrani
taj and swagat
minerva does offer a different menu
they just do it much better
also they don't offer the lunch buffet but rather a lunch menu which is also a welcome change
lunch_buffets just don't have the quality or freshness
plus you cannot cater the spicyness
finally
a thing i love is their thali offerings on weekends
meat or vegetarian
i do wish they would let you mix and match the thali with the offered meat and vege dishes
i would be willing to pay a dollar more for it
i am not a vegetarian but enjoy vege food and meat dishes
p
my recommendations
their breads
i don't know why but theirs is far superior to the competition true tandoori flavor
chicken chilli
lamb samosa
spinach and chickpeas
arrived at
with my wife mins before they close for the afternoon and we were refused service
perhaps the food is good
i'll likely not try again
my wife and i went for lunch
the food was very good
traditional indian_fare
done well
food was hot
service was attentive and unobtrusive
we'll go again
unexpected delicious lunch at a place i never heard of
i had this incredible platter
thali
of fabulous vegetarian_dishes
every dish was distinct and robust
the platter included rice
chana_masala
vegetable_korma and palak_paneer
all was accompanied_by a flaky naan and gajar halwah for dessert
i need to bring my pakistani boyfriend aka significant other
partner
boy toy
or whatever you call your guy at age
the next time i come
i would be interested in his take
i plan to take home significant leftovers so he can try them tomorrow
we tried this for lunch on a saturday
we were the first people to arrive for lunch a little after am
the server didn't mention the specials
we saw them on the way out
we ordered appetizers that appeared_to_be reheated a bit
they were not hot or very warm at all
the soup was brought out while we were eating our appetizers
shortly afterward the entrees were brought out while we were still eating our appetizers
the lamb masala had good flavor for left_overs
the same for my wife's vegetable vindaloo
naan is an extra charge
soup is included
all in all
clueless service as far as normal meal service goes
but polite
reheated food passed off as made to order
for a lunch i would rather check out a buffet for less for two people
we are always looking for a good indian restaurant
dhaba is okay
but i'm not sure we'd make a special trip to go there again
we began with samosas this is maybe my favorite appetizer
snack there is
theirs
however
was not up to par at all
first
they came out way too soon
which means they were made previously and reheated
we were there for an early dinner as we did not have lunch
they were on the greasy side
but the worst part was the taste
they had no spice whatsoever
i've had samosas just about in every major city in the country that has a population of people from southeast asia and i expected some spice
they were so bland
it was like eating mash potatoes in a pastry
and very little texture as well
i do want to say that when we sent the back
they were taken off of our bill
the rest of the meal fared better
my husband and i shared an order of chicken_tikka_masala
which was flavorful
we also shared the vegetable mix curry
which also was good
the nan was a tad on the greasy side and cooled off very quickly
becoming a cracker
i think we're still looking for that amazing indian restaurant
this indian food is great
consistent
and delicious
jump in and start eating
when dhaba opened in middleton
it became our weekly take out option
i've never actually been to the restaurant as my co_worker always makes the pickup
over the last six months we have rated each dish to our preferences
here is our list of the best tasting meals that we've had
sadly
we have not yet eaten our way through the whole menu
as long as dhaba makes food
we'll continue eating our way through the menu
we've gone heavy on the lamb and vegetarian_dishes and skipped most of the chicken and beef
that said
here is our list of favorite dishes
all dishes with an asterisk are my personal favs
apps
lamb samosa
mixed vegetarian platter
bread
onion and pepper kulcha
garlic_naan
spinach naan
biryani rice
lamb_biryani
lamb curries
lamb vegetable
lamb masala
chicken curries
chicken_tikka_masala
vegetables
dal makhni
baingan bhartha
paneer masala
matter_paneer
malai_kofta
try dhaba and enjoy them for yourself
the girlfriend and i tried the vegetarian dinner for two
i don't know what was in it
but it was great
the waiter was friendly and didn't laugh at us when we were confused on what to get
signed that guy
this place is so close to my office that it was inevitable to try
so glad i did
the best
most flavorful dishes are served here
the cheese_naan
although not too traditional_indian
is the best i've ever had
their chicken masala is also incredible
the price is right for on the go lunches with generous portions
a bit overpriced for dinner with same menu portions as lunch
and that's why they get stars
another delicious meal
this time with tariq by my side
he really enjoyed his food but will never stop measuring the food against the incredible delights at anmol in milwaukee
that said
dhaba did just fine
we were both over hungry after spending a couple hours at shoe box
we had the allo tikki chat to start
chana_masala and a yummy potato mash together with some sauce
for entrees we had lamb bhartha and paneer masala
there was loads of tender lamb in a wonderful sauce
the paneer are squares of homemade cheese in a creamy masala sauce
both were perfectly seasoned to the medium spicy we requested
we also had the naan that was soft and tasty
tariq had chai which was excellent
not too sweet and i had a mud puppy
dark beer
the beer was a good compliment to the spicy food
the service was excellent
i would have liked a little time to finish my appetizer before the entree arrived
final bill with a full meal of leftovers to go
discount for cash
we shall return
get the to the dhaba
no excuse not to
the food was delicious and well complemented by a wonderful atmosphere and service
the chi
nan
and biryani were to die for
the food was great
unfortunately due to a chef error they put mushrooms
which i'm allergic too
when we requested none
they apologized and gave the meal for free
but i'd recommend being careful still
their chai was good
but i still miss the taste of jaggery
although there are several good indian restaurants_in_madison
there are few to none where i actually want to sit_down and enjoy a meal
so i do take out
dhaba is the exception with its wide open windows and floor plan
and overall pleasing ambience
plus the food was excellent
the veg samosa was perfectly_cooked
and even reheated beautifully in the oven the next evening
the crust is the tough part with samosas
these were flaky with no toughness
the lamb_vindaloo was certainly lively
but not too spicy
i ordered it medium hot and it came that way sort of out of on the heat scale
the lamb was sufficiently tender which is the first thing i look for in an indian lamb dish
i thought the sauce was a bit one dimensional
but still satisfying
could use a side of raita
the baingan bharta was the best i've had yet
it had that beautiful mashed consistency with plenty of zing from the garlic
ginger and eggplant
the chicken spinach dish featured plenty of skinless chicken thigh
almost too much in that i really love that curried indian spinach sauce with just about anything
so the chicken kind of dominated the dish
i ordered ginger naan which was sprinkled with cilantro and was both tasty and useful for sopping up the delicious sauces
caution
yelp had this place listed with a full bar
now corrected
which was wrong
wine and beer only
we will be back when in that part_of_town
the ambience and table settings are comfortable
i won't have my sights set on a beefeater martini now that i know
i look_forward to exploring more facets of dhaba's reliable cuisine
this weekend we ventured out to an indian restaurant that has received lots of love from yelpers
though a little bit far from where we live
it was worth a trip
coming at
the restaurant only had some customers inside
i love the ambience and the decoration
pretty
neat and clean
when we walked to our table
my eyes are set to the announcement on the wall that says
' if you pay in cash
you'll have a off for lunch and a off for dinner
fair enough
once we were seated
the waiter came right away and brought the menu
four of us chose one different dish so we could try four different meals
we had quite a variety of meals
naan garlic
fish vandaloo
chicken curry
shrimp_curry
lamb_biryani as the main_courses
samosa and lentil soup for appetizers
for the drinks
we had mango_lassie and chai
was a good experience
the price is reasonable too
we'll_be_back
food
we ordered the lamb_vindaloo and paneer masala
the waiter asked us on a scale from how spicy we wanted it
we both said
the paneer masala had a little bit of heat but the lamb_vindaloo was not spicy at all
i thought vindaloo was inherently spicy
service
was poor
it was pm on a friday_night
there were a few parties waiting to be seated
but the host did not bother keeping track of who was there first
after being seated
we waited for minutes before someone came to our table to get us water and take our orders
the food took about minutes to an_hour to arrive
the waiter did not come by at all after taking our order or dropping off our food
finally
it was just as difficult finding someone to bring us our check
we get it
you're super popular and busy on a friday
work on your customer_service
either hire more staff so each table can get the attention it deserves or train your staff better
dhaba is out of the way for me and i probably will not return
there are other restaurants with better service that are closer to me
this walking distance from hotel hilton garden which was nice
i wanted to try out authentic_indian_food
this place was good
atmosphere quiet
nice and ok to eat by yourself
service was also good
now the food too many choices but i ended_up getting chicken marsala with bread with mixed ginger and yogurt
very good just wanted it to be more spicy
my boyfriend introduced me to dhaba indian_bistro a few months back and i have been a fan ever since
i have yet to have a bad experience with either the food or service
the staff_is_very_friendly and definitely remember regular customers
i really enjoy the basmati_rice
one thing that i do like about dhaba over my favorite lunch spot curry in the box is that they do not use jasmine rice
while i do like jasmine rice
the basmati_rice is a better fit for the curry
long grain rice blends very well with the thickness of the curry
they offer a large variety of curries ranges from types of curry's and spice_levels
the work on a scale of spiciness
with being the hottest
let me just say that i have gotten a yellow shrimp_curry dish on a scale and it was spicy so be warned
a scale of is your safest bet
my boyfriend who loves spicy food can barely withstand a
they offer quite a bit of curries
shrimp
chicken
beef
lamb
goat
etc
i must admit that i am not the biggest fan of their cheese roti bread
i definitely prefer curry in the box roti bread over dhaba
however
dhaba's bread is more thicker making it easy to dip the bread into the curry and eat
their prices do go up during dinner
even though i've only gone during their lunch hours
i was told by a regular that their serving sizes aren't any different from lunch to dinner so keep that in mind
it's a nice outing for people who really enjoy indian food and or curry
i know for some people
the smell of curry really turns them away from eating at places like such but the restaurant does a great job with
hiding
the smells
curry can be very overwhelming but the aroma when you dine ad dhaba is very inviting
i would give them a
stars
my boyfriend and i absolutely love this restaurant
the service is quick and the wait_staff is very friendly and professional
try the garlic nann it has cilantro
i usually get the chicken_tikka_masala
you can order the food from mild to spicy on a scale of
this was the first place i ever had indian food
i greatly enjoyed the chicken_tikka_masala
i went back quite a few times because i worked across_the_street
i've since had other_indian_places and i can say this is the best i've had yet
the cheese_naan was on point
the service was superb
very friendly always
they even let us know that they have
off the charts
spicy
the hottest they have would rate maybe a on the thai spice_level
so if you request off the charts they give you some extra spice to add on your own
small little place that was very clean and modern
ordered the lamb_vindaloo extra_spicy and it wasn't very spicy
service was a little slow and they only gave_us one serving of rice for two dishes
had to ask for another
but it took a while to get the attention of our server
food was good
but not spicy like requested and like it says on the menu
tried this restaurant on a wednesday night
we didn't encounter any of the issues the other reviewers had
service was fine
our waitress was attentive
friendly and prompt
there were only a few other diners present
many indian
so that's a good sign
decor is ok
felt a little 's to me
but the restaurant is spacious and the backs of the booths are high enough that you can't see over them
a plus
bollywood music_videos show on a couple of tvs
food was a couple dollars more than we're used to spending
but i had the chicken_tikka
dry
off the appetizer menu which was entree sized and my friend had a cauliflower curry
gobi
the vegetable_samosas were good and they offered us a variety of chutneys
which were more like sauces than a traditional
chunky
chutney tomato
mint and coconut
all good
garlic_naan was good
too
biggest complaint is the use of plastic dishes
and why there are chinese_food options on the menu is beyond me
stick to one cuisine
we both agreed the food we had was good and we'd consider returning here
this place isn't bad
i've never dined in
only ordered take out
the staff is nice
and the interior is pretty attractive with beautiful flooring and a soothing atmosphere
minus the tv
their garlic_naan is usually excellent
but the other dishes i've tried
baingan bartha and chole palak
are generally a bit too salty for my tastes
i've eaten here a handful of times
and the saltiness is consistent
i might stop here again sometime
but i'll be checking out the other nearby indian options first
delicious chicken_tikka_masala
nice decor
lots of vegetarian_options
spicy
if you request it
went there for the first time with my boss and a group of coworkers from india
we had the lunch buffet and the food was very good
sadly they didn't have golab jamun
the fluffy cheese balls soaked in syrup
neither i saw the free_chai most indian_buffets have
i like both because in other indian_buffets i sweeten my
free
chai with golab jamun syrup
well
fulla a
's review says this is food from the chennai area
maybe chai and jamun golab are not from there
ok
back to the food
they had interesting and varied options
all of them very tasty
and also had good options for vegetarian_dishes
paneer dishes and vegetarian biryani
i don't remember the names but i tried almost everything and it was very good
they had like different chicken dishes
soups
salad
and various other items
and they bring potato dosai to your table
the hubby and i went there for dinner last_night
they only seem to have the buffet for lunch
so we ordered from the regular menu
we shared chicken_tikka_masala
it comes with white rice
and garlic_naan
everything was very good
the chicken_tikka was delicious
the sauce was the tastier and creamier we have ever had
i noticed it had like pieces of green herbs
usually the tikka sauce in other places is just orange like color
this one had dark small pieces
service was good as well
our hostess and server were young girls and they were very polite and stopped by several times
we will be back even though it is quite a drive
weekday lunch buffet
stopped in here today to try the buffet
joined by arlin b
norm r
mike c
this place is really nice inside
especially the bathroom
no
really
i started_off_with
appetizer
it was a stuffed orange thing
sorry
i don't know what was on the outside or inside of it
but it was good
then it was on to the two soups
one of which was very spicy
whoops
i failed to write down the names of them too
large plates were provided
to me that speaks of
help yourself to all the food you like
i appreciated them
the chicken curry tandoori_chicken were good
especially the pulav
fancy rice
there was also chow citolo kootu
a tasty lentils dish
aloo mutter
potatoes etc
more
about food items in all
after a bit we were each treated to a dosa by our server lady
the food tends toward the spicy here
so i wouldn't recommend it for most kids
there were also some negatives for me
the naan_bread was plain sitting out cold in a serving tray rather than being brought piping_hot to the table
there was no option of garlic flavored
my favorite
the soups other bowl friendly dishes had to go into little stainless steel cups
yes
i've seen them at some other indian_buffets
but i don't like them
i like medium sized china bowls because they are emotionally warmer and not so warm
hot
for your fingers trying to carry them to the table
there were no
treats
to speak of
beyond the dosas and a dessert that looked like cream of wheat
wasn't
it tasted ok
but there was no mango juice
no indian tea and no gulab_jamun
monkey balls
numerous empty trays occupied serving area
perhaps they are used for the
buffet on weekends
but they yell
stingy
to the weekday diner
the opposite of what the big plates were trying to say
soooo
all in all
it's stars from here for this one
while it's not
bad
really
i think india_palace just a block away is a better choice
weekday lunch buffet
i guess it was a good thing that it was rather cold and rainy when i came here for a little buffet lunch uye with rand h
mike c and arlin b
i enjoyed the food but be aware that heat_level of the most of the food was medium to medium hot which i like
but might be a bit daunting for some people
i particularly enjoyed the chicken curry
the egg masala and the lentil dish
and found the other dishes to be quite good
the server was very attentive
and the crispy dosas she brought to our table was a nice addition to our meal
at about bucks
the price of the lunch buffet is about the same as most other indian_buffets in the city
but the spacious
sparkly clean setting brings this place a tad above the rest for me
they really have good south_indian dishes especially kotthu paratto
spciy chicken garvy
but i would rate the buffet as average in terms if taste and variety
and i love their biryani
staffs are really nice
chennai chettinaad palace is my new favorite indian restaurant
the lunch buffet is changed up every day
they always have so many delicious dishes to choose from
be sure to have the dosa
the food here is just like the food i had when i was in south_india
great place to try things you have never tried before
my gratitude to sarabear b
the hopi have blue corn piki
the southwest giant flour tortillas
chenai chettinad palace has masala_dosai
for me
that giant roll of ultra thin giant masala crepe piki tortilla with a dab of potato dosai was worth the visit
this is a pleasant
visually inviting place
the booth for our business conversation tall
quiet and comfortable
as others mention
service was attentive
the food was decent
i cannot name all the dishes in the weekday lunch buffet
we all ate veggie
finished the meal with the dosai
and were quite satisfied
went for lunch on a monday with very low expectations but was wowed by the ambience and good food
fantastic
tried this restaurant times for buffet
luckily all times food was too good
specially spicy chicken tandoori and dry black paper chicken
just make sure you go there before pm for lunch buffet else most of the item would have already finished
they have improved a lot compared to opening week month
the dosas are good compared_to_other indian_restaurants near by
now they have kothu paratha
service is good and improving a lot
we went here last_night for the first time and had a fantastic dinner
my husband ordered a spicy vegetable soup and we got two orders of chicken_tikka_masala
he didn't like his soup and said it tasted like spicy water with some spices
so we will try something different next time
the chicken_tikka_masala was awesome
but the rice it came with was pretty bland
although i felt it was fine when paired with the masala
the garlic butter naan we ordered was seriously amazing
and dipping it in the tikka masala sauce was the best part of the meal
our server was very sweet and very efficient
however they were definitely understaffed for the amount of people dining
i think she may have been serving most of the tables in the place
so it took a little longer to get everything than it probably should have but it was never so long that it was ridiculous
the restaurant itself is beautiful
very clean and well designed
you would never be able to know such a nice place is hidden in the shopping mall
there was plenty of open parking and it seemed like the place didn't get busy until
ish
definitely a later crowd
our price for the soup
two dinners
naan and tip was
which was very reasonable
we will absolutely be back soon
went for buffet long lines
food very greasy
not good
frequently ran out of food
no more visits here
went to sunday lunch buffet
buffet opened at noon
usd per_person
the chicken_tikka_masala and paneer butter masala were flavorful
the potato was nice too
the naan was perfectly textured
their atmosphere is classy
service is pleasant
the water does not taste like tap water and is actually tastes like soft mineral water
not iced
i think my boo and i were the only non indian pakistani there lol
clean
fresh
usd for weekend lunch buffet
i would def go again
i think i found myself a new fav place
this place is ok ok
the food is but the service is pathetic
i have been here times and everytime the service is equally bad
if the owner is listening via yelp
please you have a good thing going on but the service is ruining your restaurant
please please improve on the service factor
try chinese_food here
very good
had the lunch buffet
best indian i've had on_the_west_side by far
i've had other indian_restaurants
and none of them have come close to being this good
first positive sign
everyone in the place was indian
second positive sign
all the food was spicy
had to ask for a masala_dosa for my daughter so that she could eat
delicious
will be back soon
there was a tv that was too loud
i really hate having tv on at places
let alone with volume on
someone asked they turn it down
and they i think didn't understand the english well enough to comply
could be an issue going forward
i took my spouse out for indian food this evening
rather than our usual we wanted to try a new location and chennai chettinaad did_not_disappoint
we tried a variety meat and vegetarian_dishes
the chicken_tikka_masala was flavorful and mildly spicy
my go to
heat
dish
lamb_vindaloo
was flavorful with tender chunks of lamb
while i had ordered the maximum spice_level what i received was a medium
we also ordered a vegetarian dosa which was done with the same level of care as the other dishes
the last dish ordered was biryani
the biryani was a solid good
i look_forward to seeing what it is like with added
heat
the service at the restaurant was good to very good
all in all a very charming restaurant whose attention to detail showed in everything from the excellence of the dishes to the decor
a lot nicer than we thought it would be since the location was a kyoto bowl before
the food was great
it was a little too quiet
they didn't have any music_playing
service was nice and the food was tasty and decently priced
this place is somewhere that i will not return
after seeing reviews here
i thought that going to this restaurant for the lunch buffet was a good idea
however
a good portion of the food was not palatable
dishes that were okay
the rice
chicken_biryani
cold but flavorful
chicken_tikka_masala
some of this chicken was very overcooked
but at least palatable
naan
gulab jabun
like a donut hole delicious
dishes that were not decent
appetizer
some donut looking thing
paneer mutter masala
this is usually one of my favorite dishes
but was disgusting
fish
i don't know why i tried fish at a buffet
but not impressed
curry chicken
i thought just the service would be bad
and it was
i was expecting that
did not get a refill
this was somewhat expected with the comments on here that i read before choosing this restaurant
i can totally accept poor service if the food tastes good
overall
i paid
for this meal
and did not even eat a full plate because unfortunately on the two plates i did have
not everything was worthy of being put into my body as it would taste so bad going down
i have been eating indian food for over years
i love it and this was such a sad food experience
after spending the past summer in berkeley and thoroughly enjoying all of the fabulous indian_restaurants there
it is so disappointing that it so extremely difficult_to_find a decent indian restaurant in the north valley
the last time i enjoyed indian food in phoenix area was when i went to tempe but that is too long of a journey from where i live now
the struggle to find decent indian food in the north valley continues
but i know that i will definitely not be going back to this place
stunningly good and authentic_indian_food
just the right spices
well prepared and reasonably_priced
while visiting scottsdale we realized we needed to get away from there asap
discovered_this_place when traveling west
awesome joint
i thoroughly_enjoyed their gobi chettinaad masala aloo mutter
their mango_lassi was yummy
wish i was able to eat more but i was so full
the waiter who i believe was the owner was super friendly
this place has decent decor for a valley indian restaurant and very average food
the dosas at ananda bhavan or even karaikudi are way better
the service is quite inadequate and even rude at times
quite frustrating
had a very nice dinner here last_night
with great service and lots of delicious food
we had a couple of dosai
a veggie curry and lamb_vindaloo which was delicious
good prices
it was very quiet there so i hope they survive as they are very close and we will be back
in short
tasty
spicy south_indian food
but the quality lacks consistency
nice ambiance
service was bad before
but it has improved a lot now
details
lunch_buffets
been a patron at this restaurant during my year's stay in glendale
lunch_buffets on weekdays has a small but nice menu
i wold recommend their biryani
lunch_buffets on weekends has lot many options
but vegetarians may not find the taste so exciting
i would recommend their fish on weekend buffets
dinner
a la_carte
all curries are prepared with southern spice_levels
which means you will sweat if you order moderate or high spice_levels
uttappam and dosas are well prepared and are served with good cutneys
mini idli's do not come soaked in sambar
biryani
s
are tasty but not as good as bawarchi
near scottsdale
my favorite of all is
schezwan fried_rice
with 'chicken '
i would recommend it for all those who crave ultra spicy food
cons
many times
the same dish did not taste the same when ordered on different days
which means i cannot have a favorite
the service at the beginning of was too bad
i agree with some other yelpers
at times they even forgot some of my orders
but they have improved towards the end of
by and far the most authentic and tasty indian food i have tasted so far in the us
i had come all the way from albuquerque to try their food and every dish we ordered was very well prepared that i felt that i was back in india
even though there are some delays in service at peak hours
it is obvious largely owing to their awesome food
i will come back again to phoenix just to try the food here
hats off to the team there
outstanding lunch buffet
i am giving this restaurant stars based_on the lunch buffet and cleanliness
i come here often
about times a month
with family or friends for the amazing selection at their_lunch_buffet
friday through sunday is my favorite time to come because the food is much spicier
beware
this place is packed on those days
if you prefer it on the mild side then stick with the monday thursday buffet or come during dinner hours when you can order it however you prefer
i have noticed that the people in my party are usually the only non indian people dining here
which is an excellent sign that the food is authentic
i've never been to india
so unfortunately i cannot say for certain
this restaurant is always very clean
the service can be hit_or_miss
sometimes we get fantastic service and other times not so much
but that may be due to a communication barrier that the food more than makes up for
tips
great place for vegetarians who like it spicy
yes
they do also serve meat
be sure and try rasam sambar soups
they are both delicious
due to the service
i will_never_go_back
i love indian food and have been to quite a few places in the valley
chennai's food was average
when we actually received what we ordered
dinner service
pros
relatively fast turn around following ordering
food was pretty good
if nothing_to_write_home_about
cons
servers had no_idea_what was on the menu
they came back twice to ask if
that 'chinna' thing
was a soup and then seemed to point at the menu at random
asking
is that it
channa_masala
it's a pretty ubiquitous dish
and i can show it to you on the menu if you hand it to me
of the dishes we ordered
came accurately
were entirely inaccurate
e
g
chaat when we'd ordered a curry dish
and never showed_up at all
they tried to charge us for dishes we didn't order in addition to those we did
we had to ask the waitress for water x before she brought it
if you're going to go there
go for the lunch buffet
the less you have to interact with the servers
the better
ok
the reviews were rather depressing and we decided on indian buffet for lunch
we decided on chennai chettinaad palace and was not disappointed in the least
atmosphere was charming
unlike it predecessor tokyo express
service was wonderful and the food very flavorful and exciting
my only agreement with other reviewers is that most of the dishes
of which there is a great selection
would be that it is just a touch beyond
comfortable spicy
when we left
our table was the only empty table there
it was packed with folks waiting both inside and out
we were the only non indian patrons
i would love to review all the different foods
like chili fish and chicken
goat and more
please accept my apology as i hardly know what they were or their ingredients
but the food is wonderful
try it
its worth it
dined here last_night
the food was very good indeed
lamb kurma
chicken saag
and a few other dishes
well presented and quite flavorful without being overwhelming
five_stars
the servers were not up to that standard
sadly
they were certainly inexpert and seemed inexperienced
i'll be back though
the annoyance of bumbling service was far outweighed by the quality of the delicious food
my favorite indian place in the valley
i've had them all
and it isn't close
spicy
and delicious
the lunch buffet on the saturday was simply superb
i went with low expectations because i am from nova
dc metro where there are tons of indian_restaurants but chennai chettinad really surprised me
food was pretty authentic and had tons of veg options
dosa was missing in the buffet but desserts was a surprise
fish_curry
palak_paneer
goat_curry chicken biryaani were the best
everything was tasty and would_definitely_come_back here if i visit phoenix
keep it up guys
tasty
spicy food
we love_this_place for its indo_chinese and south_indian dishes
rest of the stuff is very inconsistent but is good most of the times
the service was extremely bad when it comes to the waiters
it has improved a bit now
but i would at least expect my server to say a 'hi'
which youll never get here
most of the servers are rude and they will find a way to mess up your order each time
food arrives very slowly on busy days
less for these things n i really feel the management should do something about em
i don't know what to say
i love the food but as everyone says the service is terrible
part of the reason is that the owners steal all of the tips from the waitresses
they make minimum wage
and all the tips go to the owners
i am torn
it is without question my favorite food
but the owners steal from the servers
so i don't think i should eat here
really disappointing
what does one do in this case
the other indian_restaurants around here are terrible
so i can drive to tempe to support better practices for servers
or i can eat here and support thieves with delicious food
awesome indian lunch buffet
if quality of food is important to you
you will love_this_place
even
for a change
i liked the dessert options
the family and i went to this today after seeing the advertisements
my fiance was really excited to go
so i agreed hoping this would be a nice break from the norm and a great way to spend an early saturday evening
we arrived right at pm
bought our tickets
adults
kids no kids discount
and entered the festival
we were immediately grabbed by a hard sell timeshare company and it took more effort than i planned on spending to break away
the festival was relatively empty
granted it was early in the day
and there were a few open booths
one major disappointment is we found no japanese food
which i was hoping for
vietnamese
filipino
and thai were all well represented
as well as a couple hawaiian fusions
but that is about it
the food trucks were definitely a highlight
we both chose truck norris and it kicked ass
see separate review
as the day progressed
the crowd only mildly picked_up but the entertainment slightly elevated
all told
we left at about
pm after a roughly expenditure
i believe the event is priced on the high side
but was enjoyable
this is the second annual
hopefully they will gain momentum in years to come
we will definitely give them a shot next year as well
note
bring cash
atm fee is
and no one takes credit
did someone say food festival
asian cuisine
las_vegas asian food festival here i come
access and parking at silverton casino was easy and we had no problem
entrance thru casino
valet was helpful and gave precise directions
follow signs
pass aquarium
pass gift shop and hang a right
entry pool area where you are greeted_by event staff who will direct you where to go
i picked_up tix at will call thru vip entrance since i won tix through a drawing via yelp
thank you thank you
arrived late afternoon
sun wasn't beating down
so the festival was shaded for the most part
i was expecting it to be crowded and have long lines but i'm guessing it was their down time and it wasn't that busy nor did i have to wait in hour long lines thankfully
scoped and did walk thru to figure_out what to eat
the layout was nicely organized and made it easy to figure where everything was
food trucks towards carnival side l
a
and our local vegas ones represented the gourmet food trucks
food vendors towards freeway side filipino
hawaiian
thai
chinese
korean
vietnamese
and indian cuisines represented
oh and italian ice and shave ice
well more like snow cone textured ice to me
see pix
honestly i'm really not a fan of food served up from warming trays that look like they have been sitting out
not sure how long it's been sitting out so i'm more likely to skip out cause that's what they had
mid section had retail vendors
a caged fighting area
and the dj blasting music
carnival rides and mickey d's towards back area
dining areas there were three of them
the tented vip one
you need your vip pass to gain access to here
banquet tables with apps were being served when we were there around ish
the sake and bar started later on
lucky i read via website the info so i timed arriving here perfectly
the area towards the back had high top tables where you can stand
it wasn't shaded but at the time we went the sun was low enough that it shaded the area
the other dining_area was tented with tables and chairs
plenty of seating
being the clean freak that i am
i appreciate that the dining_area was pretty clean for an outdoor event
they had festival staff who bussed and clean the areas continually the time we spent there
the garbage cans were emptied also
just little things like this made it more aesthetically pleasing
the variety of entertainment lineup during the time we were there varied
hot hula fitness just finished up when we arrived
when we sat_down to eat there was thai acrobatics followed by a tai chi demo
then ronald mcdonald telling corny jokes and performing magic tricks
the kids both young and young at heart seemed to enjoy the show and that's all that mattered
i ended hitting up the truck norris
fluff ice and sin city cupcakes
i have an obsession with food trucks what can i say
love the unique and different twists of hawaiian filipino food and desserts from truck norris and fluff ice who are both from the los angeles area
and sin city cupcakes
alcohol infused cupcakes
need i say more
i'll follow up with separate yelp_reviews for them
ive learned from attending past foodie festivals to take cash since some of the vendors and food trucks do not take debit credit cards
so bring cash with you
the admission price initially might scare people away but note it's good for both days with in out privileges
kids get in free if they are a certain height
so tell the taller kids to bend at the knees a lil bit so you're under the
limit
haha
you can pick_up a coupon off at a mcdonald's
one of the sponsors for this event plus part of the proceeds go to a good cause
our local ronald mcdonald house
i found all this info on the website before i came
so it is a good value if you take advantage of attending the weekend
we enjoyed our afternoon and will be back
i am a big_fan of festivals
and also happened to be lucky enough to win a pair of vip tickets via yelp
thanks again misti
so i decided to check out the asian food festival
upon approaching the silverton
i saw tons of rides and booths set up and i was ready to have fun and eat a lot
upon walking into the festival
i was in food para para paradise
i saw many familiar food vendors
as well as some new ones and i was eager to eat a lot
for my main meal
i decided to try some filipino food since i've been craving it for a while now
the food was tasty and reminded_me_of my best friend's food from back home in california
having the vip tickets was also a huge bonus to the fair
who could say no to comp drinks
i am definitely looking_forward to next year and the reunion i'll have with all the delicious food
i do love_this_place but i'm only going for stars as this review is based_on takeaway
not the full restaurant experience
it has been opened now for about a year and replaced oscars on slateford road
there is a restaurant which seems to do pretty good business
i popped in before on a friday for a takeaway and it was pretty full which is always a good sign
with lots of other popping in to collect takeaway too
their takeaways are awesome
first visit at new years was for meal deal for and we added extra bits
pakora
naan
extra rice
on to make it a meal for seriously
there was tons of food
even feeding three with pub munchies
meant there was still another meal and a bit left for another day
meat is cooked amazingly we had a chicken_korma and there was a lamb dish with mint whose name escapes me
i would never order lamb normally and didn't intend on even trying it but it was awesome
totally melt in the mouth gorgeousness
i tried to look for it last_night but probably missed it on the menu due to tiredness and starvation so i opted for a chicken dupiaza
it was lovely
subtly spiced tomatoey sauce with huge chunks of tender chicken and slices of red and green peppers and onions yum
i ordered boiled rice to go with it and when i opened the bag at home
not only did i have my order
but a little tubs containing a chopped onion salad and some mango_chutney
i think this is a jashans thing as there is always some kind of salad and sauce thing that comes extra which is a nice_touch
so
yep
jashans is worth checking out
there are deals on for the restaurant on sundays
and lunchtimes during the week
if you fancy a bargain lunch treat
the staff are lovely and the restaurant is really nicely_decorated
very modern
but with lots of red
orange and gold accents to reflect the indian and bangladeshi theme
i was really happy to see a curry_house open on slateford road
in part it always struck me as odd that there are
now i think
chinese style takeaways or restaurants yet no indian
however jashans is a mixed bag
i can't fault the quality of the meat and the milder curries are decent however the spicier dishes lack any differentiation outside of an extra chopped chili or some chunks of garlic
they all use the same base sauce giving no depth to the flavour
perhaps the demand simply isn't there for the spicier dishes and thus when one is ordered it is an exception
however this doesn't excuse that it feels like there is a lack of care in these dishes
jashans is ideal for those that enjoy milder curries
but if_you_are_looking for something a little hotter
madras or similar
there are definitely better places
it was sunday_night
it was late
it was cold
it had been snowing on and off all weekend
neither me or my boyfriend could face cooking dinner so we decided to finally try jashans which had opened up down the street from his flat a number of months_ago
we phoned our order in and headed over to pick_it_up
i was a bit shocked entering the restaurant itself
as it really rather quite posh looking
all rich sumptious colours and dark wooden tables
i was definitely impressed
perhaps less so when we had at least three different waiters come up to us to ask what our take away order was
um we already ordered and we are just waiting for the food now
it also took about three attempts to pay
about minutes after our arrival though
we had paid and the food was brought to us and we hopped in the car to head home
i unpacked the items which included poppadums
onion salad
garlic chicken
green herb chicken
saag aloo
pilau_rice
and a peshwari_naan
i did like that the food came in tupperwares which meant for less chance of an accidental spillage while carrying it from car to flat
but i found that the food was barely on the hot side
more warm moving to room temperature
to be fair the curries were perfectly nice and i really enjoyed the naan
it was lovely and coconuty and sweet but without that weird hideous orange dyed coconut colour that you usually get
but i felt_like this place fell short of the other amazing curry_houses that edinburgh has to offer as i can really only describe my meal as nice and not overly memorable
it was also a bit more expensive than i would have expected for a takeaway
so sadly
it's only a ok and i may encourage my boyfriend to order from a different establishment the next time we opt for an indian to take away
awesome banquet meal
each every sunday
had never hard of this place until a few ago and now i'm a regular
lovely naan_bread
nice starters and fragrant currys they have
a tapas indian style
great evening out and a great meal
so i have ventured back into jashans twice this year and all i can add to my original review is that the hotter curries have improved enough to warrant another star
i have had a vindaloo and a madras and there were subtle differences in the flavour and just the right difference in heat
tasty
thing is while i am happy to say the restaurant has improved
this could be bad for my waistline as i live just round the corner
oh well
it is always good to have another option for curry
discovered this delightful place last_night a choice of main_dishes designed to be shared by two we had a chickpea and sweet potato curry platter which was delicious and fun to share
we sat on the cute little balcony which has coloured voiles on the windows but had a peek inside downstairs they play an old classic movie as folks dine and there is a chilled bar area with low seating
colourful decor and a cosy atmosphere
the food is franco indian and there is only one vegetarian choice
the desserts are good too
knickerbocker glory style but with a difference
my partner had a mango explosion and i chose a banana and toffee combo
the also make a mean mojito
it is reasonably_priced and the staff are friendly
cozy and trendy
a global experience
sensory escape
le passepartout was simply amazing
we walked in to a little oasis that is tucked_away off the royal mile on old fishmarket close
and we were welcomed to this fantastic new restaurant
the main dining_area is cosy and has beautiful
bright coloured pink walls and simple tables with lovely pillows and decorations
it feels like like you are stepping into a lovely moroccan restaurant or a southeast asian restaurant it is a mix of both and a fantastic fusion of cultures
and of course foods
the menu is short but overwhelming in deciding what to choose because there are so many fantastic choices
you can either have many starters as tapas or a main that is a sharing platter for two
there are no mains for one
for for one you could go tapas_style or have a very big dinner
for an odd number of people like when we had three tonight
it was perfect sharing a variety of tapas starters and one main sharing platter
for the starters
or
there is a fantastic pulled pork
an excellent moroccan chicken
chili_chicken strips
marinated minted lamb
only
jalape o cream cheese fritters
deep_fried squid and chorizo and spiced bean stew
we had six and they were each amazing
they are small but at great prices and are absolutely_delicious
we had the perfectly exquisite whole scottish lobster with thai green chili sauce and singapore style noodles and vegetables
the dish was large and plentiful
and it was to die for
for
it was one of the more expensive main
for two remember
but still a great deal for how much there was and how fantastic it was to have a whole lobster cooked so perfectly
my only quibble with it was that it was quite messy and also very hard to manage the lobster that was somewhat cracked into pieces but could have done with lobster cracker as it was difficult and hard on the hands to get all of the tasty meat out
other mains included slow roasted lamb
for the sharing platter for two is a great deal
and a scottish t bone steak
desserts were good but very cream oriented and few chocolate options
i had the chocolate mousse drenched in ice_cream and whipped cream
while the others had a liquid dessert of espresso coffee ice_cream with cognac and creme de cacao
the environment here is lovely and relaxed with candle light tables low ceilings
there is a special alcove for two to snuggle in while they dine
and a great downstairs area for a different but also lovely atmosphere
and it is also great for groups
i love_this_place and will_definitely_be_back
it is a fun place with friends and also perfect for a romantic date
what a strange evening
good food
tiny
hot venue
disorganised but friendly_staff
we arrived and were offered a table 'downstairs' ie in a wee
dark
empty room with a tv screen covering one wall
it's the rolling stones
said our waitress
we said
em
can we see upstairs
which was bright and full of people
very bright and very full it's a hot
pink
tiny cave
make your own analogies
and we had to limbo dance into our seats but
so far so good
we ordered
and sat chatting
and sat
minutes_later
the waitress admitted they'd forgotten our order
and were just putting it on now
man
so
we were a bit fed up by this point
eventually
they did bring some food
and it was delicious squid
lamb kofta
and some chorizo and bean stew to start
and while we were still eating those
our shared lobster main arrived
is it so odd to want a clean plate
when my starter was a runny
spicy stew
apparently
the lobster was tasty
i haven't had a whole lobster before
so it was quite a challenge
but fun
and we just got stuck in and messy
and enjoyed it
then ate the delicious noodles it came with
the food really was pretty good
and in the end
they took the wine off our bill as an apology for the wait
so we had three starters
a lobster and a bottle_of_wine for
which is not to be sneezed at
but too hot and pink and bothersome for me to go back
not quite a review
as i've not managed to contact them to book a table
but they are at least now on twitter
https
twitter
com tuktukedinburgh
the web site isn't up to much just yet
http
tuktukonline
com
i am really looking_forward to eating there
hopefully soon
had to give it a star_rating
so have gone with a moderate ' '
but note that i've not tasted any food yet
so
i sort of feel bad to review this restaurant this early
as others have mentioned how they've only opened recently and are working out the kinks
my friend and i went here for dinner after work on a thursday about weeks after opening and were very excited to come here after seeing the restaurant's tuk tuks wandering the streets
first of all
it's a great location in the heart of tollcross
across from king's theatre and conveniently next to a co op when you want to take advantage of tuk tuk's byob policy
the branding they've developed is very smart and makes it look like it's part of a chain
after asking one of the waitstaff who is a school friend of the owner
he said they hope to eventually expand in this way
the interior is very stylish but also has an old building charm
we only discovered upon visiting the toilets that the building must have used to be a bank
as there's a huge vault door in the ladies'
the music was also very fun
who doesn't love a bit of bollywood
the major problem with our visit was the wait for the food
we_were_seated_immediately when we arrived
but because there was a large_group that had sat_down not long before us
the kitchen had a hard time dealing with the number of orders
our server continually apologised for the delay and even brought out complementary poppadoms when we asked for something because we were starving after waiting for such a long time
i would think that once they have their service down
they would aim to bring out the tapas_style dishes as they're ready
but we mostly got ours all at once as in a normal restaurant
the food was good
each dish came in a perfect portion_size considering one person is recommended to order dishes
there was this mysterious sauce that seemed to appear drizzled on most of the dishes
my friend didn't much care for it but it wasn't listed on the menu so she didn't know not to ask for it
the dishes also came in these small metal dishes that
while stylish
were very hot to the touch
it made it difficult if you wanted to pour a curry over rice or to pass a dish over the table to someone
at the end of the meal
though
the bill was surprisingly affordable for the amount we ordered
though at that time they could only take cash as payment
luckily
it's located right next to the co op
i plan on going back here because i think they have a lot of potential and room to improve on this one experience
i'm excited_to_see this local business grow
hopefully for the better
ok
never heard of it until taken by friends
looks pretty good
friendly_staff
food though takes it to the next level
we had quite a few veggie and meat options
chicken lollipops
lamb_chops
railway lamb etc all went down well
tarka dal was superb as was the paneer and masala chips
food came reasonably quickly in tapas_style dribs and drabs
of us had a feast and it came to just over
obviously booze not included
i will_be_returning
really enjoyed my visit here
indian tapas mean you can order a number of dishes
two of us had dishes plus rice and naan which was enough to fill us up
cost with tip
of the dishes
were fantastic
one pretty good and one very average
the lamb was a bit tough and the sauce contained too much ghee
overall though the food was good and just that bit different to your ordinary indian restaurant fare
i'd definitely go back
ecclectic decor and music makes for a good atmosphere
i recommend booking at the weekend as it was completely full on the saturday we visited
byob which you can buy at the co op just next_door
tuk_tuk is fresh
bright and new
offering a street_food spin on indian food
essentially
what they have on offer is tapas_style indian
so it's not a style with which you'll be entirely unfamiliar
it's early days for the place
and i don't feel they've really found a range of dishes that will wow customers
but they're starting from a solid foundation
so have every chance to develop into a really good wee place
overall
we said
tuk_tuk is worth a visit
but i'd be surprised if you're blown_away by what they have on offer
the idea is a good one
but the quality and or originality needs to be cranked up a notch if the place is going to put broad grins on the faces of diners
for now
it's quietly pleasing
which is quite a good starting point
i look_forward to visiting
later in the year
to see how the menu has evolved and how they've developed their offering
sitting on a prominent corner opposite the kings theatre
tuk_tuk indian street_food is an odd mix of modern minimalist marketing and traditional simple street_food
it works on a tapas_style approach they recommend two people order between and dishes and work from there
it's not licensed so byob is the order of the day
no corkage charge
so
last_night
when i was the lead guitarist out of the shadows
we decided to pop in here after picking_up a rather nice bottle of red on the way
when it comes to tapas
i come over all carol vorderman and select random dishes from different sections without much attention to what's actually in them
sometimes it works and sometimes my food allergies get the better of me
on this occasion i think it's safe to say it worked out reasonably well
we had
fish cakes
not that great
yes they were shaped like cakes and had an 'aroma de la mer' but somehow the subtle flavours were lost amidst the rest
they would have benefited from some kind of dipping sauce
they weren't that hot either
lamb kebabs that could have done with a yoghurt dressing but otherwise were pretty decent
chilli garlic chicken
fantastic
a lamb_curry
almost as good as the chilli garlic chicken
hakka chilli paneer
just confusing
think singapore noodles meets rogan_josh
it tasted ok but somehow my senses were working overtime to comprehend what i was seeing and what i was tasting
on the side we had rice and garlic_nan
both good
we finished off with a couple of chai teas
so in summary
i think tuk_tuk is probably a decent 'try me' kind of place
but i don't think there's enough here to keep me coming_back for more
yes the bill is quite reasonable
but you've already paid for your booze and it's easy to leave that calculation off the total
as with most tapas ventures there will inevitably be a couple of dishes that don't totally work so you have to focus on the overall appeal of the meal
tuk_tuk is a different sort of indian
tapas_style and set out more like a modern diner than a restaurant
there is a minimalist and bright style that works well with the street_food aim
the food is good
we had a reasonable selection of dishes
meaty and vegetarian
and sides
massala chips
nan and pickle selection
and we all left happy
and full
and it was all fairly inexpensive
in short modern setting
good food and byob
what is not to like
popped in here last_night for some impromptu food after a couple of beers at benetts over the road and we were not disappointed
contemporary decor with lots of asian twists in the theme caught my interest from the outset
really nice roomy space with lots of seating options from tables to massive benches
the menu is mainly tapas with options galore for veggies and vegans too
so thumbs_up from the better half
i opted for the mixed_grill and dare i say it this was better than the kebab_mahal mixed_grill that was my previous bench mark
i managed to try some of the paneer noodles
which were really tasty as were the mixed pickle jars
these are tiny little jars but packed full_of_flavour
all in the of us had a great meal and will be back
d
ahh yes a side note it is byob so if you fancy some vino with your pakora make sure to grab some before you turn up
if not there is a coop and a supermarket close at hand
it's being your own wine and or beer with no corkage
the indian food here is great
and i really enjoy the atmosphere
they say that every person should order dishes but i think that's cray cray
two is enough for me
there's a youthful atmosphere that i like about this place
it's clean
airy
with fun bright orange colours
so very different to what i normally experience at other indian_restaurants
all of them i'm not bothered to sit in
the food tastes fresh
i ordered the railway station lamb and it came in it's own mini pot with an abundance of spinach in the sauce
i thought that was a nice change
generally when you order a curry it mentions things like peppers
spinach
etc
but you never actually see much of vegetables in it
it's mostly just overly oily creamy sauce
my group bought a few bottles of wine to bring
and once our table was cleared
we kept on drinking
what was nice is that we never felt rushed to leave after we finished_eating
it felt_like we stayed an extra hour afterwards and they didn't mind at all
anyways
i know when i want an indian i will be here
railway lamb get
in
ma
bellay
i actually quite liked this place
it's not fancy
kinda looks like it's been decorated by ikea
however for the concept of quick tapas_style indian street_food you wouldn't really expect a plush decor
i came with a group of
organised by me
again
to try somewhere new around the lothian rd area and of course for their byob policy
always a winner at a team night out
i wasn't sure how the menu and concept would go down for such a large_group
the waiter's suggestion of some set options for a per head cost were poo poo'd by the blokes who wanted
their own food
so i had to ask for a bit of paper to write down everyone's choices against their names so we could remember what we ordered and keep track
complicated or what
the waiters were pretty patient with us thankfully
the food turned up at different times
basically it arrived when it was ready
i explained the concept of the place to the guys a million times but there were a few moans from people who didn't have their food when some had dishes
the moans stopped when everyone had at least of their dishes in front of them
the quality of the food was unquestionable though
very tasty
i had mixed pakora
half of it sneakily nicked by a work buddy
butter_chicken and a lamb dish with ginger
the lamb was my favourite
the selection of naan breads were great soft
buttery
crispy
no one had any complaints with the food
the only options that didn't go down as well as the others were the mini indian burgers
well
what do you expect ordering a burger in an indian restaurant
and some kind of cold chickpea mush on crisp things
the people who ordered that option both didn't expect it to be a cold dish and felt the menu description was completely different to what arrived
i'd go back again but in a much smaller group
it's far too complicated keeping track of dishes for large parties
my control freak tendencies were pushed to the limit on this visit
p
s
nice
clean toilets
with toothbrushes
i have been eyeing this restaurant up for ages and finally got the chance to go last_night and it was amazing
such a good selection of small indian tapas plates ranging_from
and everything we had was delicious
they suggested between plates per_person but myself and my friend had between us and we were stuffed
we shared the butter_chicken
so tasty
the fishcakes
somosas
kebab buns
like little burgers
garlic chicken and aubergine and potato and everything just tasted wonderful
such good quality and tasty food
the restaurant is byob as well
on wine and beer
so is great for a bigger group as will keep the costs for dinner down
they also cater for larger groups
when we were in there was a large_group of and there was plenty of room
the restaurant is large too and really well spaced out the decor is quirky with large wooden tables and wire lampshades so it does remind you of grabbing a quick bite in an indian train station
which i loved
they also have bollywood posters on the walls and indian music_playing
making the whole experience that bit more inclusive you could forget for a minute that you were at the top of tollcross
the staff were also really friendly too
this is definitely a new favourite of mine and i have been raving about it to everyone since last_night
tasty food
great choice and lovely surroundings go
i have been thinking about heading to the recently opened tuk_tuk on lothian road for quite a while
i had heard rumours they would come and pick you up in the tuk_tuk if you asked nicely too
the idea behind it is that it is more of a street_food rather than your usual curry experience
there are lots of small dishes that you can chose from and enjoy a tapas_style sharing dinner
they suggest ordering to of the small dishes per_person perfect for sharing
i really like the laid back d_cor and bollywood posters
plus the music is great to
it has a very happy chatty atmosphere to it which creates the right feelings for our
celebration meal
we were all pretty hungry before entering the restaurant
and the delicious smells that hit us as we walked in meant we couldn't wait to sit_down and order
to start we decided to share the chicken lollipops and samosas
the spiced wings are served on the bone and the coating of keralan spices on the beautifully crisp exterior complimented the beautifully tender meat on the inside
the samosas were good but i much prefer the bigger ones you get from the indian shops as they have more filling
it was still a flavourful
moreish starter
leaving us excited for what was to come
we ordered the tandoori meat selection which comprised of lots of meat
it's a bit more expensive at about i think but has different cuts of lamb and chicken all very well cooked and really nicely seasoned which went well with our other dishes including the chole frankie a wrap filled with spiced chickpeas
herbs
pickled vegetables and chutney and the sag paneer creamy spinach and cubes of home made cottage_cheese
i always order this dish everywhere we have an indian and this was one of the best i have had
we accompanied our dishes with pilau_rice
peshwari nan and our own byob bottles of beer_and_wine
by the end of the meal we were absolutely stuffed and very happy
the staff were really friendly and just left us to chat we ended_up staying almost an_hour after our meal without realising
i think tuk_tuk definitely scores highly for good food and laid back dining
i would highly_recommend it
controlling food spending but not managing to find a pizza house to obtain a chickeny pizza with bbq sauce base to scoff outdoors in the meadows on a sunny day we found ourselves at tuk_tuk
first time here and had to ask if they were open as we entered there was no one else in
after quizzing staff on this we found out the reason it was a sunny day and everyone would be in the meadows eating sausages or pizza
but they were booked heavily for later on
so we had choice of any table
and had the whole restaurant to ourselves
it defo wasn't a crowded house
too warm to drink beer
which they don't have anyway
only soft_drinks
we were offered bottles of chilled still water
but had also brought our own bottle
a short time later
some food arrived
so found out the washrooms were downstairs
knowing when i got back the remainder of food would be there
venturing into the basement was like there had previously been the perfectly cool wine cellar or old bank with plenty places to store that precious metal or paper currency
there was three of us at leven street's tuk_tuk
and they managed to satisfy our hunger pangs with lots of small variations of lamb and chickeny portions such as chook lollipops
tandoori style
butter chooks
bun chook kebabs with salad leafs and patina lamb
that were all complimented with a variety of spicy mint dips
in addition to rice and fries
to give them four possibly five_stars would be for creating an golden authentic styled establishment
not bowing to an inclusive mixture of other cuisines
seven dam fine flavours and cost for three happy excited campers ish
the place is bright and quite comfortable to plant your derri re
and has bollywood styled music to complete that indian feeling
but simply another great month old toddler that tollcross has to offered the good folks of edinburgh
makes me start to wonder is this now the gastronomic area of the city
see ya soon tuk_tuk
for another great afternoon
very accommodating staff in what is clearly a busy and popular establishment
rustled up two extra chairs for us no problem when they discovered the party's increased size hadn't been noted down from our secondary phonecall
service after we'd ordered was noticeably delayed but we put this down to the way the orders are scheduled in the kitchen
once the food started to arrive it was all on the table in quick succession
no complaints about any of the numerous dishes we ordered
i took my better half here for dinner last_night for his birthday
tuk_tuk had been on our radar for a while but we hadn't yet got around to visiting
as we were going to the cinema at fountainpark in the afternoon we decided to go here after
i totally forgot to take a photo of the food
sorry robyn
but it looked as good as it tasted
this super informal restaurant is home to a lovely chilled environment with nice staff and great food
what more could you ask for
also
it is byob with free corkage
so nip next_door to scotmid
grab a cheapy bottle_of_wine and settle in tuk_tuk for the evening
the menu contains a vast array of authentic indian street_food dishes
we order about dishes to share between us
including lamb
veg and chicken
accompanied_by a couple of delicious cheese naans and a roti
i can't remember the exact dishes we ordered but everything was so full_of_flavour and tasty
i would recommend going there and just ordering a variety_of_dishes that you have no_idea_what they are
my only criticism
and why i haven't given it stars
was that the food wasn't hot
temperature
it was all pretty luke warm
however
this is easily fixed and i'm sure we'll_be_back there again very soon
highly_recommend it
had to wait forever to get fed here
which didn't do much for my grumbly and unreliable tummy
the other problem for me is that most of the food is spicy
which is a bit of an issue when you've got a sensitive gut like me
too much info
despite asking the waitress for the least spicy options
what turned up still had me sweating
i liked the atmosphere of the restaurant and the idea of street_food
we were in a group of nine people so quite a few folk ordered the set menu
which was never ending and seemed pretty good value_for_money
again
quite long waits between servings so not an ideal option if the place is really busy
i opted for two veggie dishes and a naan_bread i think one of the dishes was a daal and the other was a potato and aubergine dish
they were both nice
but the spice was too much for me despite the waitress saying they weren't too hot
what can i say
i'm a wimp
the portion_sizes weren't spectacular as you'd_expect from a joint that does indian tapas
and that combo just about filled me up
it was all just
well
okay
i see quite a lot of folk like this place
but the combo of spice
long wait and tapas didn't really do it for me
maybe another visit needs to happen when less packed
or maybe it's just not for me
too much spicy spicy
great restaurant with funky decor and enough talking points to keep the most hard pressed for conversation diners occupied
staff were a little off
chap wasn't sure what each dish was
unable to answer questions we posed
another girl seemed to forget she'd handed us a menu for further orders
prompting us to get her attention
so a bit lax in that respect
but the fact we wanted to order more says a lot about the place
the food is damn tasty
set out in a tapas_style fare
tuk_tuk recommends a good or dishes per_person so as to get a wide feel for the menu
although they don't offer much in the way of seafood
the chicken
lamb and veggie dishes they produce are flavoursome and plentiful
i forget the names
and as the website is currently down am unable to blag it
but i would particularly recommend the chicken on the bone
cooked in lime and pickle
and the wee veggie parcels that
as the menu says
need to be tasted to be believed
and such good value
we must've nailed a good dishes
on top of that a roti and naans
to receive a bill to the tune of
the fact they are byob
and don't charge for corkage
is a massive help in this area
i will certainly be back
thursday curry club will want to know of this place
and i recommend you go too
now
really cool decor
great tasting food
check out the lucky mondays
rolled the dice and managed to get the meal for free
all the little plates of indian food
lamb on the bone with spinach
oh eh gee
that kind of overshadows all the dishes in my memory
as it was so delicious
but the channa daal
and other wee things were all delicious too
even the little pots of pickles with the popadoms were great
although they were small and not much pickle in each wee pot
there's also a photo booth where you can take stupid photos of yourself
or beautiful ones
if you're inclined
and they'll upload directly to their fb page
fun times
a bustly
busy
friendly
quick service restaurant
byob
delicious food
great fun
i would certainly go back
hmmmm i was a little disappoint ed with tuk_tuk truth be told
after hearing and reading lots of great thinks i was really underwhelmed
the service was a bith all over the place
took times of asking to get some water
the food portions for what you pay are reasonable
the cooking of the food itself i had a slight issue with
the seasoning was either over bearing or non existent depending_on the dish
the naan was very light and tasty but perhaps small for the price as were the rice portions
i can see why it has and will do well but not really my kind o thing
f
the last time i visited tuk_tuk
i was really impressed
the food was fresh and tasty
and the concept of tapas_style indian food was a novel concept for me
the place was buzzing and it felt_like i'd been temporarily transported from the bitter cold of edinburgh to a bollywood film set in mumbai
so i was quite excited to return for a second visit
alas
i was a bit disappointed
on my second trip
we made the mistake of not booking beforehand and so had to wait for a while
mins
before a table was free
we were asked to take a seat in a little room off the main restaurant
where there was another couple waiting
unfortunately
more people were invited into the room and it became a bit claustrophobic
however we were offered water and menus whilst we waited
we were shown to our table
one of the canteen style long benches
and then it was as if we were forgotten about
no one came to take our order
and it was only after i signalled to one of the waiters that we were given attention
i got the impression that there were a few senior staff who were stressed at having to manage the less experienced staff
there seemed to be a lot of staff running around
which does on one hand add to the street_food experience the restaurant is trying to offer
but came across as being a bit disorganised
tuk_tuk operates on the basis of first cooked
first served
so our dishes trickled out over the course of ten_minutes
unfortunately
they forgot about the mango_lassi i ordered and i only received this nearer the end of the meal
we also had to remind staff about our indian 'snack pot' that never arrived
the food itself
though
is great
the butter_chicken i ordered trumped any prior tikka massala i've tried and the chicken
basically chicken nuggets in a sweet sauce
was pretty tasty
my selection of vegetable_pakoras were pretty good too
the mango_lassi was worth_the_wait
my_only_complaint food wise was that the rice portions are a bit conservative
or maybe that's just compared to the load of rice normally served in takeaways
overall
we were each for around dishes
rice and a naan
and those indian snacks
staff were generally friendly but flustered
still
i'll probably go again
if only for another dose of that butter_chicken
lovely indian style tapas restaurant
my boyfriend and i went to tuk_tuk because we didn't just want one or two indian dishes
we wanted to eat from several
that's exactly what we got
busy
buzzing atmosphere was great in this byob spot
a few pointers
must get
butter_chicken
steer clear
saag_paneer never has paneer been so salty and saag just like wilted spinach
byob
there is an off license just a few doors down on the side street
basic beer and very basic wine selection
tapas small plates
all of the selections are pretty small
we had the following and were full
mumbai burgers
one burger
samosas
chutney
pappadom
x
kurkure
sag paneer
again
skip it
raste ke biryani
butter_chicken
peshwari_naan
garlic_naan
great concept
smart execution
slight yuppie smugness
they advertise authentic indian fast_food and have a very simple menu
i ordered the chicken curry
mild
which had a lot of flavor and even a little bite
i ordered the combo to go which comes with rice and naan but they forgot to include the naan in my order
the dish was mostly rice with very little gravy but did have some large chicken pieces in it
for
with tax i didn't feel it as that great of a value
even if i had received the naan
the place just opened and you can tell they are still working out the kinks
maybe i'll try it again in a few months to see if things have improved but until then i'll stick to what i know
excited i remembered that this place opened soon
i stopped in for indian 'fast food'
i ordered chole with rice portion
naan
the gentleman who took my order forgot to give me my change and after i told_him
he gave me my dollar back in dimes
i waited approx
minutes for my 'fast food'
the chole was ok
the rice was rice and the naan was great
like the first reviewer
i didn't think the value was that great
i'm no pig but even i could've had more
when i go back i'll have to get the big plate
full serving of rice whole piece_of_naan
but then we're talking
a bit much for fast_food
i will go back
though
they just opened and i don't want a food option like this to go away without a chance
i was surprised to see this place
the idea of indian fast_food had not occurred to me and it was really good
good food
great service
mango mastani rocks
i am giving this place the extra star for the service
they are a mom_and_pop place and you can see they are trying really hard to please which is quite endearing
however
efficiency of service is some time away as they do have some kinks there
as it relates to the food
the taste is average
by no means bad
but nothing stellar yet
i have been here twice and each time thought the food was just ok
i had also thought they serve indo_chinese which would have been a huge plus for me but it hasnt been on the menu everytime i have gone
they are still in start up mode so need to be given a chance
i may go back in months to check up on that
this place has good stuff
have tried the chicken_biryani and vada pav
both were good especially the vada pav
the lassi was a let down for me and my friends too
the other stuff that my friends liked were the kababs and some of the curries
they were disappointed by the mango mastani and bhel
it looks like a family_run restaurant and the day we went the service wasn't up to the mark as some of the employees had not reported to work
the owner apologized for it as we were leaving
hence haven't reduced a star
it would be better to give them a call and order before going to avoid waiting time
look for the
t
and the chili sign on the corner of the building
simple
super casual presentation of your indian favorites
as part of my ongoing quest to understand and sample the cuisine of india about which i know little
i ventured to tadka sizzles on tuesday for lunch since nearby bawarchi is closed on tuesdays
good spicyness in chicken_biryani
good rice body
not sticky or too wet
cooked to order may take minutes
and we were the only table
be warned
mango_lassi too yogurt ey
i need to make this more often at home
garlic_naan doughey and bland
signage advertised a lunch buffet
but the bar has been mothballed
barely usable ikea
matchstick
plastic furniture barely serves
i don't care i'm here for the food
styro
plastic and paper rule the fray
it doesn't stop me from enjoying this place
but come on
i'm starting an eco violator list
i picked_up some indian food from here
we had the lamb_biryani and a couple of the curries
the biryani was good but not as spicy as i had requested
the curries
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken curry
etc
were okay
i was really craving some good indian food for take out
with my favourite place being about a twenty minutes drive from me
i decided to find something a little closer
i settled on tadka sizzles after looking at the menu options
i called them to try and place my order
no answer
went straight to voice mail
i waited a few minutes and decided to try again
again
it went to voicemail
they have an option of ordering online
so i try that and it takes me to a broken link as their_website is currently under maintenance
i believe it's very poor business etiquette to not answer your business phone
twice
in a row
bad food i never had before but food is not having good quailty but the nan is to salty that i had last_night i will call to health deportment to come thear
if i could go to the buffet every week
i would
it's so inexpensive for all_you_can_eat
it was an all around great experience
i heard of this place by word of mouth
and figured that a buffet full of foods i'd never tried before would be so amazing
i was very pleased
we got rounds of food plus dessert
there isn't much of a dessert selection
but i preferred to fill up on all of their other food anyways
i had dinner here yesterday while passing through cambridge and i was pleasantly_surprised
great variety of meat and veg dishes
great nan
and a dedicated fruit station
wonderful value
i am still full today
the atmosphere isn't anything to write_home_about but who cares when the food is this good and this affordable
incredible service and friendly_staff
this place is a gem
incredibly good value for your money
you can't_go_wrong
omg yummy
my husband and i love indian food but have been hard pressed to find a good one in our area
or search is over
fusion has a wonderful selection of curries and beautiful fresh naan
the tandoori_chicken is amazing
inexpensive too
almost half the price of comparable indian buffet
truly amazing
excellent value
very good food and seriously excellent service
last time we went there was no veggie_korma on the buffet
our favourite dish
our waiter immediately went to the kitchen and had the chef prepare a small bowl of veggie_korma especially for us at no additional charge
now that is service
we have always found the food hot and delicious
at
for the dinner buffet
it is a real bargain
in addition to a great many entrees including vegetarian_options
there is a salad_bar that includes fruit
and kheer
indian rice_pudding
other desserts and ice_cream
a take out container from the buffet is
the afghan style bar b q chicken is particularly nice
and of course there is also the tandoori_chicken as well as a mint chicken
the curries range from mild to medium to hot
and there is a large selection of vegetable dishes
the roasted veggies are delicious
all in all who can say more
this is the best indian food we've had in years and we try to return at least once a month
we live more than an hour's drive away or we would be going much more often
newly opened on st mary's street
vinyasa is a very smart indian curry_house
their lunchtime menu
with
and
options
is excellent value
everything about the first is extremely good
from the decor to the service to the food on offer
we'd recommend a visit
next time the curry mood takes you
overall
we said
vinyasa was extremely impressive
we have a really good range of indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
and this fits in nicely towards the top end of that happy band
i strongly urge you to pay it a visit
at your earliest convenience
rather excitingly
they do takeaway
also
so if you can't make it along to the restaurant
just lift the phone
or order online
to sample their delights
the good people of vinyasa looked after us very well and couldn't have been more attentive
menu suggestions were well judged and the food was excellent
they're relatively new
but have created a lovely family_run restaurant in the heart of edinburgh's old town
i had lamb
which i often do with indian food
and it was lovely tender and full_of_flavour
my wife and i ate here while on our honeymoon
and we loved it
the waitstaff was exceedingly friendly_and_helpful and the food was terrific
my wife has a serious nut allergy that extends to chickpeas and lentils
which make indian food difficult
but the manager at vinyasa went out of his way to help us find some dishes that were completely safe and delicious
if_you_are_looking for great indian food
in a well run restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere
i highly_recommend vinyasa
the boyfriend and i were in need of dinner while on the southside of town the other week
since we hadn't had a curry in ages
vinyasa came to mind as i'd read a few reviews and thought it was about time to give it a try
the restaurant is located on st mary's street
so in a good location for tourists especially those just across the road in the travelodge
but it's clear that this place isn't just trying to attract the out of towners as the interior is very chic
with friendly waiting staff
and a good variation of curries on the menu
also the prices_are_pretty much the same as most other curry restaurants_in_town
so clearly not been hiked up for the tourist trade
we were seated as soon as we arrived as the restaurant wasn't too busy
but became busier as we ate our dinner
the menu has good variation
but not the overwhelming amount of options that some other restaurants may have
we opted to skip a starter and share some poppadums with a pickle tray instead
i ordered the chicken katmandu and the boyfriend went with a chicken jalfrezi
our poppadums arrived quickly with the pickle tray and two cobra beers
i feel like it's pretty hard to not make a good poppadum
so hard to comment on these
but the pickle tray had nice spicy onions
a tasty mango_chutney
and my boyfriend confirmed that the lime pickle was also quite good
our main_dishes arrived fairly quickly
attributed to the restaurant not being too busy
and we soon had our chicken curries in front of us with pilau_rice and a basket of garlic_nan
now i like a bit of spice in my curry
but not so much that i can't taste the flavour of the dish
i felt that the spice in my katmandu was judged very well
as it was warming but i could also taste the coriander
cinamonn
and other spices in it
the pilau_rice made a good accompainment and the nan_bread was garlicy and soft so very good for dipping in the curry
my boyfriend seemed equally pleased with his jalfrezi
my only real grip with this place is that for two main_dishes
a rice
a nan
some popppadums
and two beers the bill was which seems a bit steep to me
the prices on the main_dishes seemed reasonable
about each
so it must have been the side dishes that added up so quickly
but the food was quite tasty and the service friendly so it's hard to really fault them
it's definitely good to know that this place open especially as it will come in handy when we're needing a good feed before a festival night out
we booked online and they provided us a discount which was a welcome surprise
the atmosphere was pleasant and modern and the food was great as well
on a saturday around pm they only had one other table
so reservations were not necessary
not sure if they are much busier for dinner but as a result the service was good and the food came out quickly
we had some delicious curries which were rich and flavorful and had just_the_right_amount_of heat
meat samosa
deep_fried savoury pastries with minced lamb served with
a special sauce and accompanied with salad
garlic_naan
bread stuffed with coriander and garlic cooked in our clay_oven
tikka massalam with chicken
kebabs cooked in a mild flavoured sauce with herbs and spices
bhuna with chicken
traditional medium strength dish cooked with onions
herbs
tomatoes
and a variety of spices
tarka dhal
lentils served with a touch of garlic
good northern quisine
tandoori ovens and pleasant interior
watch out for the olives in martina's as they have hot chillis
surprising in a casino to have such international choices
the staff is okay and service fair
the important thing is the food and it is good
omg
i wish we had found this restaurant the day we arrived in vegas
the buffet is under and the food on the buffet is extremly fresh
the chicken tandoori is so delicious
the basmati_rice is delicate and had authentic flavors
the naan
bread
was out_of_this_world
we also had a very fresh salads
and the lentil dish was exquisite
try the sweet_rice with fresh fruit
delicious
now you should see the decor of this restaurant
it's spacious and luxurious
like an island in the heart of the hotel rio
it's a greatly non smoking space
thank god for that
i have to add to my review the extremly welcoming
warm
attention ate
details oriented service
everyone in this restaurant is an absolute sweetheart
i will defently comeback
this is a gordon's hell kitchen experience
i came out of this place felt_like i was robbed
for over usd per head
we had less than average food
with no favors
and clueless service
they at least got the bill right
though
if you don't believe what i am about to say
just go there and see that the restaurant is empty for dinner
and
even better
go in and have dinner and experience it yourself
be sure to share
we made a reservation for dinner on a saturday of may
thinking the restaurant will be crowded because its vegas
we checked out the menu before hand
and saw that they have fairly expensive offering main_courses for
vegetarian_dishes for
so we had reasonable expectations of a decent meal
when we arrived at
pm
we see that the restaurant is basically empty
there's only one other table
i felt something was wrong
but then i thought may be it's too early for vegas and people are not coming in yet
i was wrong
i was debating the okra vs
veg
biryani
so i asked the waitress what kind of vegetables they have in the biryani
she said
peas
so
rice and peas for
what
is that even a meal
ok
so we ordered the paneer for appetizer
okra and lamb_curry as main_courses
and nan and rice
which is also rice and peas
but for
the paneer came
and i know we shouldn't have come
it was basically dry and have very little favor
it tasted more like paper than cheese
when the waitress came with our main_course
she blatantly commented that she has no idea who ordered which dish
there were only tables
well
you could have handled that by saying
lamb
obviously its her first day
though i have to admit she doesn't have many customers to practice her skills
the okra was extremely sour
i tried very hard to eat as much as i can as we don't have time for another meal due to a scheduled evening show
i think i ate may be of the okra
it was so sour and dry that i can't figure_out whether they are rotten for months or someone had washed their feet with the okra
then
i tried some of the lamb_curry from my wife's dish
the meat tasted more like goo
and the source is more like a puree than a curry
it's just the wrong thing
and
for usd you get a small bowl may be cm in diameter
not that we would want any more than what we got
the rice was below average
couldn't taste too much of it because of the sour okra
the nan was ok
and its the only thing they didn't mess up
in the middle of dinner
another waitress came by with beer and asked if we had ordered beer
we did not there are like three tables at that time
how can you possibly mess that up
getting the check was really slow too
but i don't care too much about that
the final bill tips was over
which is the most expensive meal we had in vegas until that point
and the worst we've had in many years
it's simply worse than some of the very average indian_cuisine you can find in california
we had a meal the next day at the eiffel tower restaurant which is reasonably worth it
finally
i have to say this place fits exactly into the definition of gordon ramsey's hell's kitchen highly over priced
clueless front of house
food lack of favor
and above all
no customers and hemorrhaging cash
if they don't get a major ramsey make over
these_guys are just going to continue to burn money and close up
don't go here
from some of the other reviews
they may have a decent lunch
but i am not going to try
just like its name nothing is special about this place
it's in a casino so its overpriced and low quality
there is no wow factor and the buffet is not the world's largest
i would stick to off the strip for indian
a fast_food indian gourmet with live entertainment and modern deco would have worked better
no signature dishes and the bar is small and hidden and nothing special
i would have made it into bhangara bar with fusion tapas
went here with a group of friends and the service wasn't great
food was ok
i don't think i will_be_coming_back here again
the server gave_us the wrong check and charged the wrong amount of money on the credit_card
didn't refill water
tea or coke
we went to the
am to pm
lunch buffet
we had been there twice before for dinner when it was gaylord and both experiences were quite similar
nice ambiance
good
but overpriced food
lousy service
so i was excited they were back
same owners
new name
and could do a major affordable chow down and not have to worry_about the service because it was a buffet
really
what could possibly go wrong
so there we are nobody to seat us so i poke my head into the dining_area and someone comes and ushers us to a table in a near empty room
i look around
wow design fallout
the gaylord to india bistro remodel is more of a demodel
what was once a rather upscale and attractively appointed space has been dehabbed with cheesy booths and a tacky over bright chandelier
oh well
moving on
the buffet consisted of
dal maharani
baingan pakoras
eggplant
aloo baingan
think it was potato and eggplant
palak_paneer
basmati_rice
tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken curry
and some expired salad
a little heavy on the chicken and eggplant
but i was still ok with that
until i discovered that every chicken dish was a contender for the food despair jackpot
the one commonality they all shared was their styrofoam taste and consistency
it was the worst rice i have ever had and we debated if it was old or undercooked
settling on the notion that it was probably both
everything else pretty much sucked as well
there are people starving in
fill in the blank
and they would probably choose hunger over that buffet
the only plus
our server kept us attentively stocked with the only palatable things we had
garlic_naan water
joined a few friends who enjoy this place
it was recently remodeled so had a fresh look
we sat towards the back where we could look out to the pool of the rio
service was quick and friendly
we ordered a variety of items
i enjoyed the tandoori items along with the naan
my friends had some vegetable and chicken curries that they raved_about
would love to try this place again on my next visit
worst experience i have ever had in a casino
my sister and i had read about this place in the weekly and were excited to go
my sister has a nut allergy and has had issues at other local indian_restaurants so i made sure to ask several times what had nuts and what did not
i was told nothing had nuts
as soon as she took the first bite she could tell something was wrong
i called our waitress over and asked again about nuts
i took them about minutes to figure_out what had nuts by which point i had already run to the gift shop for emergency benadryl
the server told her she could try something else to eat and that the only thing on the buffet with nuts was what she had eaten
she was clearly too sick to eat so i informed the staff that we would be leaving
at this point the staff brought me the bill for my buffet
despite the fact that my plate was still full
i will never again patronize this restaurant and plan to call a manager as well
very average indian food
their daal is good and the naan is delicious
it's absolutely fresh
crispy and is full of flavor
everything else on the menu was a miss for me
lacked flavors
the service is good and the place looks renovated and new
the deserts are served cold but if u request them they will be happy to heat up the gulab_jamun and halwa
if you are really craving_indian_food and want to give it a shot try their buffet
i will definitely not recommend_this_place for dinner
save ur money
the buffet is tax tip and all_you_can_eat
the lunch buffet is ok
the tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka_masala and naan are good
the rest of the buffet was either dying in the chafing dish or not very appetizing
the yogurt curry was sour
the saag was desiccated and the salad looked a bit on the dead side
but for
in vegas
having enough good dishes to fill you up is passable
i am an avid follower of northern indian food and i am quite comfortable knowing how indian food should taste
i have not found anywhere better on the west coast for indian food besides royal india bistro
their naan is preciously cooked along with the tandori_chicken
spices are accurate and not overdone
there is generous sampling of all meats in all dishes
i love the remodel in that the tables and booths are comfortable
the place is very clean
service is attentive
and i would take the chance to eat there at any time i could
i cannot recommend_this_place enough
the wooden elephants in the middle of a casino sure beckon your indulgence for indian food
me and a friend_of_mine from la
went there
the place is not for the someone looking for a cheap chinese buffet where you need a food taster on a retainer
to see you will survive the ordeal
almost all the chinese restaurants_in_vegas are filthy and dirty rat holes except for the panda express outlets
exposed on a daily basis
by chanel tv
they are swarming with cockroaches
i saw one was as big as king kong
sitting cross legged
on an easy chair
the meat is not brought at traditional butcher or reputable supply houses or suppliers
but from unknown sources and no one has any idea which animal it came from
then the illegal chinese workers live in the kitchen and bathe in the kitchen and they also double as cooks
dishwashers and cleaning staff and they are closed for cleaning one day a year
a disability and life insurance is a good thing before eating in there
the only word they speak is
enjoy
which sounds like an order to be complied
if not the fortune cookie will have even sterner message in broken english
in this restaurant
i prefer to order fish kabob
since they are more north_indian than south
the kabob is a dry item and the cooking process removes any kind of fish aroma
i suggested this to my friend who devoured this so much he came back with his family few months later and ate to the hearts content
the food is fresh and healthy and you have to know what to order
not to mention you are paying three times the price for the luxury of dining inside a casino and the overhead is three time higher_than a strip joint
the chicken pakora is another delicacy that is perfect as an appetizer when you are relaxing with a chilled red_wine
the place was called gaylord before and the decoration was awful and the newer remodeling is nothing to brag about
the eatery is too well lighted for my tastes and loses the romantic appeal that you seek when you are paying this kind of money but the fish kabob is just out_of_this_world
other dry items i like is the tandoori assortment with fish
chicken and shrimp of course the mango kulfi and pistachio kulfi that is delectable if served like an ice_cream not like a hard cake
i went in here with a friend for their_lunch_buffet
it's definitely got very good ambiance and location
everything's a bit fancier than the usual indian place
fancy ceilings
plush carpet
cute buffet setup
comfy booths
but the buffet fare was definitely lacking a bit of excitement
they only had a limited variety and i go to many indian_lunch_buffets
so i know the standard options
but this place didn't have paneer
or korma
however
they carried carrot pudding so that was something to point out
drier than usual but it was still pretty good
the servers were very nice but also very forgetful
maybe she was new but her attitude about everything was very pleasant
i wouldn't come here again but was glad to have tried out another indian_joint
what a great find at the rio hotel
not a fan of buffets
atmosphere was wonderful
didn't hear the slot machines
quite
elegant atmosphere
service was warm and friendly
genuine
food was more than adequate
friend and i could have split the meal sampler
couldn't finish all the wonderful dishes
they didn't all taste the same
great spices and fresh
next time in lv
a definite go again
visited royal india bistro an_hour ago with my girlfriend and wanted to give this restaurant a review straight away
our host rahul was really polite and helpful
the service too is impeccable
the chef cooked a dish for me that wasn't on the menu and it came out fantastic
ive visited a handful of indian_restaurants in vegas and this is the best so far
thank you for our wonderful meal
formerly known as gaylord
royal india bistro can be found in the exact same place as it was before inside the rio casino
with the same owner and almost the same menu
the interior of this place is now more sophisticated
plush and cozy with spacious booths lining around the walls of the restaurant
i remembered fondly from my past visits
as this was my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in las_vegas
the delicious and creamy
korma
entrees
be it chicken
lamb
or vegetable
korma is always amazing on top of fluffy basmati_rice
there is no words to describe the taste and the feeling of the first few spoonful of lamb_korma and rice
really
you just have to experience it
indian food just isn't the same after tasting this item because you'll want to come back
again and again
for more of this delicious and heavenly korma curry
i don't know if i can ever order anything else on the menu here i'm too spoiled by this item and i'll just want what i love
over and over again
sure
they have really great curry and chicken tandoori
creamy spinach
cauliflower and carrots
but addiction has its limit as my tummy is only limited in space
the items to get here
if you ever come here
is the korma
lamb
chicken or vegetable
creamy spinach and cauliflower
trust_me
you_will_not_be_disappointed
this has to be the best indian restaurant in las_vegas
that is all
i read other people's reviews on here and was kind of concerned
i wanted to eat here for years and never have until last_night
i decided to ignore the reviews because people have such different opinions and it was also recommended by one of the chef's at my school
i have eaten at many indian places and i must say that i was surprised the food was great
i have great service and the atmosphere was also great
as far as the prices
i can see them being a bit higher_than some other indian_restaurants but keep in mind
any restaurant in a casino will be more expensive
even mcdonald's in a casino will cost more for food than off the strip due to the high rent
i went in for dinner and i was very happy with what i ordered and i would totally try them again
for lunch is actually a good deal and i wasn't aware of that until i went in
i will probably go back later in the week to check out the lunch buffet but otherwise i really had no complaints
i recommend people try this out for themselves to judge
i am glad i did
eating here was a terrible experience
the food was okay
but the service was a nightmare
we only had people in our party
but they acted like we were an unwieldy large_group
they forgot some of our dishes and beverages
even after being reminded several times
the management was rude when we tried to address the problem
additionally
the plain rice is outrageously expensive and they tricked us into ordering far more than we needed
save yourself the headache and find somewhere_else to eat
this was an surprisingly excellent meal
the rio is not the nicest casino in las_vegas
but i will be back for this restaurant
not only is it clean and quiet
closed off from the casino
but the staff was helpful and the food was superb
they were very accommodating when we asked about vegan_options
it was a nice respite from the chaos of las_vegas
wow
stopped by for lunch on a fluke
very nice decor
excellent food
good buffet
best part is the place was not crowded
no one knows about it
it was closed for a while first time i've been in for years
just had dinner
service was great and staff was friendly
my hubby had the non vegetarian complete dinner and i had the chicken_tikka_masala
and it did_not_disappoint
i'm not against indian food
but given choices
i rarely put it on the top of my list
for some reason
when i checked out this place
i decided_to_give it a try
i thought it was good
not great
the atmosphere was elegant so i was concerned i was dressed too casually
but noticed other people were dressed like me
i enjoyed my meal
but like most india food
it not something that i crave for again
we recently went there for dinner
the ambiance is good
its inside rio casino
the food was pretty average
sarso da sag was good
naan was good
other stuff was average
honestly did not like samosas
fount it very greasy and stuffing was not great too
gajar halwa was tasty
over all very average food
but it was pricey though
you might wanna try buffet first
good luck
the food and ambiance
fantastic
i ordered my food spicy
and boy was it ever
on my return_visit i'll go mild
this place is super fancy indian with prices to match
but that being said the food was incredibly delicious and the service was great
we went in with the groupon and still paid and did not have anything but water to drink
i would recommend_this_place is you have an xtra for really good indian
try it out
this place has gr food
service and ambience
hearty vegetarian as well as meat dishes
pricey because of prime location but you get nice portions and a classy place
buffet is first rate too
try the okra marsala or any lamb dish
after a horribly disappointing week of dining we found this gem tucked_away inside the rio we arrived just in time for the lunch buffet it was the food highlight of our trip
everything was full of flavor and wonderfully prepared
the staff was amazingly friendly can't_wait_to_go_back our next trip_to_vegas
nice quiet spot in the rio
very affordable lunch buffet with sufficient selection
a great lunch option if_you_are_looking for an alternative to the hectic atmosphere
i've only had indian food a handful of times in my life but this place was good
i don't have anything bad to say about it
for appetizers the garlic_naan bread
bhaji onion ring type dish and the vegetable samsoa are all worth getting
for main_courses the chicken_tikka_masala shrimp_vindaloo were both very good too
i would have to try some other places before i could compare it but i definitely recommend trying this place for yourself
service food both solid
very bad experience at royal
indian food is one_of_my_favorites and i was very excited to find a semi upscale indian restaurant in a vegas casino
but what a disappointment
i think we might have made a mistake going for dinner though
in my experience
indian_restaurants are typically better for the lunch buffet
service i'm not really sure whether to complain_about service or not
we were not really ignored
but at the time we were the only ones in the restaurant so not that hard
i also felt_like the wait_staff was trying to push me to spend more money the whole time
they asked if i wanted an appetizer times
asked if i wanted a bottle_of_wine rather than a glass a couple times
asked if i wanted to add sides or extra bread and weren't clear if they would be extra charge
just slightly annoying
also my entree was pretty spicy and they kept letting my water go empty
again
we were the only ones there
food i ordered the goat masala
which was one of the or items under the menu section
specialties
when i see this in a restaurant i usually assume they mean these are their best dishes
the ones they are known for
the rice was pretty good
its pretty hard to mess up rice
the naan_bread was also pretty good
the sauce was a little spicier than i expected
but i liked it
and they did offer a milder version
the problem was the meat
i've never had goat before
but there has to be a better cut than what we were served
my dad got the same thing as me
it was some of the toughest meat i've ever had
and there were maybe or bites that were free of fat or gristle
the pieces all had a big bone in the middle and smaller bones throughout
i kept accidentally biting down on them and hurting my teeth
the masala also had no vegetables in it just meat and sauce which was disappointing
to me at least
the worst of it though was how i felt afterwards
i don't want to say that it made me sick
but i spent a considerable amount of time late that night and the next day on the toilet
and i wasn't hungry the whole next day
price the reason this place is getting the worst possible score
for two people
one glass_of_wine each and then water the rest of the time
entree with no appetizer
no desert it was
add a tip and you are getting close to
i am used to paying that kind of money to eat on the strip
but i expect a certain level of quality and service for that price
and it was not met here
bottom_line is that i am not going back and i would not recommend it to anyone
at least stay way from the goat
they had lots of selections so i really didn't have to try everything
i liked most of the dishes i tried
i came here due to a groupon deal and it was overall just not that great
the decor is very nice and elegant but not reflective of the quality of food
the stand out items were the chicken_wings and tikka masala
the naan_bread was too firm and just not fresh
the price to food quality ratio is not worth going
the venue is designated to cater to tourists and casino guests
this is hands_down the best masala sauce i've ever had
anywhere
period
the people are beautifully friendly and the number of vegan choices available is fantastic
i'll stop here every time i come thru town
i went to the royal india bistro for the lunch buffet today
lunch was very good and service was excellent
i was the first person here at about
but several tables were occupied before i left
the server asked me for my drink order
i got tap water which
she then said they had a buffet and i replied that was the reason i was there
she gestured for me to go ahead and start and she'd get my naan
the buffet is small by comparison to other indian_buffets in town
there are hot dishes
some salad
and achaar
it was a good enough choice and the good taste of the food made up for the limited selection
the naan was buttered generously and was a welcome addition to the meal
for my first trip
i got chicken_tikka_masala
malai_kofta
and some basmati_rice
the thing i noticed about all of their dishes was they all had a nice spicy flavor
it's not overpowering for people who like mild food but it had a definite tang and it was not just one dish but all of them
it was the first time i know that i had malai_kofta and it was really a treat
the last thing was the vegetable_pakora
this was a bit disappointing
i didn't read the full description because i know what it is
the only vegetable i could see taste was potato
it seemed more like it was a pakora made from bread stuffing and some potato
for the second plate
i had aloo matar
daal maharani
and curry chicken
the aloo matar and curry chicken were good
the daal was ok
the sign said spicy lentils but this was the only dish that was lacking in spice
there were some beans mixed in the daal
too
for dessert i got some rice_pudding and some carrot pudding
the rice_pudding was not labeled as kheer and it had a lot of liquid with less rice unlike kheer or rice puddings i've had before
the carrot pudding
on_the_other_hand
was very thick and unlike the carrot puddings i've had elsewhere
both puddings were very good i'm not criticizing them but merely pointing out the different preparation
i wish i had seen the achaar at the beginning of my meal
i didn't think it would be as tasty with dessert
service as i said was very good
when i went for my second plate
my dirty plate was removed and my_water_glass refilled
the server was very pleasant
the room is quite nice and it was very quiet
the price is just over including tax
for the limited selection
it's higher_than most places
also
you have to park and walk your way through the casino to get there and it's right in the middle
halfway between either garage
still
i won't hesitate to stop here and i think i'll try it for dinner some evening
ah mazing food
nice and spicy
by request
everything was perfect food
service
spot on
we will be back
it's worth a trip over to the rio even if you're staying somewhere_else
fabby was fabulous great service
our waitress
jazmin
was fabulous
she made some great suggestions after listening carefully to us about what we liked
we had the fire naan
lamb_rogan_josh
and the vegetable_korma
let's just say that we stuffed ourselves with fantastic tasting food
if you are wondering where this restaurant is
you will find it in the rio casino area
this is a great little south_indian restaurant just two doors up from wee boulangerie on clerk street
the nilgris and chettinadus
hot
are incredibly flavourful
the nans are not like nan's i've seen anywhere_else
much more interesting
spinach dal is great the spinach is lightly cooked rather than being wilted to death as in most places
and the dal a bright flavourful yellow
all in all the food just comes across as fresh and original
the portions are smaller than in many indian_restaurants
but so are the prices
which is great
you get to try more dishes without a larger bill
two of us ate for
but most would probably spend a bit more
it's a small place and decor lighting simple
and the staff are really friendly
it only opened st march
and has a off discount all this month
oh
and no alcohol license yet
so byob which is another advantage in my book
this is
hands_down
the best south_indian food i've had in edinburgh
since trying a dosa last year
then exploring some of the hotter dishes from the region
and choosing from the overabundance of indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
when i heard the cholas had opened also offering dosas
i made a booking as soon as i could
and what i found wasn't just dosas
but lidls
and lots of other puffy bread products
and curries made the proper way with chunks of spinach and simmered down lentils and still firm chickpeas
and each curry tasting entirely different to the last
even their drinks are homemade
the cholas special
a tonic water with lime and mint concoction
incredibly refreshing
then the lemon and ginger tea i ordered at the end being another home made beauty
the chai latte is also made in house
the fact that the cholas make everything themselves
and there isn't a twinings teabag label in sight
really made me happy
but the biggest happiness came from the food
so many indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
so many doing nice food that really is tasty
but here you'll fine coconut rice with mustard seeds
coconut flakes and almonds
or lemon_rice with kaffir leaves and curry leaves and peanuts
or a daal curry with whole chickpeas
or a chicken starter with a delicious dopiaza style onion sauce
the curries were hardly 'saucy' at all
as is often the case
big bowls of creamy
liquid sauce with chunks of meat
oh no
these were mainly the ingredients whether it was spinach and lentils
or chicken or chickpeas being the centre of the dish
with hardly any extra
redundant
filler 'sauce'
i didn't even try a dosa and i was already head over heels
the interior of the restaurant is quite bare and a bit personality less
it was a night when it was blowing a blizzard of snow
and it was cold
no internal heating
although there was a small portable one
but the staff were so friendly
and the food just divine
i do hope they go from strength to strength and word spreads
i'll be back
and soon
for the banana dosa dessert
and to try the
lunch deal
there's also off in the whole of march
after seeing jenny l's review
i knew i had to come along
i am a massive fan of south_indian_cuisine
so edinburgh's dining scene is very exciting for me
we came along
it was empty
this was probably because it's new and hasn't built up a reputation yet
the waiters were really friendly and the menu was very authentic
on offer are thalis
uttapams
idlis
dosas
various curries
and various other dishes you would find in kerala or tamil nadu
my boyfriend and i went for the classic masala_dosa
whereas our friend who is visiting from milan opted for the chicken masala_dosa
dosas are fantastic
as the batter is made of rice and lentil flour
meaning there is no gluten inside
yay
unless you choose the rava dosa which is made partly of cream of wheat
while waiting for our food
the waiter brought a plate of poppadoms
mango_chutney
lime pickle and a minty raita
these dips were slightly less authentic
but went down well
it was especially nice as it was an unexpected treat
we also got given a glass of a sweet sparkling mint drink
which was very refreshing
the food arrived
and it was very nice
the dosa
whilst good
was not the best i have had in edinburgh
that would be tanjore or kalpna
but it came close
improvements
they could have supplied a little more sambar
made the dosas more crispy
and the masala filling could have been much spicier
maybe aiming at british tastes
despite these little observations
it was very nice
and for a new restaurant they did a great job
i think that a few simple adjustments could be made to make this on a par with the best dosas in town
on the dessert menu
gulab_jamun
deep_fried sweet doughy things in a very sweet syrup
payasam
milky vermicelli pudding with cardamom
kulfi
the most delicious pudding ever
a condensed milk ice_cream that comes in either pistachio
badam
almond
or mango flavour
flavoured with spices like cardamom
saffron
a few standard ice_cream options
and a regional dessert which i don't remember_the_name of which is made of rice and black lentils
i think it was a type of halwa
i'd love to come back to try the thalis
some of the other typical dishes
and chat with the lovely staff
i love supporting new south_indian restaurants
as so few people know what an amazing cuisine it is
there's more to indian food than curry
the cholas has only been open for days or so and last_night was my second visit
the food is is lovingly
beautifully prepared and served
it's all authentically southern_indian as my friend who has travelled there confirmed
without a doubt the best indian food i have experienced
as a previous reviewer mentioned the portions are smaller than you may find elsewhere and also slightly cheaper so it does mean you can try different things
on both visits my fellow diners and i haven't bothered with a starter course
instead we ordered lots of things to come at the same time so that we can share and try everything
there were so many interesting flavours to discover
they have some tasty teas and drinks too
i can't remember the indian names of the foods that we had last_night from the top of my head
however we did have a seafood curry
a vegetarian curry
a bread thing that was utterly delicious
coconut rice
which i think i could just eat on its own
tamarind rice and a dosa
which is a kind of indian crepe
the decor is quite basic
it could put you off at first
but i can assure you without a doubt that it will no longer matter when when the food arrives to the table the world is a brighter happier place
perfect for these chilly times in the burgh
i think the gracious and friendly waiter adds much to the cholas
he was exceptionally welcoming
but not overly so at all
i could tell that if we had hadn't been so interested to know about the food
south_india and the new venture he would have been just as kind and efficient
he is clearly just as passionate about bringing this authentic cuisine to edinburgh as the chef
i hope they never compromise on the quality of their food
i hope it never streams out of the kitchen at warp speed in the form of lumps of meat floating in bland sauce
i should also mention they don't have an alcohol licence however you can bring_your_own alcohol
i've been twice now
but would happily have anything i have tried so far again
although there is still so much more on the menu i would like to try
this is the longest review i have ever written
in case it's not obvious i really hope these_guys do well
with so much passion for the food they make they absolutely deserve success
plus my standards for good indian_cuisine has been raised to a level where if they leave i believe i would have to go to southern india to experience it again
off during march too
had an amazing masala_dosa in this small restaurant
it is clean and elegant
the staff are generous and polite
they've got a good selection of food and puddings in their menu
and the manager is very keen on chatting and answering any question one might have regarding the food
the prices_are_very_reasonable and i couldn't find any fault in this experience
i have been times in weeks
that's how much i really like the cholas
as i said in my previous review
it's hands_down the best south_indian food i've had in edinburgh
if you think you know 'indian food' this is very different to the 'british indian' made up of heavy naans
chicken_tikka massala and vindaloo
there are sauce based curries
but also lentil and rice crepe like pancakes called dosas
delicious small but buttery breads called paratha
desserts like paniyaram and gulab_jamun
and of course
mango_lassis
a thick
not too sweet mango milkshake
since i've been so often
i can now recommend my favourites
having tried many things on the menu
vegetarian curry mains
brinjal curry
aubergine simmered in tomato
quite sweet but also spicy
channa massala
chickpea_curry
so flavourful
dhal spinach
lentils simmered to a sauce with lots of spinach
creamy
but without dairy
and a bit milder
meat curry mains
chicken chetinadu
mostly sauce based
no veggies in the sauce
but sweet and spicy
it is spiced with pepper not chilli
so isn't too spicy
lamb nilgiri
green in colour
flavoured with mint
but not overpoweringly so
the lamb is so tender
meat mains
not curry
lamb masala_dosa
a large
thin crepe made of rice and lentil flour
fried in ghee and stuffed with lamb and potatoes and spices
it's gluten_free and really filling
it comes with three types of chutney
one being coconut
and a small serving of sambar
lentil curry_sauce
sides
paratha
non wheat bread
so gluten_free i think
made with corn
that is round
flaky and absolutely_delicious dipped in anything
coconut rice
all the rices come with spices
nuts etc
in them
the coconut rice is by far the best
no plain boiled rice here
desserts
gulab jalum
a very sweet
sticky
not healthy small donut type ball deep_fried then soaked in sugar syrup
decadent
paniyaram
less sweet than galub jalum
a white small spongey ball with some sultanas in it
and spices
a bit lighter too
teas
lemon and ginger tea
even this is home made
no twinings tea bag here
i know i'm giving brief descriptions of each
but basically everything is home made and with the best spices
every_single curry and dish i've had here tastes entirely different
no generic
red
creamy sauces with chunks of meat
instead
you'll find star anise mixed up amongst the vegetables in your kurma
and mustard seeds in the rice
like i said
even the drinks are home made
i'd also highly_recommend their special lime drink
very refreshing
and you can see the put a great amount of love into the food
the portions are a bit smaller but the prices are lower
which you means you can order more things to try and still leave very full but without overspending
i can see myself returning here many times more
a lot
they know me by name now
and are always very welcoming and 'service with a smile' is done so with the most genuine of manners
i'm_so_glad the cholas opened
and long may it last
we ate at this new south_indian place based_on other reviews_on_yelp
and then ate there again because it was so delicious
we don't get a lot of south_indian cooking in new england so we just asked our server to bring us a good meal
half vegetarian half not
everything was fantastic
and he was great about encouraging us to eat things we'd never had before
giving us the choice of having it
british hot
or
indian hot
if you go
order a double order of the chili fried idli
you won't be sorry
limited beer_and_wine menu
but the cholas special mint drink was a great alternative
i had heard amazing things about the cholas and when myself and a friend were looking for somewhere to go we passed this place and i thought why not
it was empty apart from one other table
the waiter was very friendly and polite but was hard to hear as he talked quite low
i went for the chicken masala_dosa as i wanted to try something different and had heard so much about dosas
although the place was empty it seemed to take a long time for the food to come out which i didn't necessarily mind but my friend had to catch the last bus home
i also found it a bit cold in the restaurant
while we were waiting we were given free poppadoms and then onion_bhaji which was unexpected and very nice
the dosa was great and i'm glad i tried it out
i had a chai_tea at the end which wasn't very flavoursome
i like mine to have a bit more punch to it
i was a little disappointed by the overall experience when i had heard so much good things about this place so i'll definitely have to go back again to hopefully change my opinion
the food was really excellent
it's nice to try some of the more unknown indian options
but something for everyone if you prefer the more tried and tested tikka masala
the staff were very nice and explained everything we were eating and answered all our questions without being too in your face
perhaps the list of starters was a bit too long as it was hard to choose from so many options
i'll be back again as there's loads i want to try
this is the best indian food i have had anywhere
and from any region of india
bar none
the food is fresh
delicious and full of great flavours and colours
everything is prepared fresh to order
the menu selection is very varied with lots of great choices
the staff are wonderful
very friendly
courteous and eager to create a great dining_experience for you
the restaurant itself is nicely designed and set
and is very clean
have been there twice already in a month's time
they have a great lunch and dinner menu
offer free delivery and catering
also
you_will_not_be_disappointed
and will visit often
i expect
enjoy
popped in on the strength of the reviews here and had been trying to get here for some time
but due to one thing or another we never quite made it
by the time we all had a free evening to check it out we were really looking_forward to the meal
positive side first i went mainly for the dosa as for whatever reason there doesnt seem to be many places to grab a dosa in edinburgh and i wasnt disappointed
i opted for the masala_dosa which was just as i remember
standard set of condiments and nicely spiced
a nice_touch was the waiter informed us that they would refill the dips free of change as much as we needed
before the food we were given poppadoms and dips
the dips were great in particularly the mixed pickle
unfortunately the other side of the experience was that the curries we ordered really werent good
they were a veg chettinadu
chicken chettinadu and a veg biryani
all of them were riddled full of the cooking spices that are normally removed before serving
every mouth seemed to present some sort of raw spice from a full star anise to a the bark stuff i cannot remember_the_name of
this really wasnt pleasant
by the end of the meal we had excavated piles of inedible nonsense from our food
the curries them selves were okay i tried a bit of the chettinadu and all i could taste was cinamon and star anise with a bit of heat on the back end
mmm
i would go back for the dosa i guess
but that was it really
the service was good
the food as a whole wasnt and the stars are for the service and the dosa alone eveything else was a thumbs down from me
i had been wanting_to_try the cholas for a while based_on several recommendations over yelp
and last friday_evening i managed to get there along with other well tuned curry fans
entering the restaurant
we were faced with fairly standard decor
woodchip walls
simple lighting and for some reason
adhesive gift bows stuck to the walls
we were sat at a table for four
which because it was an extendable table meant that i rather uncomfortably sat with my leg curled around the table leg for the duration
the menu offers a nice variety of different dishes
and typical of indian_cuisine
veggies are very well catered for
between the of us
we ordered a veggie and a chicken chettinadu
a veggie biryani
all of which had the same sauce
and a dosa though sadly just one of these dishes lived up to any sort of expectation
the biggest problem with the cholas is that they fail to remove any of the inedible pods and leaves before serving
this is either because they are rushing to get the food out to the punters
or this is a conscious decision to make the sauces differ from a jar sharwoods sauce
this might be harsh
but the chettinadu sauce was identical to a pre made vindaloo sauce
in either case
the last thing you want when dining in a restaurant is to be gouging pieces of bark out of your mouth
by the end of the meal we each had piles of bits and pieces sitting on our side plates
perhaps a spittoon would have been a more appropriate piece of crockery to have on the table
negativity aside
the dosa was apparently
great
and the service was very friendly
the accompaniments to the poppadoms and the naan breads were above_average and their lime pickle was darned tasty
i'm glad i went to try the cholas for myself
and i'm hoping they were just having an off night on friday
but i don't think i will be heading back there any time soon
the cholas really sums up why i love yelp
it's the kind of place you spend years looking for
but probably wouldn't give a second thought to if you just walked past it on the street
step inside and it doesn't look a whole lot more promising a small
narrow restaurant
with beige walls and splashes of dark wood straight out of the ' s
it's really at this point
however
that the evidence of your eyes becomes much less important than that of your nose
aromatic south_indian spices
bubbling ghee
grilling meat and bread all jostle for your attention
if that's not enough to convince you to grab a seat
and if it's not
i really don't think we'll get on
the friendly
welcoming staff certainly will be
so
to the food
it's basically everything i've been looking for in an indian restaurant since i moved to edinburgh interesting
authentic dishes with varied
distinctive flavours and textures
properly seasoned and sensible portion_sizes
it's such a novelty to have dishes that aren't drowning in fatty unctuous sauces
generic spice blends and two dimensional chilli heat
the meat options are great
but it was really the vegetable dishes that stood_out for me
don't think i've ever had such an exceptional brinjal curry anywhere the aubergine actually tastes of aubergine
and is balanced perfectly by the delicate smokiness of the fresh curry leaves in the thick
sticky sauce
the dals are also brilliant
perfectly seasoned and spiced
with real texture and an earthy lentil flavour that really complements the other dishes
this is definitely my new favourite indian restaurant in edinburgh
it more than stands up to mother_india cafe my current spicy hangout of choice and even some of glasgow's best
so
yeah
recommended
the cholas
on south clerk street
is a place which has built up a devoted following in the few months since it opened and hosted the yelp team recently when i was away
the cholas' menu of south_indian dishes is extraordinary in its diversity
encompassing a huge range of cooking styles
ingredients and flavours
we enlisted the help of our waiter
to ensure that across our party we got a good variety_of_dishes to try
we decided to try the new paneer dhosa that isn't on the menu
it's a thin rice and lentil flour pancake with paneer cheese and fried onions that was very tasty
especially with the cocnut dip
chutneys and sauces
mh opted for the king prawns
then the lamb nilgiri
i ordered the chilli idli
then the fish_curry
the service was really friendly and the waiter very patiently explained what dishes would compliment our choices
m's king prawns were good and the idli was a spicy but really tasty but the fish_curry wasn't as flavourful as i would have hoped
the lamb however was lovely
so overall
the cholas was a very interesting experience
as the range of dishes on offer was impressive though i think we need to go again to try more things
especially as the restaurant is such a new enterprise i think the food will only get better
cholas serves amazing south_indian food
i'm not usually into indian food
but i was curious to try out this fairly new place after reading all the rave reviews
well
i wasn't disappointed at all
for starters i shared a dosa which came with three different chutneys
coconut
mint and tomato
the dosa was light
crisp and airy perfect
for main_dish i chose the lamb nilgiri with coconut rice
the flavours of this dish were just amazing
i cannot fault it it any way the only minor issue is that the lamb could have perhaps been a bit softer
but nevertheless i enjoyed it very much
i've got a mission now
i will have to come back and work my way through the menu it's just too delicious not to
i need to explain i was invited to go here as a birthday present
the duchess of the cholas tanja r was very convincing that i
as non enthousiast of indian food
would find this place as wonderful as she does
especially the dosas
anita a
called ahead to advise we were bringing our own dessert which was no problem
star
so in a group of we arrived at around
you see where this is going as i mention an arrival time
we were seated and i took a good look around the place
an elongated place with dark wooden tables on either side and a dispensing bar order section in the back on the way to the kitchen
i was hoping to elaborate on the atmosphere
but there was none
no decoration of note ok i lied
they used those shiny metallic wrapping stars you use on presents
on the wall
about of them evenly spaced over the place
the table decoration was nicely done with the actual only bright colour in the place
tanja r was warmly greeted_by the owner manager and was assured tonight was going to be a blast
that was a serious overstatement
i will not go in to many details but i mentioned the time of arrival and after ordering
he made a really clear show of repeating every ordered dish back to us
and awaiting our starters
we eventually got our starters at
wtaf
we became a bit worried about what and why it took so long
as they kept forgetting water we asked for twice
and my beer had to be reordered too
evident ally they were busy
however a table of that arrived about half hour after us got starters at the same time as us
i was again assured by menno v
tanja r
and anita a
that they had just recently opened and this is just unusual however that statement was on shaky ground
when the main_courses arrived
fairly swift after the starters
they managed to not serve mine
i got the rice
but no main
i shared the meal of others
we did ask where my meal was an he said he was going to check and reorder
however we were thus far that all of the other diners already finished and my rice was also about gone we cancelled my main meal
my birthday meal
not impressed
i had to eat from other plates to have a meal on my birthday
seriously
fair does to the taste though as all the food we did have was very flavourful
star
but it would have been nice to actually have my own meal
the tiramisu that anita made was very nice
little in apologies was supplied and they actually put the missing dish on the bill
at this point i started doubting the previous rating for cholas of my fellow diners who even at this point still half heartily defended the place
another disappointment was the toilet
beside not being very clean
i was just washing my hands and hand dryer didn't work
yes menno v
i did try to use the on switch
no paper towels
so i resorted to toilet paper
and the holder fell off the wall and onto the floor
i tried placing it back
didn't fit
afterwards when going again it was back in place and at the first tuck it fell off again
so they kept telling that this place just opened and they are usually not busy
well when star reviews are set you better get used to being busy
and now with the fringe in town people will look for good places to eat and look at that all important star_rating
even tanja r anita a had to advise the owner manager that they will have to avoid going here during the fringe as they are not looking to repeat this experience
if they don't get their act together
my review may not be the only one of its kind
but many more will follow
i was so disappointed that due to all this waiting to get food the whole evening was about over when we finished_eating and we were too tired
too full
and miffed
to do anything else well i did anyway
so home wards it was
it should've been so nice and i was pleased to have my good friends with me
but any other place would've likely been a better experience
when you regularly see smiling indian faces as regulars the food has to be up to mums standard
also they support marie curie cancer care a worthy cause on presentation of a voucher
i magine when its busy you have to wait longer to be served
however be patient its good food and good value
try and taste the difference
oh how the mighty can fall
the cholas was the newest opening in edinburgh i was most excited about
it opened in march and i went about times in weeks
as my first review of it attests
i got chatting to the waiter
and learned that the chef was from south_india and had been a south_indian chef for a number of years
the food that was presented over the last months at the cholas was beautiful
chana_masala chocked full of chickpeas
chicken curries so delicately and intricately spiced
paratha bread that was melt in the mouth delicious
dosas that were crispy
and filled with flavouful potato or lamb
but in the last months
the food quality has reduced quite a lot
and in such ways that i can point out what has changed
the chana_masala has about has many chickpeas as it used to
and is far more a 'sauce' with some floating chickpeas in it
before it used to be made up of almost purely stewed
soft chickpeas
the dosa once came
home delivery
with a lamb filling that had no flavour or spice
they must have forgotten to add any spices
but it was tasteless
the chicken curries taste like standard
uk indian
creamy
spicy curries but with no distinct flavour
the paratha is thicker
heavier
less buttery and fresh
and just not as great
the aubergine curry also has less aubergine in it
this used to be a restaurant that offered what many indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh couldn't
excellent indian food
authentically cooked and spiced
with beautiful ingredients
good portion_sizes with very unique dishes
the waiting time in the restaurant was lengthy
and the interior of the restaurant is also very 'lacking' and plain
but it was worth it for the delicious food
now
the restaurant is still lacking in decor
the waiting time is still very long
and the food quality has reduced so much that i don't want to spend minutes waiting for it and really don't know if i'll go back
i've ordered
both sit in and takeaway
times from them since i noticed the change in quality
each time hoping the last was a fluke
but no
it seems to be permanent
this is almost like a break up
i'm sorry cholas
you still serve totally 'a ok' south_indian food
but it certainly isn't any different or special to anything else served in edinburgh
and you used to have something that no one could imitate
such a shame
the dosa may be great
however the curries just lack due care and attention
a little cinnamon bark
cardamon pod or star anise might be ok
but not mounds of the stuff
while necessary for flavouring the food
for the most part this should be removed
the curry also had an odd sweetness to it
despite being a supposedly hot dish
some of the heat was there but i was just to distracted removing the inedible
the chicken was only ok
certainly not the best meat i have had in a curry either
all in all i can't recommend cholas
particularly when there are plenty of other better curry choices in the area
i have known them from their incubation days
humble start up
nice people and they make great food
i ordered biryani twice from them
one for a big birthday party
and it tasted so authentic both of the times
not so pricey and this could be very well one of the best biryanis in the valley
just make sure to mention about the spicy hotness level in the food when you order
wonderful and yummy biryani
we have had food catered from this group several times
recently we ordered veg and chicken_biryani
both were delicious
i placed an order days in advance for my boyfriends birthday party by calling their number
the guy on the phone was not prepared to take my order and instead of taking my order and information
the he asks me to send them my order via e mail
without much direction
i send an e mail with my order
i didn't check my e mail within a day and my order was cancelled
regardless of the fact
that i called them immediately the following morning at
am and repeatedly calling and emailing again hoping to get my order through
the guy finally calls by back at
informing me that he could not fulfill my order and that he had been away from his business phone and he had clearly lost number from before so he could not call me
needless
to say i had no food for my party
so after a couple weeks of me wanting a combination of wanting spice and buttery and salty things
all thanks to me being pregnant
my hubby finally won in his mission to get me to try indian_cuisine
seriously
it was more of an off handed suggestion that we trade in my chinese request for indian and my spice craving offspring overtook my brain and the voice that yelped
yes
sounded like something out of the exorcist
a short time later we found ourselves at bombay palace
a brand new indian restaurant my darling hubby had spied being built during our many trips to big lots
my obsession
it took us quite awhile to be seated
another customer picking_up catering goods actually flagged down the hostess who in turn seated us
they also obviously don't use their ac
which made life kind of interesting and had me rolling up my pant legs under the table a culinary experience first for me
my friend
who was joining us
and i inquired about foods that wouldn't burn our virgin
to indian
mouths off and the hostess waitress quickly sent the chef out who's a rather charming east indian man
he guided us straight and true and suggested i order the chicken_korma curry in mild
mild did not mean watered_down and americanizes
it meant not fire in your face
but enough of a kick to keep life interesting
oh
my
god
seriously
oh
my
god
i was born in the wrong neck of the woods
indian food is my new calling in life and i will never ever not trust my husband's culinary decisions ever again
this restaurant is incredible and i hope it stays forever
everyone needs to try bombay palace and share it with everyone they care about because sharing is caring and this food totally equals love
i would so give it stars if it wasn't for the slow start and lack of ac
seriously
i'm in love
the food was great
nice
little clean place
the menu lacks description
but i was able to ask the waiter about anything that sounded interesting
i will be back
amazing
spicy
if you want
authentic_indian_food
take the lack of descriptions in the menu as a sign of the restaurant's authenticity and your opportunity to learn what some dishes are without a cheat sheet
the server will describe what things are if you have questions or
if you are ordering takeout
you can gfg it
this is no longer southern spice
and the mediocrity of that other restaurant is no longer there
either
we've ordered takeout several times through grubhub and loved it
they honor requests of spiciness and make it just right
kormas
vindaloo
biryani
paneer or chicken_tika_masala
basmati_rice and samosas have all been piping_hot
fresh
served with love and absolutely_delicious
go go go
forget any other restaurant that has ever been in that location
amazing food
they customize the spice_level to your liking
tried hyderabadi chicken dum_biryani and chicken chettinad
by_far_the_best_indian food i've eaten in tempe
meh
service is attentive and eager but not too competent
e
g
we ordered cabernet and got tepid chardonnay
food was so so
not as good as delhi palace
the spinach part of the palak_paneer was reminiscent of school lunch spinach
maybe canned
the amount of sauce in the lamb and chicken dishes was disproportionate to the meat there were only a few bites of meat to a good
cups of sauce
none of the three curries or the birjani was memorable
went to check out the lunch buffet
appears to be out of business
no hours posted on the sign outside
best
well shit
all good things must come to an end and i suppose favorite indian_restaurants are no exception
maharana
isnt entirely bad
good service
clean space food entirely worth stars
but absolutely make no mistake
this place is not as good as the place that was here
that rhymes with maharana
its very obvious they are cutting corners on ingredients where previous restaurant may not have
oddly enough we really noticed in the desserts
rice_pudding a little to cloyingly sweet
gulab oddly metallic flavored
what was offered on the rest of the buffet was good
but again just a little less richly flavored than our party had been accustomed to
i hate to say it
but we will be moving on from our regular stop here
i hear there are a fair amount of indian restaurants_in_madison
i
this place was really just okay
service was okay
could_have_been_better but it was decent
i was rather disappointed with the naan
it was super salty and i was pretty close to sending it back but i preserved and finished it
my eggplant_dish was good
and there was plenty of rice to go around
they deliver around madison
which is a plus
i drove to inchins on their very first day and without a doubt it was very crowded
i had to leave the place without any dinner because i have a month old son and he would not allow me to wait for a long time
no complains there
i came back on the upcoming wednesday and the place had mild traffic
the service was terrific and we were served our food quickly
service was very good and i commend the place for that
not too sure how efficiently they would function in extremely high traffic
moving on to the food
not too spicy as you get it in india
but i dont mind that part
generous portion_sizes
good menu choices
vegetarian and non vegetarian
prices
not on the modest side
for a starter is a little bit high for me
additional sauces on the side are a big plus and improve the taste of the food
overall
i would recommend_this_place_to_anyone who would like to try out something new for a change
but if you expect spicy indianized chinese
this is not for you
edit
visited this location again
the staff was pleasant as usual
but the food is downright boring
the chineese bhel was probably fried in used oil and the chicken manchurian lacked any flavor
not going back to this place
boring
yawn
excellent food
we had been eagerly looking_forward to its opening as we love their atlanta branch
food was spicy and very close to the indian food we get back home
the kids loved the gobi_manchurian appetizer
the chili_chicken was fabulous and so was the burnt garlic fried_rice
the hot and sour soup was meh
the quantities were perfect
so happy to have an indian chinese place in scottsdale
so here's the deal with inchin bamboo garden the service on weekends is meh
partly because of the indian mentality of not turning a guest
in this case a customer
away
american restaurants are very upfront about waiting time and solid about reservations
but inchin on weekends
not so much
i'm not sure if it is because they are brand new and trying to build a customer base or if it's a management problem
either way
they should fix it soon because their food
omg
i think the indo_chinese food at inchin might even be better than some that i have had in india
it was so good that we didn't even mind the can be better service
it was worth every minute of our wait
we got veg manchurian
chili_chicken
hakka noodles and burnt garlic fried_rice
and loved it
in fact
we went this past friday and i'm already craving their food
we might go back this weekend
the place is worth checking out
if you are not up for a wait on a weekend
go on a weekday
but do go
also
do let them know about the spice_levels
just in case
our food was spicy but we were okay with that
why
why
why do i always have
bizarre o
experiences at restaurants
i am beginning to think i am cursed
is it so hard that i receive a balance of good customer_service
good food and a nice_atmosphere
is it too much to ask
really
read my other reviews and you will understand what i am talking_about
dismal one and two star ratings
of otherwise highly rated restaurants
well
on to this story
i normally try to not frequent
chain
or
franchised
restaurants
i don't like them
when i go out and spend money
i want a chef preparing my food
not a cook
if i want a cook to prepare my food
i will cook it myself at home
i am a cook
not a chef
i visited inchin bamboo garden on with a group of co_workers celebrating a birthday lunch
the birthday person chose the place
it was noon and the place was completely empty when our party of arrived
we chatted a bit and then placed our order
we all ordered off the lunch menu which included soup
a choice of rice and the entr_e
one of my co_workers was worried about the spice_level of the black bean sauce in one of the vegetarian_dishes and asked if she could have the sauce on the side
about min after we had all placed our order
the waitress came back and said she could not get the sauce on the side
hmmmm
why
it was just sauce
so we asked to speak to the manager as we felt this was not an unreasonable request
the manager
begrudgingly
came over and said they could not serve her black bean sauce on the side because they are a franchise restaurant and they use prepared powdered mixes and it reconstitutes as they cook the dish
oh_yeah
that sounds yummy
not
oh
btw that was the last time we saw the manager
about minutes into our wait
still no soup
nothing
then some entr es start coming out
i got mine
and i said to the waitress
shouldn't the soup come first
she said
yeah
usually
usually
ok
whatever
out of the of us
got entrees and soup
the other had nothing not even the soup
one of my co_workers ordered the chicken curry and her teeny
tiny bowl was only a tad over half full
i will attach a picture
yes it was so pathetic i took a picture
the picture time stamp was
pm make note of this
my portion was small
but at least i got my full portion
i ordered the sliced lamb hot garlic
it was ok
the rice was terrible
i ordered the fried_rice
it was dry
cold and flavorless
it was like it had been made the day before and thrown onto my plate
the hot and sour soup was cold on top and smoking hot in the middle
it was not very good either
i wanted to eat
i was hungry
but as my other co_workers sat soupless and foodless i held off
so we waited
and waited and waited about another minutes
finally the waitress brought of soups but still no entrees
one
lone
co_worker still sat with nothing
we all had meetings and had to get back so we had no choice but to ignore etiquette and start eating
then magically
one more lunch was served from the kitchen which ended_up not being what she ordered
but she accepted it anyway
and then there were three
one co_worker still with no soup or entr_e
we asked the waitress what the heck was going on
the waitress then told us that all our food was ready at the same time
but of the entrees were delivered to other tables
what other tables
there wasn't anyone else there when we ordered
there was now one other table of people
but did they really have our food
what was the coincidence of them ordering the same items
finally
at
pm
the last entrees came out from the kitchen sadly one had to be in a
to go
bag because she had no time to eat because of her meeting and had to get back to work
the other two co_workers just ate fast
at the end of this horrible experience
they did comp the missing meals and after asking they took off my bill geez thanks
the waitress made mention that the manager sent her out to us to apologize and to let us know that servers quit that morning and they had to use kitchen staff to help run the food
well there were only tables of people total
how many servers do you need to wait on tables
there were other people i saw working there doing nothing
and what about the manager
where the heck was he
why wasn't he helping
never once did he come over to apologize
but instead sent the waitress out to do that for him
isn't that his job
all he did was hide in the kitchen
truly terrible experience
ironically
the girl who had to get the
to go
order and never got any soup
is from seattle and she says that she used to frequent the franchise located there and said that it was wonderful
hard to believe that is true with the comedy of errors at this place
this is a do not return dnr
food is really good
but the service is aweful
i don't understand what part of restaurant service they don't get
they have such good food and i hope they don't screw up with the service and drive away the customers forever
i may be one ov those if they continue with this type of ridiculous service
it is a truth universally acknowledged
that any foodie from india must be in want of good indo_chinese food
and oh i have waited for that in phoenix for the last years i have been here
i have finally been rewarded
we had a good dining_experience last friday when we went for dinner
the sweet corn chicken soup
drums of heaven and salt and pepper shrimp were all quite comparable to what you get back home
for entrees
we had the chicken manchurian
chilli chicken and chilli shrimp
unfortunately
all of the gravy
while tasty
tasted alike
would have probably given a
star due to this but am feeling generous
the burnt garlic fried_rice and hakka noodles was very good
they also have their sauces on the table so you can customize as you want
serving size is decent
service and decor is very nice
tip
please make reservations prior to going here
they either overbook on the reservations or are really busy
we walked in without a reservation and had to wait almost minutes to be seated
will return whenever the craving hits again
did not even get to a table
despite having called an_hour before and asked for a table for at
the female on the phone told me that they were not taking any more reservations but for us to come on in and they would seat us
upon arrival there was no greeting from any of the staff
i walked up to the person who seemed in charge and had to get his attention as he was more involved with another
yawning
employee
i won't go into any further details but i see the common thread about poor service in all the reviews
i concur
i think this is one and only indo_chinese restaurant in phoenix area
nice and clean place
food was really good
we went on a thu with reservation and was not crowded
try the manchurian chicken
tasty
indo_chinese cuisine is pretty popular in india especially in the south_india
i've been wondering why there are so few of them here in the us when the indian diaspora is increasingly south_india
if you are expecting the american chinese or real chinese cusine
you will be very disappointed
but if you know what indo_chinese tastes like
this place is pretty close to what it should be
went here with a big group and tried almost everything on the menu
loved their appetizers
and all their fired rices tasted similar
their spice_level is pretty mild and the sauces that they put on the table are very tasty
i am sure it's not the food you should be eating all the time being deep_fried and all but it's a great guilty pleasure if done once in a while
the service was good albeit a little slow
the restaurant get packed so
having a reservation definitely helps
uh oh
now bear with me for a second
i went in for lunch a_few_weeks_ago and stood at the front for about minutes before finally leaving
ok
it was probably
but when you're waiting it seems like twice the time
and either way was too long
strike one
the place still has intrigued me so i decided_to_give it a second chance
if only for some take out
so i walk in around pm
and grab a menu from the bartender
i decide to order the friend won ton and the
well
i asked her about the singapore shrimp
she had absolutely no_idea_what it was
i then asked her about the won tons
and she did ask me if i wanted vegetarian or chicken
so she knew the won ton
while she was very nice
not knowing a product on a menu isn't really acceptable in a restaurant like this
she fumbled around for a while until she could get someone to explain it
so at least she was trying
not her fault but is very indicative of the management
that needs to be fixed
strike two
anyway
i got the food home
and whoa
reversal
the wontons were perfect
chicken
and not what you'd_expect
very tasty and almost light they were excellent
and then i got to the shrimp
and it was also really good
it wasn't as spicy as i wanted
but it was plenty spicy enough i just like xxxxx hot
the texture was great
the shrimp were large and all in all it was enough food
i will go back
but if they continue to have service issues they will fail
i
my husband and i went for dinner at inchin last evening
we arrived at pm and the place was packed
we were seated at the bar until we got our table
we had a few daiquiris and margaritas nothing special there
for appetizer we had the fried chicken wantons
they were deep_fried
as hard as rocks
i could taste nothing
we also tried the mixed fried_rice
and scjezuan chicken
the rice was not too bad
it was un oily
which i appreciated
the chicken was good too
reminded_me_of the chinese fare i am used to from eastern india
all in all
the food was ok
the place is a little un managed though
there were folks who were party of
seated at a person table
thereby wasting two seats
those could have been pulled out to make a makeshift table
which would have reduced the wait times
ambience was great but food was very mediocre
the noodles tasted good
i didn't like the manchurian
food was very spicy
great food as always in every inchins location same spicy level and good amount for lunch serving
had crispy chili honey chicken with hot and sour soup and chicken fried_rice taste will be mouth till dinner
i will_never_go_back
i said i would give it another chance
which i shouldn't have
after my last review and i did that
more of the same
terrible service
took minutes to even be greeted to get my take out
then the person behind the bar said and i quote
yeah
it will likely be minutes before we can even start your order
this is too bad
but three strikes and you're out
yummy spicy food reminds of chinese_food in india
really good food and ambiance
service ok but can be better
great chinese_food in indian style
i and my friends were dying to eat indo_chinese food from a long time and we are glad to find this place
chicken schezwan and american chopseuy were amazing
would recommend to all indians
really need stars here
more like
this is not a chicago restaurant but for dumbed down scottsdale it is decent
at least there are some interesting choices and the food is pretty tasty
a bit heavy handed on the salt or soy i think
but some good flavors
i chose the hottest dished available
and they were still not very hot for me
but i could add some of the table sauces and that did it
my hsb likes blander dishes like the stir fried beef
the chicken and beef were good quality
not grisly like some places
our service was fine
we had a really pretty indian american girl who was on the ball
the place was full saturday when we came in at
then really got busier
most of the patrons were ethnic which isalways a good sign
but most appeared_to_be of indian heritageor that neighborhood
not asian
anyhow
we'll try it again
there is really slim pickings wth this type of food here
i have written this before
but will write it again that
in phoenix
an indian restaurant would not suffer on bad service
an indian restaurant will probably suffer on bad food only
i mean all indians loves the indo_chinese food
it is greasy
it is fried but still we love it
inchin has a great variety for vegetarians
no problems with food at all
it is yummy
the soups and appetizers are great
the entrees are great too
i mean nobody else is serving this stuff
so of course inchin has an edge over other indian_restaurants
the portions are big
so you would definitely pack some home for next day
we have been here times
one of which was the new year's eve
too many server girls moving around
we were taken to our seat as we had a reservation
the restaurant was not completely packed as yet
but this lady never returned to us with menus
the girls were just moving around in groups
just chatting away
not looking or going to customer's seats at all to ask them
whatever
i did not see any manager who would at least just tell them what was needed to be done
anyways we got our menus and ordered
the food took forever to come
overall service is not that great
but not absolutely pathetic
so i go for stars
five_stars coz there isn't anything higher_than that
excellent food
very professional service and perfect ambience
best place for indian chinese_food hands_down
we drive all the way from gilbert for this food
great job
love their veg coin manchurian and lat mai paneer
the soups and sauces are full of cornstarch and have a gooey consistency
would we ever go back
no
giving two stars only because the food was good
not great
but good
pros
good food
cons
horrible service
late food
took almost an hr to get the food
servers are not even bothered to ask once they take the orders
our server took wrong order and then had to replace the food
server didn't even know how to place the food on the table
slams the plates all the time
chewing gums
no etiquette at all
is it worth a second visit
only when i'm craving for a indo_chinese food
so freaking excited that we finally have an indian chineese fusion place around here
my wife and i love indo chineese
it's one of the fusions we look_forward to on all our trips to india
with these two countries neighboring each other it's not surprising the flavors are compatible and can cross pollinate so well
the only real question is why hasn't it picked_up more in the us
that said
inchin bamboo garden is a breath of fresh air in the relatively mediocre indian food options we have in the phoenix area
hallelujah
that said
they're not quite into our regular rotation for a few key reasons
the service needs some work
too often we found ourselves waiting for soda water refills
etc
this might be because the location was relatively new when we went there
so i'm willing to not slam them on this as much as i would a more established place
pick_it_up guys
some of the dishes seemed to err just a bit on salt msg side common in some cheaper chineese restaurants
again
they were new and were probably still dialing things in
all that said
those draw backs weren't really bad enough to prevent us from going there again
because honestly the food is that much fun
and vegetarians
eat here
lots of nummy nummy goodness for you
and protip
chili paneer
yum_yum
eat it
the food here is fantastic
indochinese food is a unique type of cuisine you can't find everywhere
the flavor profiles are interesting and complex
good decor and good prices
friendly_staff
new location near my office in scottsdale
we ordered items for to go lunch
fried egg plant
chili_chicken and shrimp szechwan style
all were swimning in gooey sauces
two of the sauces tasted identical
eggplant was good
but there were only few pieces and it was smothered in dark sauces
not sure why all are so soupy
reading from all the reviews here
i wonder if i went to the same inchin's bamboo garden
what's indo_chinese
i went in with open mind to try new cuisine
may be indo_chinese isn't for me
may try again
though
sunny az
amazing place
the first place i liked that actually serves indochinese food
their schezwan chicken and burnt garlic fried_rice are remarkable
also
they are quick with service and quantity of food is worth what you pay for
all in all great place
the chili_chicken was delicious
reasonable portion_size
good indian asian beer_selection
definitely will come back and try other dishes
quiet
attractive decor
great food
service could be more proactive
we got the 'drums of heaven' to start with
they were very well seasoned and full of flavor
for our main_course we had chicken manchurian which was decent but the cauliflower manchurian was definately a better dish
hakka noodles
american chopsuey were decent as well
overall it was a good experience and i will be dining there again
also
it would be nice to have some outdoor seating
very quiet over lunch hour
was exactly what i was looking for too
however i hope they aren't relying on their lunch crowd for business
because it's lacking
the food was great
for soup
veggie egg roll and mixed veggies and brown_rice
ladies working were super_nice and i enjoyed their company while sitting at the bar
i'll be back
super spicy just the way i like it
the food was great
was little oily but tasted really good
the service was also fast
i felt it was little expensive especially the gratuity they added themselves for a party of
on the whole a must try place
phenomenal
been here twice
it's about a half an_hour drive from me
but imo it's pretty worth it
i am not an_expert_on_indian and chinese cuisine
but this fusion was just very flavorful and tasteful
they have this paneer cheese appetizer and it tastes so savory and the texture is perfect
it's a bit spicy
but i love the heat
the first time i went
it was a sunday evening and it was soo packed and it really affected the service
it was understandable
and it looked like it was taking a toll on our server
but the food really outshined
the second time i went was the following tuesday
believe it or not
it was soo much better and calmer
it was such an enjoyable experience
there was this server who brought the food out and really took his time to set the plates of food down equidistant from all other plates
it was strange
but pleasantly appreciated
the server that took our order was very friendly too and offered really great recommendations
i cannot recall the names if the dishes
but one_of_my_favorites was a fish in a chili cream_sauce
i'll be coming_back
great place for asian cuisine
if you order fiery
have a glass_of_water next to you it really will be fiery
overall ambience is very nice however the music killed the mood
it's a very warm
cozy next to the fireplace type of ambience with rihanna playing in the background
it was out of place
overall great place for lunch and dinner with friends and family
tried the american chopsuey
tad too much sweet sauce for my taste
the fried_rice was spiced right
one of the best places in us that serves indo_chinese food
the other place that comes to mind similar to inchin is the chinese mirch on the east coast
out of the two inchin wins in the food quality and taste and the options
also it stands_out pretty well in terms of the ambience and service
the pan fried chilli paneer and 'drums of heaven' are the shining stars of the big menu
schezuan fried_rice and cauliflower manchurian fares out pretty decent too
if you are in the phoenix area
inchin is definitely worth_the_trip
went for dinner last_night and the place did_not_disappoint
we were a big party
but were lucky enough to get one of those big booth tables
and got some privacy from the rest of the hall
the food was delicious and the best indian chinese i've had in the us
my personal favorites are the chili_chicken
chili potatoes
and the basil chicken rice
so good
our server was pretty good too
yes
it takes a while for the food to get served
but hey have you seen how busy they are on weekend nights
we waited for a bit
but the food was definitely worth_the_wait
oh btw
while you wait
you can always read up on chinese signs and pick on people at your table
haha
definitely recommended
they have gone from a variety of sauces to nothing
i mean nothing not even plain chili sauce
sucks
one of a few restaurants that offer indianised chinese_food
this is as_good_as_it_gets
i came here skeptical
but left a fan
everything we ordered was good and tasted great
the ambience is also very nice
if you have never tried this cuisine
i highly_recommend that your try it here
the paneer appetizer was amazing
just loved it
entree was just fine
service was slow
maybe we reached very close to the closing time
ordered a mango mojito which was basically mango frutti ith a hint of bacardi
in short wasnt worth it
i would recommend it as a one time visit
as it is the only indo_chinese restaurant around
this was my first taste of indo_chinese food after coming to the united states
so there may be a possibility that my opinion is slightly biased
firstly
the ambiance is definitely worth mentioning
i wasn't dining in and so cannot comment on the service
but the lady who took my order was very courteous and welcoming
they even accepted my yelp coupon and gave me a discount
the food
dinner order of a starter
rice and curry
was sufficient for people easily
the starter
chicken
was excellent
the rice too was pretty spicy and good
the chicken curry
i guess it was chilly chicken
could_have_been_better
the pricing was definitely not cheap
but again wasn't too expensive either
so
considering i have this place less than a mile away from home
i don't think i have any complaints
this place is indo_chinese
very nice d_cor
cool atmosphere
if you like indian
thai or chinese_food you will probably like this place
the food has a lot of flavor and spice to it
if you are indian
this is like little india inside with all the clientele
so a great place to take your indian parent who are super picky
one note
their apps are better than their entrees
i think they do dry currys the best but with wet currys they are not as good
if you love spicy food
this is the place to be
the chinese_food has indian touch to it which i simply love and die for
portions are little small for the price
but thats all i can have with so many chillies added
washrooms have to be worked on
have to be cleaner
and there was no diaper changing table
which was a discomfort
loved the pan fried paneer and the hakka noodles
main points
unique cuisine with a great ambiance
offers different sauces at table to customize flavors
family_style
servings make it good for groups
review
inchin offers a wide_variety of fusion indian chinese_food
with the focus leaning more towards chinese cuisine
i tried a few vegetarian and non vegetarian_dishes
and all were appetizing
my group particularly liked the crispy lamb peking
the ambiance was very appealing
modern asian decor
great for a date when you're tired of the same old food restaurant choices
the
burnt garlic chili fried_rice
sounded like it would be amazing
but there wasn't really much substance to it just lightly flavored rice with a hint of chili spice
also some of the entrees
though they were different sauce choices
tasted almost identical if not for the different meats selected
however
the tables come equipped with a variety of sauces
so you can customize your meal to your taste
definitely give this place a try
you'll be happy you did
our office has been going to this place for almost years and we loved it
they have recently moved the location to cactus and have adopted the
chipotle
style of serving and scaled back the menu
we had it for the first time since the change and we wont be going back
ever
very sad
at the tatum store the food service were always good
that is no longer true
i wanted something light
so i ordered the lentil soup
it was extremely watery with tons of salt
in fact i think it had more salt than lentils
the lentils were not even cooked thoroughly
it was so bad
i asked to exchange it and they refused
my dining companion had a rice bowl
the rice was undercooked and barely warm
she tried all of the sauces
and liked the curry
spinach
and vindaloo
the masala was too sweet
loved the location on tatum and shea but since they moved and adopted a new
chipotle
style concept it has completely gone down hill
the food is bland and sitting in containers for who knows how long
what a disappointment and i will not be going back or referring it to my friends
bring back the old restaurant and awesome cooks where everything tastes fresh and hot
what a disappointment at bombay_spice grill tonight
we were fans of the full service restaurant that operated nearby
but the change to fast casual misses the mark completely
i am going to assume that the restaurant group behind the treasured roka akor and nobuo is no longer affiliated with bombay_spice
what a change from the attentive servers and the well thought out menu
the hip decorations and carefully programmed music
the place has all the vibe of the dmv
with glaring cfl lighting and sparing decoration
this just opened and the walls had marks and the floor was worn in spots
the serving plates and utensils seemed to be of the lowest grade
while the napkins were just a little larger than a paper bar napkin and not as soft
the hot samosa melted the tines of the fork
we went there knowing that they made the change to the concept
i get the chipotle style ordering and was able to figure_out what i wanted
i had chicken masala over rice
while the lady had the same with steak
plus veggies
we also ordered one naan and some samosas
we both found that the rice was old and dry and the meat overcooked
the naan was half a piece
cut in half
the samosas were dry and overcooked and weren't ready until we were about to leave
we were nickel and dimes for all these extras
including sauces
bombay_spice
i will give you one more try in a month
if the food is better
i'll consider you an alternative to the sub shop next_door
i'll order a
plate of food
you'll never sell me any go alongs and i'll never bring a group of friends
as i did withe the old concept
you're not a cool wine bar with healthier indian food
anymore
also
don't eat outside
that parking_lot has smelled like sewer since
major fail
once a frequent diner at the old sit_down dining bombay_spice on shea
i ventured here hoping to find the same delicious flavorful healthy indian food
instead i found an indian restaurant set up like a chipotle
but not executed nearly as well
the food lacked flavor and the portions were much smaller than the old location
my heart is broken i love love loved the old bombay_spice
my wife and i have what we call good
food dar
if we hate the look of a place
we usually avoid it
and the accompanying bad experiences
date_night at the old bombay_spice was a tradition with their healthy menu
great atmosphere and excellent wines
we tried out the new location with the expectation that we would be happy
what a terrible disappointment
this review really breaks down into two categories
what we think about the establishment as it is now
and how it compares to the old place
which was a solid star_rating
we walked in and were greeted_by ray
the head cook from the old spice
he has real skills
so we gave him a chance
but alarm bells were going off
the sauces had brown deposits around their edges in the warmer
the meats had been there for a while
we ordered masala with chicken
chickpea_ceviche and some samosas
another guy was there
but not really helping
just standing around
ray explained that this was a
chipotle style
program now
my immediate thought was that it was an affront to chipotle to even compare
maybe theoretically
chipotle esque
perhaps
our food was slopped into some pretty nice take out containers
we kept them
as they are washable
and we headed for the table
the masala was awful
if that sauce is not out of a can
then they should move up to canned sauce
the rice and quinoa were dry
the chicken was grainy and flaccid
the samosas were starchy
spice less and pulpy
the chickpea_ceviche had all the flavor of canned chickpeas
no tamarind_sauce was present
we doctored up the masala with hot_sauce to make it edible and took a few bites
i looked at val
she glanced at the door
ray smiled at us
we were trapped
please understand that if you give that chef good ingredients
he is a magician
but if you cut your ingredient costs to the bone and buy garbage
that is what you will serve
pre make everything
and it slips further downhill
the veggies were clearly a heavily spiced food service vegetable medley
is anyone in the paradise valley area looking for a talented chef
save him from this hell
please
and let all the former spice customers know so we can come to your place
i said i would compare this to the old bombay_spice
but it's not worth it
they are not at all the same thing
there is no atmosphere
no wine bar
no lovely
caring servers
but it costs pretty much the same
not
awesome
it is like running into your high school girlfriend
the one who was the love of your young life
and she is a toothless meth addict trying to get a stolen atm onto her bicycle
that's how much i hurt for you
bombay_spice
tough love time
you have gone from being my favorite indian place to the single worst indian food i have ever eaten
i have heaved out my guts in a hotel bathroom after eating better indian food than this
so i am cutting you off
don't call me
don't email
i loved you so much that i can't see you like this
maybe some day i will see golden light pouring out of your windows and happy customers sitting at the bar
drinking great wine and eating fantastic food
and i'll come in
maybe we will be friends again
but it will never be what it was
goodbye
what a disappointment
they changed to a
fast_food cafeteria
style of service
which you know actually means less service for you
their old place was nice since you had table service from a very nice menu and you were able to sit and enjoy your meal
now it's just
rush in rush out
and the experience is far from enjoyable
i've recently seen this style of service at an indian restaurant near my home and they have closed within a few months of opening
the portions are smaller
the menu selection reduced to a few basics
and the prices are ridiculous for what you get
and they promote
healthy
but no longer offer stevia as a sweetener
instead your choices are sugar or health damaging chemicals as a substitute
does any if this make sense to you
if not
then go elsewhere
heck
chipotle is just across_the_street and they have better food and value for your money
hugely disappointing
big fans frequent customers of the tatum shea location for years
this new concept is a bust
small portions
limited food options
plastic ware everywhere
sad to say we won't be back
i've been to the old location and loved it
when i saw that it was opening up a wee bit closer to my house
i was ecstatic
but that didn't last very long when i showed_up and saw what the place had turned into
it's no longer a place i want to bring my friends to
it's a fast_food_joint now and it's quite disappointing
the last times i was there
the meat and tofu was dried up and the quinoa as well
i think i would much rather go next_door to genghis grill than eat dry indian food that has been sitting out for who knows how long
even the samosas were cold
i don't even want to order wine to pair my food in a plastic container
one cashier said they were going to change it up and go back to the old ways but i don't see that happening anytime soon
i'm gonna give the place one more try before i go looking for a new indian restaurant
it's with a heavy heart that i bring you this review of the once beloved bombay_spice
you're dead to me now
i was a huge fan and frequent diner at the old location
i loved bringing friends there and my husband and i enjoyed the wednesday date_night special on more than one occasion
unfortunately
those are just memories
there is no way i would go here to enjoy a glass_of_wine and samosa or curry
this new location looks like a crappy diner and the
chipotle style
order line just misses the mark
the servers literally just dump food into the to go containers and man the till
the food quality and quantity has plummeted
not to mention the lost appeal of fresh food
i have some friends who eat a vegan diet and they appreciated the ability to request modifications to their meals
not such
any more
the lentil soup was reminiscent of the old recipe but came with about three bites and was bland overall
rip
bombay of olde
i think it's unfair to judge the new restaurant and the new concept by the old location
the food in the new location is fast
fresh
healthy
the portion substantial
i'll eat my leftovers for tomorrow's lunch
and most_importantly flavorful
the chicken was truly grilled to perfection with wonderful spices blackening it a bit
the veggies
even though in a warming dish were crunchy
spiced
not spicy hot though
and cooked just right
chick_peas
carrots
broccoli
and cauliflower
and all were fantastic and appropriate
what a wonderful alternative to chipotle
burgers
pizza
fast_food
and all of the sub chains in the area and certainly a lot healthier
less expensive and quicker than ghengis khan next_door
yasu's is the only other alternative for a
good
lunch
everything else is just standard
i had been to the old location once
several years_ago
and while i love indian food
and thought there's was pretty good
the environment was sterile
the food overpriced
and the sit_down experience awkward
say compared to an indian buffet where you know what to expect or an upscale scottsdale eatery of which the old location was neither
i think this concept makes the flavors of india more accessible to the common man or those intimated by an indian buffet or a more
persian
style sit_down place who might otherwise be intimated
i really encourage anyone wanting something fast
fresh
healthy and a little different to try this place and i hope it stays around giving us pv phoenix scottsdale folks a very nice
affordable
tasty alternative to pizza
burgers and subs
only suggestions are
the menu board needs descriptions of the flavors to help the intimidated
what kind of curry is it
red
yellow
etc
what does marsala taste like or what is it made of
what the heck is
vindaloo
any ways
also
why no tikka
that should be standard or maybe i missed it
i like spicy
please
let each of the dishes be
spiced
up to taste
kind of like traditional thai fair
mild
medium and extremely hot
i agree with the one
don't nickel dime me to death
comment
at least sell me a
combo
where the bowl comes with naan_bread
who eats indian food without naan_bread
or the wrap comes with a samosa or a drink or an optional side of rice
don't forget to put a fork and napkin in my
to go
bag or mention it
just in case i forget like i did today
such a bummer
turned a nice restaurant with delicious food into a fast_food_joint with mediocre food
booooo
i never went to the original location
and frankly don't know what all the crybabying is about
you can see what this place
has become
as the full restaurant is viewable from the entirely windowed front of the place
anyway
this place is kinda lame and possibly misleading
it urges you to
think healthy
with that phrase plastered on the windows in a very obnoxious repeating subliminal pattern
but this is some of the most greasy indian_food_i've_ever_had
i don't get why the spinach sauce has to be so oily
maybe it makes sense for masala as it uses butter or cream or something
but i felt_like they just went nuts with the oils in the sauce
seems to me that adds a lot more calories than what they post
the tv plays this hilarious but demeaning indian tv channel that shows indian gangster rappers or something
it's wild and probably off putting to the high brow folks who have given this place a bad review based_on its past incarnation
i just think it's stupid and silly
not sure what the owner's thinking
despite the hoity toity crowd's whining
they are right about one thing
this place is fastfoodish
looks like all the fixins come from a bag
and it's like a hospital cafeteria
sure am glad my entree was free with some card i got to try the place
anyone who pays for this is a sucker
great food
reasonably_priced and large portions
i like the wide assortment of grilled veggies as well as the addition of tofu as a protein option
choose a base
quinoa
brown or basmati_rice
a protein
beef
chicken
tofu
choose your veggies and a sauce or as i like to do it
a blend of sauces
having brought multiple friends here as first timers
i have gotten nothing but excellent responses from them
i appreciate the vegetarian and vegan_options and my friends enjoy the beef and chicken options
everything has been tasty tasty tasty
i was a fan of the old bombay and continue to be a fan probably because i come for the food
not the atmosphere
while hesitant about the change at first
i now enjoy the flexibility that this style of restaurant provides
for those who only came when it first opened
some things have changed including the assortment of available vegetables
as a vegan diner
i was a little concerned about my options
however
i think they've done a good job of adapting to a changing market as well as the input of their loyal customers
now
if i could just get them to bring the korma sauce back
something that caught my eye immediately that seemed pretty odd but pretty cool was the chef was walking around to peoples tables and asking them how their meal was
he was also offering free samples of the lemonade and the chai
that's generally not what i expect when i go to a place like that
that gets points in my book
i've been to a lot of indian food restaurants all over us and this is definitely one of the good ones
i've also spent a lot of time eating fresh homemade indian food so i'm a bit if a snob and always a bit skeptical anytime i step foot in a new indian restaurant
long story somewhat short
i tried a lot of what they had on the menu because i wanted to know how everything taste
i realized before i ordered that this indian food is intended to be a more healthy style of indian food so i wasn't sure what to think
once i dug in i could definitely tell that it was a lighter style of indian food
still had all the great flavors but it wasn't has heavy as the indian food i normally eat is
all the sauces were awesome
all the veggies were really fresh
the style and the way you order is pretty cool because you can see everything right in front of your face and mix and match with your dish
i can't really think of anything bad to say about the place
i did like some sauces more than others but nothing was bad
i def plan to stop in more often
the longer story for ya readers out there
the vindaloo was really awesome
perfect amount of spiciness to it and def a must have for next time
the curry was probably my favorite
it was really really good
i could mix that with just about anything at home
not oily
not to much flavoring
i'd love to buy a jug of it and smother some wings
the masala was also really good and i def didn't leave any behind
the mint_chutney was really cool
it was zesty and next time i go back i'm gonna get a wrap and have a bunch draped over my chicken
the tamarind_chutney was nice because it wasn't too thick and sugary
it was a nice little addition over my rice
i tried all the meats and they were definitely good
i favored the chicken and tofu over the beef but it was still good
i'm not really a tofu kind of guy but it was definitely good to have in the bowl
it was kind of like having chunks of pineer
the mango_lassie was aw aw awesome
i've never really had one that i didn't like though but some have been to thin for my likings
the manager asked me if i wanted to sample the chai and the lemonade so i did
i've never thought i'd get so excited about lemonade but that lemonade was absolutely awesome
i'd like to make some good cocktails with it
if it was on the shelf in the grocery_store i probably buy it once a week
the chai was also really really good
i've always loved cardamom and that chai was packed full of it
it definitely didn't taste like anything else i've ever had
i liked how it was cold too
there was also a hot_sauce that they gave to me on my plate and it definitely has some kick but it's got really good flavor too
it was perfect because most of their sauces are pretty mild but i like some heat added so it worked out well
all in all
i'll definitely go back
it's nice to find a place that isn't the same as everyone_else
one cool thing i noticed
i didn't feel really weighed down after i finished
a lot of the time after eating indian food
i'm ready for bed
the staff was cool and friendly and the place was super clean
definitely check them out
if the place is busy and the bald chef isn't walking around offering samples
ask him for one
i'm sure he'll give em to you
new location new format old name
indian food is often relegated to lunch_buffets and white table cloth dinners
bsg offers a new take on how indian can be done
the build to order layout is familiar for anyone who likes burritos
pick a bowl or wrap
rice type
protein type
veggies and sauce and avid the pricey extras
a meal can be had for
i had brown_rice
tofu
all of the veggies with a truly spicy vindaloo sauce
this is not the best indian by far as your protein and veggies do not simmer in the sauce
not is any one part of major note
the real reason for a decent score here is the ability to get some good flavors quickly and at a decent value
this place was so much better with it's previous format
they dropped half the menu and made it more like chipotle rather than a sit_down restaurant
the food is no longer cooked in the sauced
but merely topped with it
after knowing what this place was like previously
i am very disappointed
really and a half
but the guys here were nice
decent sauces
veggies
lassi
great lemonade
so so chicken
i'd prefer a buffet for this money
we used to frequent bombay_spice when they were located at shea tatum and always enjoyed our dining_experience
we even ordered from them using delicious deliveries on a regular_basis
now since they have moved they changed the way they serve their food and we love it
the service was always great and that has not changed
they brought back the bhel_puri and made it more of a fast_food setting
we look_forward to even more visits to enjoy their great food
not the same level of food as it's old location
this new style reminds me of chipotle
except not as great
i've been there twice and each time i've been a little unenthusiastic about the presentation
but the taste is still great
for me
it's plenty of food
others may think differently
we never went to shea
and this is our first visit here
i was surprised it is like a fast_food place
i am kind of naive that way
p
so ordering and getting your food seems to be fast
and the employees were very helpful and friendly
i had a coupon and they were very patient explaining the terms to me
we got bowls
one drink
one naan and one order of the crispy chip like stuff
pappadum
total was
food itself is like stars
i was not that crazy about it
but i bumped it to for these reasons
service was good
they had the following options
basmati_rice
brown_rice and quinoa
kudos for the quinoa
aaaaand
the vindaloo sauce is in fact hot spicy
which is a great thing for us
tamarind_chutney was delicious
very good food
i liked the curry but i think the masala is better
i would def get a side of naan and veggie_samosa
the two guys working were very friendly
ok
so the old bombay_spice was one of my favorite restaurants
and then they moved and their reviews here weren't great
so i stayed away
but recently i noticed their reviews improved
so today myself and a friend went for lunch and i am happy to say that bombay_spice is once again one_of_my_favorites
their menu has switched to a more chipotle like way of service and a couple of my old favorites weren't on the new menu
but i asked about them and was told they could make them for me
i ordered one of those favorites and a wrap from the new menu
my old favorite
the chickpea_ceviche
was as good as i remember
so fresh tasting
light and comparable to nothing else
just great for what it is
the wrap i had was gigantic enough for two meals and also really delicious
my friend had a bowl with chicken
rice
veggies and the vindaloo sauce
she loved it
it is a very spicy sauce but not spicy just for the sake of being spicy
it was spicy but flavorful
she thanked me for introducing her to bombay_spice and we will_definitely_go_back
as it was before
it is also a good value
gigantic wrap was
i think and way more than i could eat for one meal
service was also good and everything appeared clean and tidy
this is a great place to get something different for lunch or a quick dinner
i love the chicken masala wrap
as the other reviewers have said
it is a
chipotle
type setup
as in
you choose your rice
your protein
veggies
and sauce
it's really an excellent wrap
i also love the bombay_spice iced_tea yum
i can't believe people are sitting next_door eating a bland jimmy johns sandwich when they could be having one of these exotic concoctions
i am really sad people are giving this place bad reviews
but i never went to the original location
so i'm not sure what they are comparing it to
if you are coming in looking for a traditional_indian restaurant
that is not what this is
so set your expectations accordingly
i miss the old location
they tried to make it indian chipotle now and the food just isn't the same quality
it's really a shame
my boyfriend and i used to love the old one as a date spot and it's gone forever
i wish they would bring back their traditional restaurant style of service like they had in their old location
this has gone way down hill since_moving to this location
the food they offer is decent but nothing like they used to serve
the menu has been scaled down tremendously
please bring back the original bombay_spice
i love indian food
yet i'd never heard of bombay_spice when they were in their original locations just a mile away from where they move to several months_ago
a friend notice their new locations so we went
the majority of the photos i'd reviewed on yelp are not from this new location
the former place was more upscale in atmosphere whereas the new place is more of a fast_food type place where you go up and order your food
not necessarily a bad thing
the owner chief brought us our food because it was taking them just a little time to get things ready and he was extremely friendly and sat with us for awhile
the idea of and inexpensive fast indian restaurant is a good one
they changed their formula from their former location he told us
they have another new place with this same formula they just opened in downtown chicago
they give very large portions
i ate only half of mine and took the rest home for the next day
prices_are_very_reasonable
however when comparing taste to other indian_restaurants
almost all more expensive
in the valley they don't measure up
i'd go back here
but if i wanted good tasting indian food i'd go elsewhere
i will give them another try at some point
great owner
staff
large portions
supposedly healthy and inexpensive
a nice combination
but when i want indian food
i want good taste
we enjoyed a tasty meal here two excellent curries
prepared exactly as we ordered them
very spicy
naan was reasonably_priced
and just right hot
fresh
but not drenched in butter
we were shocked to get such good indian food in a suburban location in a city not known for its indian_cuisine
apparently this location used to host a restaurant called india gate
restaurant
com is still selling vouchers for india gate
this new location won't honor them ask them if they're india gate
and they'll say yes
i asked
is this india gate
and the hostess replied
yes
one of their menus still says india gate
but expect them to honor the discount
and you'll be disappointed
they initially claimed to be totally unaware of the problem but on further questioning admitted that at least one other customer had come in with the same problem
follow up emails were equally unsuccessful at resolution
i'd give them stars for food
maybe even in light of the alternatives in the area
but unethical behavior like this earns a huge drop
soo yummy
i've been to several buffets and have had many homemade meals at friends' houses
this buffet is very good
not sure where the bad reviews are coming from
the food is very flavorful
the best is the fried vegetable that is a circle
maybe eggplant
the mushroom mattar and chicken_tikka
naan is not that great but everything else is so satisfying and good
i can't_wait_to_go_back
oh they aren't open for buffets on monday anymore
found that out the hard way
i have to agree with kira
i work in the building directly next_door to minerva
so we watched with anticipation as they took over the spot that was formerly occupied by china star
notes
opens at
am for a lunch buffet
we arrived at
am and they weren't ready
tables were nearly filled before they were ready to go
so we made our trip through the buffet at around
pm
nice selection of various dishes
all were very tasty and well prepared
limited selection
overall
seems to cater to more popular items
which is smart
but if_you're_looking to try something different
it's unlikely to be on the buffet
friendly_staff
prompt service
waters were always refilled
plates quickly cleared away
reasonable_prices
very dirty inside
lots of construction dust
and just general dirt
never once saw waitstaff wipe down tables after people finished_eating
they'd clear them
dust
them off
and then set new settings
no area to wait
there was a line of people waiting to be seated
limited seating available
so
i liked the food
i liked the staff
dirt doesn't really bother me
but i couldn't help but notice just how unkempt the place seemed
especially for being newly opened
i hope they can get some time to scrub things down and that they more regularly wipe down tables between diners
heck yeah
talk about the system working
props to matt who started the awesome thread on yelp madison talk re
openings and closings
http
www
yelp
com topic madison the official madison openings and closings comings and goings thread
and thanks to steve for letting the community know about this new indian_joint on junction rd
it may have taken me a few months to get her otherwise
i was bouncing around the threads last_night
saw
indian
and got in the car
i called on my way to make sure they were actually open
folks
this is easily the best indian food i've found in madison for three reasons
the menu
holy cow
it's huge
i went for dinner and spent forever pouring over each and every page
looking up a few items on my phone because they were new to me
no shortage of variety here
the dosas
this and this alone should make you speed over
i think they have
that's nuts
nuts
i'm used to seeing maybe or different kinds at a place
the flavor
everything i tried was incredible
and although spice heat is key to indian cooking
theirs is well balanced
and not so hot that you can't taste anything
i had vegetable jalfrezi
chicken_tikka_masala
masala_dosa and garlic_naan
all of it was awesome
get these things
even the garlic_naan
which i sort of feel like is tough to make incredible
but it was incredible
it arrived at the table piping_hot and aromatic and didn't have an offensive garlic flavor
the chicken_tikka_masala was some of the best i've had
topping some of the curry i long for in london
the veggies were tender yet crisp and in a super tasty sauce
and the dosa
ohhhh the dosa
it was good
not my favorite
but with so many options
i can't wait to get back and try another one
maybe more adventurous than this one
huge props to the stellar staff that made sure we had no questions about the menu
kept water glasses full
and told us they will have beer wine liquor soon
just wrapping up some paperwork
they also sent us home with leftovers in boxes and gave_us extra rice
very kind
the atmosphere ain't much
so don't go expecting to be transported to india or anything
there is some nice stuff hand painted on one wall
but that's about it
small space
bright light
no tunes playing the night i was there
i didn't notice construction dirt or dust so i'm guessing they cleaned up after what sounds like a rushed opening
and my feeling has always been
if i'm there the first week
i'm going to make a few exceptions anyway knowing they're still trying to find their footing
these_guys have though
and if food remains consistent
this will be my go to for indian stuffs in madison
read corey's review earlier today and decided to revisit with a group of coworkers
amazing how well the business responds to feedback kudos to them
tables wiped down with cleaner after each diner finished
saw it happen every time
looks like they're cleaning up the last little bits of leftover construction stuff
much better than yesterday
food was once again superb
i tried an entirely different round of items and loved every_single thing
the buffet is not only a bargain
but it is delicious
service was excellent quick refills on drinks
plates cleared
buffet well_stocked
and everyone was so friendly
so
huge props to the folks running this place keep up the great work
and i can't_wait_to_go_back and visit again
and i'm sure i will
at last
madison has a place that serves proper
dum biriyani
all the other indian restaurants_in_madison serve some sort of weird amalgam of pulao and chicken fried_rice but this is the real deal
try it out if you have never done so before
another thing i liked about this place was their menu
it was really broad and covered multiple sub types of indian_cuisine mainly northern
chinese
yes
southern
i haven't had to try the northern or the chinese but if the food i had was anything to go by it should all be good
i tried out the chicken dum biriyani chettinadu and both were awesome
the chettinadu was a bit too spicy for my palate
and i like spicy food and have higher threshold than most
but biriyani more than made up for it
since they just opened a week or two ago i'll have to update this review after i try the dinner
lunch buffet was good but unfortunately at a buffet most places tone down the spice_level
which may be a plus for most people
given that this place is minutes away from swagat
my go to indian buffet
and minutes away from dhaba
not a buffet
but pretty good
i think they have some stiff competition
however
the dinner menu
online
has a pretty wide_variety of dishes that i don't think you'll find at the other places
so i'm looking_forward to trying that
oh
and for my year_old they have chicken nuggets on the menu
cause he ain't fooled by chicken pakora
service was nice and friendly they kept coming around with dosas
which was nice
kinda a weird cramped layout with the seating
the place almost seems too small for a buffet
all in all
if you like indian food i'd recommend giving it a try
i love indian food and am quite picky about it
there are very few tremendous indian restaurants_in_madison
this is the top
the spice and flavor was delicious and the gulab_jamun was so phenom so make sure you save room
i generally do not like buffets at indian_restaurants either because of the options available or because the quality is not good enough
the buffet at minerva surprised me
it was actually very good
some of the things you can look_forward to
malai_kofta was very creamy
mango_ice_cream tastier than usual
garlic_naan was soft
paneer_tikka max masala but tasty
something to note
the menu has a lot of options
minera is one of the lousiest indian eatery places in madison
service sucks
there is not even a single good thing about this restaurant
the owner has no idea about how to run a restaurant business
in the era of technological advancement and social networking
the business does not have a running website
lunch buffet is a 'copycat' of another restaurant in town
minerva tried to even place the same items in the same location as the other one they don't have any originality
and surprisingly they have the same items even
can't they have something different of their own
standard of lunch buffet is nothing great
even food quality of dinner is nothing to die for
tables are too small and cramped up
a person table is ideally suited for persons
the restaurant is very small and cramped up
when people line up for the buffet
it is a complete chaos
for dinner
the person tables do not even have a table cloth
wait_staff sucks they don't have any idea of what they are doing
in dinner there is no control of the ordering status
the wait_staff has no idea whose order is what and when the food comes out the staff does not does not know in which table to bring the food
it's a big chaos
amongst this
the turnover time for the food to come out after order is placed is rather quick
which is appreciated
we tried certain dosas
the south_indian delicacy in which the restaurant specializes in
the dosas came without the sides
sambar
chutney
had to ask for the same
which is ridiculous
the sambar
chutney was stale and had no great taste
sambar felt_like having grains of sand in it
the other families who were dining with us in other tables were equally unhappy with the service
we ordered a rava masala_dosa they messed up and an onion rava dosa came out
when we mentioned that the ordered was messed
they took it back inside the kitchen and put the masala in a small bowl and brought it back out
that was terrible
appetizers are served in small side dishes of corelle brand
the restaurant even does not have proper serving bowls
they purchased cheap dishes for serving food
this is a substandard restaurant
they have made the menu_items very attractive encompassing all different platter but that has back fired on them
nothing is turning out great
had they emphasized on their strength and specialized on south_indian platter
they would done a better job
the south_indian food is great
tried chicken times
the meat was terrible every_single time
they do a decent job with the curry so i kept giving them a chance
bad idea the meat is always horrible and sometimes even stale
the staff is friendly
the menu is huge
i wish they could back it up with quality
it varies based_on what you order
i guess they try to offer too much and its not good value_for_money with stale meat entrees
i'm on the fence with this one
will write another review after i try hyderabadi and other types of dishes i haven't given them a chance with yet
def no chicken though
yuck
i would give a
stars if i could
stupid yelp
i am honestly surprised at the negative reviews
but disclaimer i have never been to lunch
i generally find indian_lunch_buffets
blah
i have been to dinner three times
and the food is great
their service needs some help
see below
so here is the thing i have lived in madison for yrs
and the indian food scene has been very similar a lot of mughlai food
the restaurants improve or go down depending_on competition
minerva offers a breath of fresh air in this routine
yes they have the usual tikka masala
garlic_naan
mango_lassi
etc
all approved by my caucasian husband
but they have dosas
idlis
chettinad and indian chineese
cuisine that is great as well
that i have missed and really enjoyed
so here is the break down
pros
extensive_menu for dinner that will appeal to both indians and non indians alike
awesome true dum_biryani
chicken is all tangy and flavored right
andhra spicy dosa is good
and actually spicy
food always comes out quickly
cons
weird layout
seem short staffed always nice and courteous
but needed more people
lacking ambiance
tallying the bill always seems to take a while
overall food is my first priority so minerva is a keeper
as an indian i think i view minerva and dhaba as the best indian restaurants_in_madison right now
while the restaurant may be going through some opening pains
no website
opens at noon at weekends instead of
somewhat cramped quarters
the food is superb and the staff remarkably kind and friendly
i'm hopeful it will just get better with time
and perhaps find they need a larger location
the page menu is a real treat in itself with something for everyone
that there is so much south_indian makes this a great spot for those needing to avoid gluten
i really enjoyed the lunch buffet the couple_of_times that i have been here
i am not familiar with the names of many of the dishes but i know that i really loved the flavors of many of the dishes
they have fantastic rice and lots of meat options
i am a big goat fan
no judgement please
and i want to say it's among the best that i have had in the city
the service in this place is also standout
the few times i have been here the staff have been extremely accommodating and ultra pleasant
i am happy that this place has opened up so close to my office as i foresee many visits in my future
my job brings me out to lunch for indian food quite frequently
so i'm glad there's now another option on_the_west_side
i'm usually accompanied_by indian dining companions when i hit the buffet
but this time our group of gringos
yeah
yeah
i know indians don't call us that
was on its own
fortunately i was aided by some indian fellows behind me at the buffet who had eaten there before
so i only had the good stuff on my plate
the food was good tandoori_chicken cooked just right
masala stewed with the right blend_of_spices
mango_ice_cream to freaking die for
minerva might lack the ambiance of swagat or my favorite
dhaba
but the buffet food is right up there with swagat's
minerva is in a location that seems to cursed
its predecessors had a tough go
but they're doing it up right and have as good a chance as anyone to make it a go here
my boyfriend and i went to this restaurant last sunday for the first time and we tried the buffet and since we started to eat we noticed the difference between the other indian_restaurants we have been to and this one and minerva it's so much better
every_single thing we tried was sooo tasty
my favorites were
the chili_chicken
the channa_masala
garbanzo beans in a creamy sauce
the deep_fried vegetables
they were sooo crispy
and their cottage_cheese
it was sooo delicate i did not want to finish eating it
we would_definitely_come_back for more
the only reason i gave them stars its because the buffet area it is so small and i think they should rearrange it
they have the main entrees in the narrower side where most of the people stand most of the time
they should put them in the beginning area
where everybody start to get their empty plates since it is a more open area
oh
no i hate to downgrade these_guys because the staff is so friendly
it's a clean place and they work hard and do so much the right way
however
there are other_indian_places that sell my_favorite_dish for about the same price
but use tender chunks of white_meat chicken
my vindaloo here had what i assume is dark meat
with what many of what i consider to be inedible pieces
tough
grisly
veiny
fatty
i'm not going to rule out returning here
but if the price of an entree is going to be comparable to the competition
i would suggest to match their quality as well
for the aforementioned reasons
i wish these_guys the best and i will be back
i hope my suggestion helps
i probably will not end up back here anytime soon
the food itself was very unique in the way it tastes seasoned
some of the dishes were quite spicy for general buffet options but i don't knock it for that
some other broken english star_review user review only exists for this which honestly screams a review by a competing restaurant yet i agree with a bit
the largest problem is the space
space and service
our server
not sure if we had one assigned
seemed new or nervous and spilled water all over
after changing seats
we were more or less ignored beyond our initial drink
there was little communication as to who our actual server was and wasn't even sure where to get the bill
after a while of being ignored
we just walked up and got it
but lets face the ultimate problem the space
it is like taqueria guadalajara seating combined with a buffet table set in a strange corner alcove
the buffet table itself even borders tables where you may be seated
do you like having people constantly standing right by you grabbing food or lining up
the strangest thing is when you get to the end of the buffet line
it's a dead end and you have to like walk awkwardly around people to try to get out
it seems nonsensical
and like another review said when there is a lot of people waiting to be seated the place has a very strange limbo zone by the door where you can't really get in or heck even goto the bathrooms from the dining_area
i just don't think the space itself is suitable for an indian buffet
buffets need a lot of spacing for the constant amount of people getting up
lining up and returning to their seats as well as a logical flow and layout for the buffet plates
instead it is a dead end with seating similar to a high school cafeteria
be prepared to sit next to strangers
i'm hooked on the lunch buffet
they have a good variety and serve some different items than the other indian_buffets i've been to while still remaining familiar
the two things that enamor me to minerva over the other nearby indian_buffets is that they allow the lunch buffet to be carried out in a to go box and cup and it's slightly cheaper while being of the same or better quality
the only downside to this place is there isn't much seating
of us had a very nice dinner at minerva on a busy saturday_night
we had recently read the review in the isthmus and decided_to_give the restaurant a try
indian food is one of our favorites
took about minutes to get us seated and menus were handed to us promptly
for the next to minutes we went over the hundred ninety three items on the menu
each of us had a favorite item in mind even before we sat_down
our waiter was an authentic indian who knew the food very well
unfortunately it was difficult to understand exactly all of his comments but his enthusiasm and humor overcame any of those shortcomings
we loved the experience and would like to go back
highly_recommended
i am going to come right out and admit that i'm not an_expert_on_indian food
i infrequently visit indian_restaurants and the totality of my indian cooking experience is baking a couple batches of naan_bread and cobbling together a presentable chicken_tikka marsla
so if_you_are_looking for the definitive review on the authenticity of the cuisine served at minerva
this is not that review
with that said
i felt my lunch buffet experience was a ok
i thought the quality of the food was above_average by buffet standards
the staff members were hard working and extremely cordial
things i liked
the
lunch buffet offers an abundance of options
it took three trips to the buffet to sample everything
including the desserts
the lamb_curry
the chicken_tikka_marsala and aloo_gobi were standouts for me
the staff was constantly replenishing the buffet trays
so the food in the buffet stayed fresh
it helped that the restaurant was at capacity for lunch service
loved the caramel custard dessert that dish alone has me jonesing for a return_visit
there always was a staff member near to the buffet to answer questions and to offer suggestions for dishes to try
the servers were extremely diligent about keeping beverage glasses filled and clearing dirty dishes
things i didn't
the naan_bread was a let down it was too dry for my liking
i also did not care for the watered_down coconut soup
the spartan interior of the restaurant is nothing_to_write_home_about
as corey d mentioned in his review
it definitely will not transport you across the ocean to india
in addition
the buffet is wedged into an alcove and it was difficult to maneuver through the other diners
sitting near the front door during polar vortex season subjects you a cold breeze every time someone walks through the front door
for a cuisine known for its extensive use of spices
i thought the buffet food was timidly seasoned
it can be hard to understand the servers
other observations and ramblings
there was a line to get a table by
so come early to hit up the buffet
why is an indian restaurant named after the roman goddess of wisdom
is it just me that wonders about things like that
i never write reviews
but this was one of the worst restaurants i've ever been to
i got the shits from their food
i didn't even get sick when eating street_food in india says something about minerva's cleanliness
over priced portions
my bagara baingan contained only tiny
slices of eggplant
the rest
sauce
i've had much better value in nyc indian_restaurants
our waiter and waitress both needed to be reminded several times about our order
they seemed very disorganized
completely forgot items
chai
naan
dosa
and a main_dish
bringing chai minutes before we got the check
and the naan after we packed the doggy bag containers
waitress was also pressuring me to buy alcohol
dosa and naan were soggy and extremely greasy like dripping grease
they also forgot the crucial chutneys to go with idli
food quality and taste didn't make up for any of the negatives
won't even bother getting into specifics
we were very polite guests
and my dinner companion gave a large tip
despite the lousy service
really wish that he hadn't
getting sick from the dinner tipped me over the edge and inspired me to write
i really love indian food
and know that it takes a lot of care and skill to prepare
i always have a positive bias toward indian places
and give lots of leeway if the owners are tackling foods from multiple regional cuisines
i felt that both their northern and southern dishes were executed poorly
taste aside
on account of service alone
this place deserves one star in my eyes
avoid this place
i'm sure you can find better
p
s
why'd they name the restaurant after a roman goddess
star because it is the only restaurant that offers really south_indian food in madison
it adds much diversity to madison's food scene
we tried dosa and uttapam
they are real
get a ghee dosa
it would be both a month opening and eye opening experience if you have never tried it before
fish_curry was a very memorable dish
we also tried things under the
chettinadu
category
good stuff
they have a incredibly long menu
it will take maybe visits to savor the full selection
for first few visits
i suggest sticking to things you can't find in other_indian_places in madtown
based_on our two dinner visits
both food and service is pretty good
i hope this new establishment on_the_west_side will thrive in the coming years
caution
the
hyderabadi dum chicken biriyani
is insanely spicy
i like spicy food in general and take on very spicy dishes
but this dish will be over the limit to most people
consult before you order
i first went to minerva a week after it opened
i have never gone to any indian restaurant ever again in madison
this is mostly a south_indian restaurant but their tandoori_chicken is better than any other punjabi owned restaurant in madison
though tandoori comes from mostly punjab area
their south_indian menu is huge and bigger than any you will find in india
all the meals i have had from them is authentic
dosas so many varieties
all exceptional
medhu vada needs improvement
biryani try hyderabadi dum_biryani
chicken_biryani
amazing
all there curries i have liked
for some reason not a big_fan of the indochinese stuff as personally i do not like sweet in my food
but thats me
their kala chana is good
garbanzo bean
ask it with some bhatura
not on the menu
but they will make it for you
aka indian chhole bhatoore
really authentic
buffet is good
good selection
and tasty
because of place being small
they don't have many waiters
and usually waiters serve the entire clients so service may be slow
but i never mind it
as the food makes_up_for_it
their nihari is not authentic
in the pakistani british cuisine section
as authentic needs to be cooked for hrs or more
plus this restaurant is not pakistani so don't expect authentic nihari
go for the dosas
biryani
chicken curry
etc
fish molly was alright
i have lived in kerala and have had the best fish mollys so not a big_fan here
that said
this place is wayyyyyy better than taste_of_india
taj
dhaba
swagat
maharaja for authenticity
not ideal for a first date because of ambiance and service and noise level
but who goes to an indian restaurant for a date and come out smelling like biryani on their finger tips
btw i go there about times a week although i lie plus miles away
so good is this place
my husband and i tried minerva for the first time today
the food was outstanding
as often as we eat indian_cuisine
i am not good at describing most dishes by name
what i can tell you is that the selections on the buffet were fresh
hot and deliciously seasoned
plus
there were several offerings on the buffet that i've never tried elsewhere
it was nice to try something new
the tandoori_chicken was especially moist and meaty
not at all dry
the spices in every dish were just right
the only thing i found missing from the condiment section was the salty mixed relish that i enjoy on the side
this is a smaller sized restaurant
and it was nice not to have to stand in a line to fill my plate
despite the smaller dining_room
the size of the buffet and number of dishes offered was equivalent to both the larger indian_buffets we frequent
if you are a fan of indian_buffets
you will be very pleased by the quality and selection
indian food is spreading like wildfire
of late
for me
that's a darn good thing
last night's food was right on the top of the list along with dhaba
my sweet pakistani beau showed_up at my house with takeout
i was cold and tired from walking outside getting ready for a k
putting me and k in the same sentence is crazy
anyway
the food from minerva was just what the doctor ordered
we ate the hyderabadi dum chicken biriyani and the fish_curry
i loved both dishes equally
the heat_level was
medium
which for me was perfect
the rice in the biryani was lovely and perfectly prepared
each grain stood alone
the chicken was on the bone
tender and plentiful
the fish was excellent
not overcooked and really enhanced by the curry_sauce
we had both plain and garlic_naan
they were fluffy and tender even after reheating
we dipped the bread in the curry_sauce not leaving behind even one drop
the servings sizes were generous and today i revisited the biriyani for lunch
glad i didn't have to share that last portion
simply the best south_indian food in madison so far
their pongal vada is to absolutely die for
just_the_right_amount_of dal
ghee and cashews
and their dosas wow
they have over a dozen varieties all scrumptious
i also like their madurai idli spiced and fried goodness
their sambhar and coconut_chutney is also good
not really a fan of most of their other dishes though
i prefer the other indian_restaurants_in_town for north_indian food
so
this is quite complementary since i don't really like the others' south_indian fare
their service is decent and the owners are nice
not giving because their quantity to price ratio is a bit low understandable for an upstart
but hopefully they will fix it in due course
lunch buffet is delicious
its a small dining_room
but definitely the best indian place i've been to in madison
probably one of my favorite place sin madison so far
minerva is simply the best indian restaurant in the madison area
they offer an amazing lunch buffet
with a nice selection of both south and north_indian entrees
desserts
soups
and salad
their dinner menu also has many options to choose from
both vegetarian and non vegetarian
not only is the food as close to authentic as you'll find in madison
it's also very reasonably_priced
the wait_staff is polite and attentive and there is a parking_lot with ample free parking
whether you're a connoisseur of indian food or just trying it for the first time
you_won't_be_disappointed with minerva
ordered the chaat items
have had much better
the green chutney they add to chaat is the idli chuney
not meant for authentic chaat
havent tasted anything else
so cant comment
we tried different dishes
apps and entrees
and every_single one was delish
we're definitely going back soon
this is a no frills kind of place
so don't expect the most meticulous dinner service
go there for the amazing food
yummy yummy lunch buffet
and a great value at
there's about large buffet carts set up in the corner of the restaurant
and they offer a large variety of indian offerings
i think i tried just about everything and couldn't find one i didn't enjoy
their chicken_tikka_masala is so amazing
i probably could've had plates of just that and been happy
i also loved their chicken
i've never had anything like it before and it was delish
they also offer garlic and plain_naan
as well as a sampling of many different chutneys and sauces
wasn't too busy when i was there
i was one of about people dining in
but the server was constantly taking plates and refilling water glasses
i think i can say that i've had better indian food
but this place offers an awesome lunch buffet that i will_definitely_be_back to enjoy again
awesome and definitely my new favorite place
the only problem is it is on the wrong side of town
i've been trying out all of the indian restaurants_in_madison and the surrounding areas and stopped in for the lunch buffet at minerva after reading the other reviews on this site
i was extremely disappointed
i arrived around
the lunch buffet goes until
and everything i tried was cold and looked picked over
there was just a small amount of each of the vegetarian_dishes left so i tried a little bit of all of them
the food tasted fine
but i've definitely had much better indian food
i was hoping they might bring out some more food that would be hot
but the only food they brought out while i was there was rice
i will_not_be_returning
pretty good indian food
i have eaten here multiple_times
and each time the food was delicious
it's a small place but we will certainly going back
freshly opened where ann purna once was
bindi kitchen and cookery school is a mighty impressive new place
showcasing vegetarian street_food with a gujarati and east african influence
the extensive selection of dishes i tried were all excellent
with the spinach and aubergine curry the best among many wonderful items
i look_forward to my next visit
later this month
so overall
we said
bindi was an absolute revelation
rarely have my socks been so comprehensively knocked off by a place
each dish was outstandingly good
and the warm and knowledgeable service was truly joyful
i'd recommend you visit soon and you visit often
as this is a superb new addition to edinburgh's rich tapestry of restaurant excellence
the heady scent of incense filled the air in bindi as the yelpers gathered for their vegetarian indian thanksgiving
the chairs were squashy and high backed
arranged around a quirky t shaped table arrangement
among those of us seated next to the large and beautifully decorated plate glass window
there was a little shuffling and struggling to slip in and out
but the passing of plates and dishes to those least accessible made for a fun party game and added to the celebratory atmosphere of our gathering
tanya l had brought hand turkeys
and julie g
in addition to gobbles the turkey beanie baby
who served as our table mascot
had brought two big boxes with her containing pumpkin pie
the staff
far from being offended that we'd brought our own dessert
were more than happy to take them into the kitchen until they were needed
and even brought out a specially made pumpkin curry to add to our dinner
with two gluten_free diners among our number
the waitresses were also quick to go and check suitable dishes with the kitchen
clad as they were in stunning fitted dresses heavily laden with mirrors and detailed embroidery
it was a joy to see them float around the restaurant with giant smiles
it felt_like they loved being there as much as we did
i had a chat with one of the waitresses about the gorgeous outfit and she confessed she had been thrilled at the opportunity to wear it when she began working there
looking at the prices on the menu
i assumed that all the dishes would be tiny tapas like things
so i ordered two from the starter ish part of the menu
and a side on my main
knowing full well that julie g's pumpkin pie was still to come for dessert
big mistake
it's a wonder i could drag my bulk all the way home after a bunch of little square poppodums
some of claire l's delicious sweet potato crispy curls
three amazing batata vada
sort of fried spicy potato patties
a grated carrot salad the name of which i can't remember
a thali served in five silver dishes
and a royal raita of seasoned yoghurt topped with what i think was pomegranate seeds
and whenever i felt_like my mouth was on fire from all of the spices
perfectly balanced to create
not disguise
flavour
i took a sip of my passion fruit juice
yes
indeed
passion fruit juice
why does everywhere not serve passion fruit juice
i had two glasses of that stuff
and what did my bill come to for everything i ate
apart from the sweet potato curls i snaffled off claire and the delicious slice of julie's pie
i know
right
it took a bit of fiddling and faffing among us to sort out our bills individually at the counter but the staff remained helpful and cheery throughout the whole confusion
which ended the night with as much warmth and affection as with which it had begun
they're starting cookery classes here in january
if it'll teach me to make food even half as good as what i had last_night
i will be sorely tempted
tl
dr version of this review
go here
stars and deservedly so
quiet but friendly_staff and bindi herself is lovely
telling us about different dishes on offer
food was superb
i like eating veggie anyway and don't mind missing meat so this place is vegetarian heaven
lots of little bites
shared platter type dishes and a thali choice of curries with rice and chapati's
being gluten_free i thought that i'd miss out on the chapati's but no
myself and jenny got gf versions which were lovely
the pumpkin curry made specially for our gang celebrating thanksgiving was so yummy
i did order too much food the chilli fries were lovely
as were jenny's casava chips
lovely
freshly cooked onion bhajis and poppadoms i was stuffed afterwards and felt guilty about leaving such yummy food
the attention to detail in the spice and combination of flavours was immense and blew me away i am hoping to go back soon
i was in work the following day and recommended it to a friend
vegetarian
who went that night
loved it and is already planning a return trip this week
drinks reasonable the sauvignon blanc was great value at per bottle and went lovely with the food i'd ordered and a bottle at is very good value as glasses are
i tried some of cressi's passionfruit juice which was gorgeous too so if you are avoiding booze then try this
great little place
amazing food and service and such great value
being gf
don't let the menu fool you as some of it looks quite wheat based as it is based_on street_food many dishes can be adapted to suit such is bindi's knowledge of dietary requirements
this new indian restaurant has brought someone
once again
new to the edinburgh indian dining scene
vegetarian indian street_food
at very affordable prices
not to mention the lovely
relaxed restaurant itself
and the very lovely staff
with the beautiful saris and bindis
i came here with a larger group of yelpers for a delightful
delicious meal
first off
their chai mulled wine is delicous
for a glass
it comes in a small glass
so it means if you order three it's totally just the same as one big glass
and the same price too
the menu is quite like a tapas offering
lots of small dishes that can be ordered as starters
or a few together as a main
i took the special mango starter
and some chips
and the thali for main
for the thali
at dinner time
not a lunchtime special
yes indeed
it is all vegetarian
but i do think that indian food is the best cuisine for vegetarian food
and you wouldn't notice that there is no meat
all of it was delicious
beautifully spiced
each dish tasting distinctly different
handmade with love
this tastes like good
home made indian food like your mum would make
certainly not en masse bland creamy
red
'standard spice' indians that used to define a british indian carry_out
the lentil dish on the thali had a lovely texture
and the nuttiness of the lentils wasn't drowned out by spice
they even did gluten_free bread to go with the thali for claire and myself
that was a really nice
thoughtful touch
i will certainly be coming_back here
you can get a delicious
large feed at a very affordable price
possibly one of the best deals in the old town
and one of the most delicious
we ate here for our first thanksgiving in edinburgh
and what a memorable meal it was
i've never come across a restaurant quite like bindi before
the emphasis on vegetarian street_food means the menu is quite different from most indian_restaurants in the uk
we started with the bombay chowpatty taster
which was full of interesting things
the chaat was especially delicious
this was followed by a thali
which at was probably the best quality for price main_dish i've had in this city
the wine by the bottle was also delightfully well priced and drinkable
service was friendly
welcoming
and accommodating
if i have one little complaint
it is that my hair and clothes reeked of incense when i got home
and the next day
the smell of incense didn't bother me in the restaurant
but i prefer not to come home with lingering odors
but incense or not
i will very much look_forward to my next meal at bindi
out and about on a friday_night and looking for some where new to try and the missus remembered about bindi
taking over from anna purna's the owners have done a great job in giving the place a much needed face lift
on entering the restaurant we were greated by the very friendly patricia who showed us to our table
the restaurant has a comfortable feeling about it with a cobination of clean modern decor and traditional_indian in places
we both fancied a pint so we opted for the cobra which is the only draught available
there is quite a range of food options available here that neither of us had sampled before
also worth noting this is a vegetarian restauarnt
we opted for the nashto sampler to give us a good cross over of dishes
to accompany this we also opted for chilli cheese toast
a bombay version of cheese on toast
and vadhu pau
bombay's version of the 'chip butty'
who could resist descriptions like that
first up was the popadoms which were home made
as were each of the dips
the corriander and what appear to be methi was a favourite
the main_dishes were great with the chip buttie and the cheese on toast being my main favourites
the cheese on toast has a a bit of a punch and reminded_me_of bruschetta with chilli and veg
we had a chat with one of the owners and she said that the menu was based around food her and her sister like to eat but cannot find in edinburgh
i really enjoyed my experience here the food
service and setting were excellent
we had an amazing time at bindi on friday_night
and it was easily the best vegetarian indian food i've had in a long while
their selection of dishes is truly unique and the restaurant is a very welcome addition to edinburgh's already colourful indian scene
i'm already planning my next visit
d
this is probably going to read funny as i'm doing it chronologically rather than in any sensible order
so we're the first people to arrive at bindi on a friday_night
no one hears us entering so we stand around chatting loudly for a few minutes before going looking for someone
it didn't take long and an incredibly friendly and apologetic woman sat us down
the menu isn't standard indian_fare and neither of us had a clue what to order so we asked for advice
there are a pair of tastery things
an exotic one and a down to earth one
naturally we opted for the exotic one
believe me i was unprepared for what game next
the eldest of the ladies serving arrived with a selection of tasty looking things
one of which required a demo
this lady pour some liquid into a little deep_fried bowl thing and said 'quick quick
and popped the wee thing stright into my gub
quite unexpectedly materal i tell you
amused my friend no end
the starter platter thing consister of things
which i'll fail miserably to describe
see above deep_fried bowl thingy
so there was a crispy bowl with raw red onion and other things into which was pour a vinegar type liquid
some bahjii esque things
something that was a cross between cous cous and bombay mix with pomegranate in it
and little lumps of saut d african root vegetable
they were all delicious
although the last one was a bit chewy like it wasn't fresh
everything else though was wonderfully light and zingy and i'd have happily eaten another round of them straight away
for our mains we both had thali which i felt for a little small for a main on its own
it's daft cheap though so i clearly didn't order enough food
i had a desert of a sweetened yoghurt
some thing that was like a rice_pudding but made with vermicelli
according to the lovely lady who runs the place
and a semolina thing
incredibly delicately spiced
i had an almond milk shake with it too which was mmmmmmmmmm devine
overall wonderful free delicate tasty spicy food
very reasonable but small portions
i do have a pair of grievances however
firstly i ordered a diet coke and got a tiny glass for
it was clearly poured from a l bottle so i am rather irked by the stingyness of it
secondly our water jug had a big chip in it
a concern at a lack of attention to detail
that said they're just starting up so i'm sure there's some teething to be done
and i'll definitely go back because plain and simple the food is good
i came here a couple of weeks_ago for the first time
and treated my dad to an inexpensive lunch
everything on the menu is
euros
which really isn't bad for most items on the menu
the cafe is close to the university of edinburgh
making it a great spot for a quick student lunch
the interior is clean and spacious
there are plenty of places to sit
though it seems to be gaining popularity these days so booking is recommended
i opted for the thali
whilst my dad took the veggie burger
the thali was very spicy and tasty
though the portions were quite small
there were two small fried chapatas
two curry dishes
one was very interesting and memorable
fried chickpeas balls in a spicy gravy
a small portion of saffron rice
my dad's burger patty was also apparently very good and came with a selection of interesting spicy dips
the only thing that let it down was the quality of the bread
he said it felt_like it had been defrosted and would have preferred a fresher tasting roll
bindi herself was very friendly
and gave me a free shrikhand for pudding
a strained yogurt pudding spiced with cardamom and saffron
it was delicious
the table water came served with mint and cucumber inside
which was a nice_touch
overall
nice food but small portions
and the bread could be better
will be back though
the restaurant is clean and bright
the service was great and the concept is really interesting bombay east african fusion street_food
we had fried classics like onion_bhaji and batata vada as well as mogo
cassava
fries and turmeric hued fried_rice
the mango_lassi was not overly sweet
while the food was good and fresh
if mostly fried
i am only giving bindi stars because one of the dishes we ordered
chili paneer
that was labelled
gluten_free
was not really gluten_free
it had soy sauce in it
which does contain wheat
for celiacs
this is a problem and you should check with the waitstaff before ordering
the owner apologized for not knowing that soy sauce contained wheat
she was really lovely
but celiacs do double check on the ingredients in the food you are ordering
excellent new indian restaurant
great vegetarian food and delicious lamb
this restaurant is a welcome addition to monona
they also have lunch_buffets every day
we_will_definitely_be_back soon
this place is great
there are no indian_restaurants in the monona area and i am so glad they put this one here
the lunch buffet was delicious and the staff are attentive and genuinely want you to be enjoying the food
delicious
swad is a wonderful treat
my husband and i went there opening night and was amazed by the menu
not only is the dining_experience affordable
but the food was fantastic
i had the rogan_josh and the homemade mango_ice_cream
yum
i promise you will not be dissapointed
we were both quite pleased with this new restaurant in our neighborhood
i ordered the fish moly
a catfish cooked in a coconut based cream_sauce
it was mild
and very tasty
my parter ordered the chicken_tikka uthappam
a flat gluten_free pizza styled dish that came with both coconut and tomato chutnies and a delicious sambur
all for dipping
excellent meals
the nan was tender
the service and atmosphere great
we are happy to have a new favorite restaurant
we were both quite pleased with this new restaurant in our neighborhood

the nan was tender
the service and atmosphere great
we are happy to have a new favorite restaurant
so excited that this neighborhood has a fantastic indian restaurant
the food is great and the staff are so welcoming
even to kids
swad means tasty and it is
i highly_recommend the lunch buffet
not normally a fan of buffets
but they kept the food fresh and hot
the coconut soup was delicious as was the tandoori_chicken and homemade mango_ice_cream
several fo the dishes were milder than expected
but perhaps that in itself is to be expected
service was timely and attentive
simply the best indian food i've had since living in madison
as good as milwaukee indian_restaurants easily
we had the buffet on a saturday
the place was packed but we got a table right away
the staff is super friendly and really
really attentive
had a little of everything chicken_tikka_masala was dynamite
as was the shahi_paneer
chana_masala and the ghobi manchurian
let's just put it this way
the only thing i could recommend as an improvement over what i had was hotter onion chutney
it's really good
just not as hot as i'm used to
here's what else i tried
all amazing
mint_chutney
fresh hot naan brought to your table
included
and they'll bring you more
veggie biryani
goat_curry
chai_tea and kheer for dessert
plus the bonus
the place is really surprisingly lovely and charming given the strip_mall it's located in
yay for monona
wonderful
the tastes are very fresh and flavorful
i especially loved my appetizer
aloo_tikki chat and the curry chicken
can't_wait_to_go_back and eat more
amazing dinner
reasonable_prices
and so many vegetarian_options
i'm going back to try the lunch buffet soon
seriously the best indian i've had
it's cheap
a buffet
and the service is phenomenal
went there today after noticing it and fell in love
it's right near by and i was legitimately upset i didn't have more room in my stomach
absolutely going again very soon
had to check it out again a few weeks after my first experience
zowie
just as solid across the board
this time my year_old came along
she loved it
again
don't expect spice in the buffet
it's tame
but
order_off_the_menu for dinner or take out and they can heat it up
what i'm really enjoying is the staff and the owner's attentiveness
they're not perfect
but when the waiter forgot my chai he was very apologetic
brought it right out
and didn't charge me
loved the dahl
more vegetarian entries would be nice
everything quite tasty
nice setting
we went here for the lunch time buffet
the buffet tables are set up in the back of the dining_area in such a way that the line queues up pretty quickly yet moves very slowly
some of the dishes are harder to reach in the back left corner
the food itself is ok
the one stand out dish was the manchurian cauliflower
the staff demeanor is about the same as any of the other indian_restaurants around madison
not particularly friendly
but not downright rude either
i like the decor
dark red
black
and gold colors
and lots of wine bottles up behind the register
the day we were there they were having technical difficulties with their debit machine and were asking everyone to pay by check or cash
i think they have potential
they just have a few things to work out
yay for indian food in monona
lunch buffet highlights the catfish and the sesame chicken
hubby and brother joined me and i think each made three trips through the line
a variety_of_dishes
table served naan_bread and mango_ice_cream
of course buffet is the way to go
the space is new and clean
service quick and attentive
buffet diverse and fresh
we will return
the
best
indian
food
ever
period
great food
wonderful family atmosphere
good was hot and delicious
the extensive_menu had all the standards of a great indian restaurant
as well as a number of innovative items
and south_asian classics that i haven't had since i lived in india
the vegetarian dinner for two was enough food for three people
with a take out container to spare
we will be back innumerable times in the coming months
we plan in being regulars anytime we are in the madison area
the family owners are incredibly sweet
and the service was impeccable
it felt as if you were being treated to dinner in someone's home rather than at a restaurant
my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in madison
delicious
i went here recently with my husband and a friend because i had a hankering for indian food
atmosphere pretty nice
nicer than many indian_restaurants i've been in
while unassuming on the outside
it is actually quite nice on the inside
bonus the warm towels they give you after your meal smell amazing
wait_staff courteous and friendly
i feel like it took them a little while to take our food order after we ordered drinks
food the food here is quite good
i docked a little for two reasons
my husband ordered his food medium spicy but said it had little to no heat
my friend and husband both agreed it was pretty good but not the best indian they've had in town
my chicken_tikka dosa was excellent
so if you like dosas
i recommend it
overall impression i like this place and will likely be returning
it's nice to have an authentic indian restaurant in monona
went awhile ago
forgot to review
drinks
mango_lassi salted lassi
both yummy
appetizer
non vegetarian platter
combination of fish
chicken and shrimp pakoras lamb seekh
yum
and i don't generally like lamb
entrees
garlic_nan
and cheese nan
chicken curry
and fish_curry
the nan's were killer
the curries we ordered medium hot
and they came out mild
so we sent them back
we got
medium
back
and it was good spice_level
my chicken curry the meat was kinda gross
big hunks
kinda freaked me out
ate the sauce with the nan
and it was good
not a cheap place
but good food
the service was lavish and deferential
the entrees were wonderful
but the buffet kinda blew my socks off
everything was new to me
but fresh and delicious
lunch buffet is the way to go
lots of options
and only each
the lamb was the best thing on the buffet
the chutneys are all quite good
the ice_cream with exotic spices is excellent
the mango_ice_cream is yummy too
lunch buffet was a nice sampling of indian flavors
staff were friendly and kind
not a great name for a restaurant
but the food was tastier than other local indian options we've tried
nan was freshly_made
and hot off the grill
my husband and i have visited swad twice since_moving near by and it's very very good
we both love indian food
and so far swad has not disappointed
we began with an order of vegetable_samosas
they were very fresh
hot
and were very tasty
they had a good spice
but were not spicy
the first time we had them the tamarind_sauce was good it had a little body to it
more recently
it was a little watery
we also ordered chicken_tikka_masala
mixed_vegetable curry
and plain_naan
their tikka masala is a stand by for us
and theirs is very good huge hunks of white_meat chicken
creamy sauce
the first time we ordered it we asked for it the be between mild and medium
more recently
we asked for it to be prepared in the same way
but it was a good bit more spicy
we asked for the mixed_vegetable curry to be medium
both dishes ended_up having the same amount of heat which was a bit too much for me
next time
i'll ask for mild
at the same time
they are both good dishes
there are tons of vegetables in the curry
just thank god for the water
this place is becoming our to go place when we want indian
the
best
indian
in
town
we know the owner from going to the maharaja on_the_west_side
i'm so happy he opened a restaurant near where we live now
it's so good
there are a ton of choices for everyone and the samosas are quite tasty
the staff are friendly and courteous
the lunch buffet price is outstanding and the items featured in the buffet are quite delicious
i ate here last week with my adult son we both love indian_cuisine
while it was perfectly fine
i do not agree that it's the best_indian_food_in_town
the samosa chat was delicious
but both our meals and the naan were exceptionally greasy
as in leave a pool of grease in the bottom of the basket greasy
service was less attentive than hoped
although water was refilled regularly
at this price point
i didn't expect to have to box up my own food maybe that's why they give you the great smelling towels
this is the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
my husband and i crave their chicken_tikka_masala
we never seem to pass up the fish pakora either
delicious food and friendly customer_service make swad a very welcome addition to monona
probably the best_indian_food_i've_ever_had
with service to match
highly vegan friendly too
which makes my wife ecstatic
this restaurant may not look like much
situated as it is in the middle of a small strip_mall
but the interior is very nicely_decorated
i felt a little underdressed walking in mid road trip wearing a t shirt and shorts
but that was similar attire to the other patrons
my wife and i started our meal with complimentary papadam
which we were already prepared to order
they arrived promptly with several types of chutney
all vegan friendly no less
crisp
delicious and left us wanting more
but not because we hadn't had enough
they were just done perfectly
the rest of our meal consisted of steaming hot gobhi manchurian
bainghan bhartha
rice
chapati for my wife and garlic_nan for me
it all arrived at once
just as quickly as the papadam
the battered fried cauliflower was chewy but crisp
perfectly spiced
we went for hot on both dishes
and paired nicely with my garlic_nan
also excellent
it was the standout dish of the meal for me
the eggplant was excellent as well
with good roasted flavor
throughout the meal all the staff was very attentive
our waiter specifically asked if we were happy with the spice_level of our meal
our_water_glasses were rarely more than half empty
at the end of the meal one of the staff even brought over steaming hot lemon water sprayed towels to clean up with
by the end of the meal we were both nicely full
for a very reasonable_price
just an all around excellent experience
i only wish it had been closer to home
i ate at swad the other night and was a little underwhelmed
i tried their chicken_tikka
and it was fine
i think it was around for a pretty small portion
a friend ordered the goat_curry
and for about the same price had even worse luck
his meal was chock full of goat bones and very little meat
making it a terrible value
i've had better indian food in madison
and at a much more affordable price point
i'm really confused why dinner at swad costs so much
the portions aren't even that big
it's a nice
intimate space and the staff members were all very nice
but for my money
i'll stick with maharaja or taste_of_india
i love_this_place
have picked_up take out times and always been extremely happy with everything i order
top_notch service and food
our server was an absolute delight
will come here again when we're in the area
the food at om restaurant is pretty darn good
i've never had indian nepalese food so this was a very interesting experience for me
we came to this newly opened indian nepalese fast_food restaurant by accident
but once i entered the restaurant with my friends
we could smell the curry which made our mouths water
if you like spicy and flavorful food you are in luck
if not
then try their chicken momo's
which is nepalese dumplings
which is just awesome
a must try
my friends got hot spicy chicken_wings and i'll say they are sooooo good
one of the best wings i ever had
what a great find
i cannot wait to continue exploring their menu
the food here is fabulous
will definitely recommend
my son and i went here last week for lunch
it's great to have another indian nepalese option in this side of vegas
this is more of a fast_food establishment with adequate seating
good variety of both vegetarian and non vegetarian_dishes
the customer_service is great and they are willing to spice up the dishes upon request
we found some dishes a little mild for our taste but overall the price is relatively cheap and the quality is pretty good
nd visit
first time ate off the buffet and was decent
i was thinking if the food that's been sitting here all day is pretty good then i bet the items cooked to order must be great
sure enough was awesome
tandoori_chicken some of the best i've had
chicken chili good
wing good
asked i'll_definitely_be_back for tandori_chicken and try some veggie dishes
place if for sure legit
also prices_are_very_reasonable
def
check it out
good fast_food
limited vegetarian_dishes
but test is not bad at all
nan and pakoras are made right in front of you
as an indian
i am rather fussy about food from my country and while i will often put up with mediocre offerings
i am very pleased to report that the food here is very authentic and delicious
ethnic food seems to finally be making some firm inroads in the henderson eastern corridor
om is the latest addition
just south of serene you have to look for it
since it is set back a bit from the street
it is a relatively small restaurant with a definite take out setup and vibe
the food is all laid_out on a steam table and the menu choices are clearly displayed on big light boards behind_the_counter
the food is on display with matching photographs on the menu boards
the basic premise is very similar to panda express a side plus entrees
with entrees
sides offered are naan
white rice
pulao rice
and noodles
as with pe
you can select a half and half combo of two different sides
three of us ate there and between us we tried the chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo and chili_chicken which were all terrific
on the vegetarian side of the menu
we tasted the palak_paneer
aloo_gobi and the daal
i didn't have any of the veggies
but my friends gave them all a strong thumb's up
i expect to be back there frequently
both to eat there and for take out
oh my gosh
yuuum
we went here after work today and it was so delicious
all the food is prepped and if you want it spicier they will make it to order for you
garlic_naan is so good
they literally make the dough when you order it and cook it in an industrial tandoor right there for you to see
the food is delicious
the staff is super_nice and friendly
i ordered a entree plate with chicken_tikka_masala as both entree's which they were more than happy to do and basmati_rice for
this was an amazing deal
my girlfriend ordered lam vindaloo as both entree's and basmati_rice
you can choose rice or naan but you can also get an extra order of it on the side for
and its huge probably before being cut about the size of a small pizza plus its amazingly delicious
if you want quick
delicious
well priced indian_cuisine this is the place for you
we will definitely be coming_back here and i suggest you all go
wow
is this food amazing
no lie
try it out
it's some of the best india cuisine i have had and i travel all over the country
i can't_wait_to_come_back to have some more
i may even have it for lunch tomorrow before my flight back home
good food
especially for indian fast_food
better than any indian buffet at a fancy indian restaurant
i've tried a lot if indian places around town and i cook indian food and this place is yummy to me
holy shit
this place is good
ever wanted to eat at a place so much
that your butthole cries for mercy
get the naan
by far
this is the best naan i have ever had
i have to say that what's been missing from the entire las_vegas valley was indian fast_food
i was hoping this place would make the cut and i am glad to report that it does indeed
it's not the best indian food i've had but for fast_food and an amazing price
this place is absolutely stellar
must get the naan
it is the best i've had
walking in i felt_like i was back in california eating delicious cheap indian food
they have serving trays full of items but we stuck with our usual items to compare to other places in vegas
we ordered the chicken masala
lamb vindalo
cauliflower
samosas
garlic_naan
pakora
and kofta
the kofta was my favorite
i was really impressed how much flavor it had and it was made with chicken instead of ground beef
the lamb vindalo was my next favorite
the lamb was falling apart as i was putting it on my plate which was a great sign to see that it was actually slow cooked
the sauce was on point too
overall we had a great meal between the of us
left with a couple of to go containers and didn't spend a lot of money
i can't_wait_to_go_back and try other dishes that we missed
i was pleasantly_surprised at how good the food was
i would defiantly be back again
nice variety of foods
quick easy lunch
great prices and staff was extremely friendly
the food is amazing
i wish the owner all the best and give them my support and hope everyone_else in the neighborhood gives them a chance
its a small fast_food place and doesn't_look_like much
however the quality and flavor profile the family puts out is better than some of the the overpriced fine_dining places_in_town
they keep there overhead low to provide great prices to there customers
trust_me im a foodie and am highly impressed
go try it
nepalese indian restaurant and chaat house
halal
wholesome and delicious himalayan bites
owned and operated by a friendly
professional
and beautiful nepalese family
clean and casual dining
great location
next to the highway on i and eastern
will come again
and again
and again
inshallah
om
more like nom
haha err
i actually haven't had indian food since i've moved here there just aren't that many places and they aren't cheap like the bay_area so when i found a place in vegas that had curries for as little as
i couldn't pass it up
one could easily have a good meal here for around dollars an ounce serving of curry and a naan or some rice
and if you go for a groupon yelp amazon deal
you could have meals for for whole days
the amazon deal we used was a for deal and we got different curries
garlic_naan
and a mango_lassi and only paid about dollars on top of the deal we got
while the curries here aren't the most flavorful or original
they taste
to me
pretty authentic
the naan wasn't wrapped up in the best method they just kind of stuffed into one foil
but they still tasted very good anyway
the truth is if i could just keep eating
i'd probably stuff my face with naan and curry until i burst
but then this food wouldn't be so economical
this review is just from a take out perspective
i had a free voucher from lv local and used it trying om
i was pleasantly_surprised with the quality and flavor of the food
we order two combo entree's for
each and i ordered the aloo cauliflower
chicken curry
chili_chicken
and naan
the naan was naan bad
not bad
would have given them a star but not all the entrees were available for the combo meal and the portions were small
i guess i'm spoiled from panda express
anyways i will_definitely_return because it's close by and inexpensive for indian food
may give an update on review
hope this helps
i was surprised to see this fast_food type indian food place
the food was good and at first didn't think the portions were going to be enough but was full when finished
i would return again at some point
i prefer the buffet style indian_restaurants where you can choose your menu_items and go back if desired
tried this place using my groupon
i don't live in the area so i don't know if i will be able to use all my groupons
according to the lady
i can only use one at a time
the food here is very good
it's definitely a must try if you are in the area
for take out only
my employers have a weekly
food offering
where we have food brought in
to help raise money for a charity
i usually don't support this practice
especially since its every week
but today
there were two reasons why i tried the food they brought in from om
i'm a sucker for good indian food
and when the restaurant was announced
i
of course
read up on yelp and was impressed with the reviews
they were actually offering vegetarian_options
my employer has a very sad habit of offering vegetarians a ton of carbs
with no actual veggie offerings
i'm not a vegetarian
myself
but in support of this option
i opted to try the veggie_korma
and the aloo_gobi
wow
the food was so flavorful
i only had a few minutes to eat on my break
but i absolutely inhaled this
i can't wait to actually go the restaurant tot ry out the samosas
and the lamb_vindaloo
great first impression
om
well done
my favorite in las_vegas has been mint for last years
i have tried many of the other popular indian_restaurants and none of them have come closer to mint
until last month
one of my friend recommended this location to me and said that food is cooked in front of you and the prices_are_reasonable
i bookmarked this location on yelp and i finally went for it one day
its located on a plaza by and eastern
this area is always busy with many restaurants in the location
so parking might be a small issue
the restaurant is not lavish like many other indian_restaurants
they have tv where some indian music is played but over all its atmosphere is more like roberto's
the owners are nepalese
and the food is mainly north_indian with some that have obvious nepalese fusion to it
i always get two curries
naan and basmati_rice at this location
so far i have tried chicken_tikka_masala
palak panner
spinach w cottage_cheese
my fav
chilli chicken
chicken karai
and their garlic_naan
i think this restaurant has the most authentic indian flavor of any restaurant and the food is cooked fresh in front of you
this prices are also very low compared to taj and mint
and its an excellent place for take out meals
when i first went to this restaurant
they were running a promotion of off the entire bill for only month of march
this made the deals even more special
i also saw that they do deliveries now
i highly_recommend that you stop by to try out their sampler plates
thali
which come with entrees and side dishes
they also have groupon and amazon living_social deals
overall
this is like the himalayan version of panda express
you get to pick a place with two or three meats and a side
the place is spartan and clean
you get to watch bollywood musicals on the tv
that's always a plus
the naan is perfectly_cooked
it is not hard like some places serve them
the sauce for the various meats were tasty
they were the right kind of spicy curry
the meat however was tough
it has been sitting out in the steamers for too long
i think
their deconstructed samosa was a bit of a mess
it doesn't taste like how a samosa should be
hearty with soft potatoey goodness
it is too sweet for one
maybe they should call it a sweet vegetable and potato plate instead
the mango_lassi was averagely refreshing
the chai was made the way i like to drink them
it was made hot
milky and full of spice
this place is really good and very fresh
i don't over eat like a would at a regular indian buffet
the employees are super friendly too
delicious food and great prices
i got the thali plate which includes entrees and a side for
i chose the chili_chicken and lamb_vindaloo for my entrees and the naan for my side
i like spicy food
and these entrees are both considered
medium hot
which is why i picked them
the dishes did have a little kick to them
more so the chili_chicken
but i would have preferred a little more heat
but looking past that
the flavors were spot on
the sauce for the lamb was extremely flavorful and great for soaking up with the naan
i also got a little taste from my friends' plates of the chicken_tikka_masala and chicken karahi
and i'd order them both in the future
like i said
my only gripe is the spiciness
since there aren't many dishes that are spicy here
i wish you could choose the spiciness level like many other indian_restaurants offer
oh well
as for the atmosphere of this place
it is very casual
just booths and mostly blank walls with the occasional random wall hanging
they clearly don't care about the decor
but i don't either as long as they continue to serve quality food
great little place
speedy food
fresh taste and the chicken momo's
aka dumpling
are really really tasty
highly_recommend this place if_you_are_looking for fast yummy indian food
i had a chance to try this place out and surprisingly
they offer momo's
now some of you might wonder what momo's are
so let_me_tell_you
they are delicious gifts from god
this is a nepali indian fusion offering amazing food for cheap
highly_recommended
you_won't_be_disappointed
went in today ordered the chicken_tikka and the puloa rice
the chicken_tikka was tasty but a little to dry for my taste
the rice was pretty good
the next time i go in i will order the lamb and some of the items on the pre made menu
otherwise can't complain food is cheap
place is clean
not to shabby
pretty good food for what's known as a fast_food_joint
much healthier than other fast_food alternatives
naan was good
get the garlic version
tikka masala was way good
i love indian food and the only indian restaurant i knew of was taj_palace around the corner
we have been going to island sushi for poke but decided to try out om restaurant next_door
prices are awesome
customer_service was awesome
was very satisfied with all the food
we loved the chicken biriyani and the tandori_chicken
they are a must try
will_be_coming_back soon
this place was my first indian_cuisine in las_vegas
i ordered the hot mango chicken and the lamb
the mango chicken was spicy just how i like it
the lamb was very flavorful
food overall was excellent
i thought the portion_size was a little smaller than what i am used to
living in america and all
but it was just enough
will_definitely_return
great place i've never had indian food before but i came here because a friend told me it's really good and i work near by i got butter chicks and hit mango chicken and basmati_rice and samosa
like a potato egg roll lol
they were all very good the mango chicken is really spicy though so be careful haha but i will be back for sure butter_chicken and the rice was my favorite
very simple place
i like that when i want indian food i can just come in order and it would be ready with in minutes the price is fantastic and the flavors are very tasty
it is also close to my house so thats a plus
it is very clean on the inside and the employees are very nice
i will be back to enjoy this great food
came in for a early dinner with the family
we ended_up with three smaller bowls of chicken and lamb and two nann bread
food was very good with the sauces really hitting the spot with the garlic nann
overall
lunch might be a better option as it appears much cheaper
spending bucks i would expect a bit more than three little bowls of sauce and meat
as the added steamed rice for another
bummed the total to bucks
a bit too expensive for what you get and where you eat it
would be surprised if they are around in months
i am giving this place a very generous star
as i was thinking it was about a
star
it is nearly a
overall
i really enjoy indian food and have had it in so many places around the world including delhi and bangalore
here is what i like
a
fast during lunch
most of the food in their special lunch menu is already prepared and kept warm
so getting your food is very fast
b
selection very simple and clear cut
all types of curry and spice_levels that you would want
c
the ambiance very utilitarian in decor
design and feeling
i don't mind it
but it is on the very inexpensive mode
unlike other restaurants
d
the food the most important aspect
i love lamb so we ordered the lamb_vindaloo
this is my second time ordering this dish
the first order time we came here
the lamb_vindaloo was very mild
this second time
i asked for it to be hotter and they said it naturally was going to be anyway
i do admit
the spice was just right and the lamb was very tasty
the chicken_tikka_masala was okay
not too inspiring we also had the alloo goobi and this was good
so three dishes between us two
the naan_bread is darn good
the food is generally pretty decent
e
service top_notch and will help you to order what you want
excellent service
f
why not star
i am not sure
is it the paper_plates
is it the fast foodiness style of the restaurant
is it the utilitarian feel or the fact that when i am there it is generally empty
not sure
the food here is good
the lamb i feel is awesome and i will_be_coming_back for sure
gk says
check it out
oh_yeah
the prices are fantastic for the lunch menu
food itself
for the most part
ok
however the dinner prices are ridiculous
i ordered the combo option with two curries and choice if rice naan
very small portions for almost bucks
the curries were quite good though
the chicken momos
seemed more like microwaved gyoza from whole foods than authentic momos
overall pretty disappointed
delicious
flavorful and a perfect blend_of_spices
the chicken biriyani is really tasty
so tasty
we had tikka masala
lamb_biryani and some samosas
everything tasted so fresh and delicious
we'll do this again
and again
first timers here and we were not disappointed
since we wanted to try different thing's on the menu we decided to try thali
choice of entrees and a side
for
for my entrees i got hot mango chicken
chili_chicken and naan for my side
my daughter got chicken_tikka malasa
veggie_korma and naan
food was fresh delicious
portion_size was just right and we were able to eat everything
we also got mango lassi's
they were so yummy refreshing
establishment is clean and service was great
we_will_definitely_be_back
ordered food for delivery
except for a bit of a wait everything was great
portions were perfect and everything showed_up warm
will definitely be ordering from them again
i would love to be able to rate this restaurant
however i have come by in two separate occasions and they have been closed during their business hours
if i'm going to go eat somewhere i prefer that their hours of operation be consistent
we were grabbing cigars next_door and decided to nosh where it was quick and convenient
they do thali plates until pm so we both decided to go with a entree
side combo
lamb_vindaloo had decent flavor
but it definitely needed more time stewing as some of the meat pieces were soft
but most were still chewy and needed time to break down
unfortunately
we both selected this and wish we differentiated a bit more
chicken_tikka_masala was decent in flavor
but it fell in the middle as far as tikkas i've had in the city go
it was all breast pieces which for some people is a big plus
paneer saag had a slightly pronounced tamarind like flavor
but i was digging the creamy texture of this and they were generous on the paneer pieces
we picked rice as our side and ordered a side dish of garlic_naan
large piece
cut in
which was crispy and well made
if you want some fast indian food
this is probably a good choice
i'm not from this part_of_town so i don't think it would be something i would drive across town for
i think for the price point of the two thali and drinks
i rather go to a indian lunch buffet for more selection
apparently they don't like to work on saturdays
i came here twice on saturdays and both times they posted a sign on the door closed
closed due to
family emergency
i would have forgiven the fact that i drove a half hour to check you guys out but now i read in your reviews that other people say you are doing this on a regular_basis
not cool
i ended_up going to kfc instead and had a horrible experience there
i just gave them a star_review too they earned it but i'm not about to let you off the hook either because if you honored what you said i would have never been in that situation
i would've much rather eaten here
i think
i will update this if i decide to give your restaurant another shot
i wanted to try and see if om was as good as people have been saying
however
i'm starting to feel like it's a sign to not waste my time since om obviously doesn't care about our business if they're not honoring their posted hours
who wants to drive all the way over and find out they are closed
very unprofessional
especially for a fairly new restaurant trying to establish their clientele
my advice to all
call first before you make a special trip out
i thought this was a restaurant
but apparently it's just a hobby
drove half an_hour out of my way to a sign saying they were closed
due to a family emergency
reading through other reviews
this is not an isolated incident and apparently happens with a fair amount of frequency
we don't live in a communist country
yet
no one is mandating your hours
if you can't keep your own business hours
you should probably change them to something you can commit to
if this were a one time thing
i'd be inclined to be sympathetic but clearly it isn't
new
but not new
we were here before
but it was a different place
still indian food
but apparently under new management
upon entering the first thing that was obvious was they were very busy and most of their customers were indian
that's a good sign
as with the previous place
the buffet still is very small
there were perhaps vegetarian items
and
regular
items
except that included the desserts
they didn't even ask if i wanted a menu
they just said to go to the buffet
i get the feeling they don't like people ordering off the menu
the food itself was good
the goat_curry you wouldn't know it was goat if it wasn't labeled
it could easily have been beef
but wasn't
for religious reasons
i suspect
the tikka was good also
and they had a rice dish that was very tasty
i think it was labeled as a mushroom rice
although i didn't notice any mushrooms
but it was very nice
they also had biryani
and it was good too
all in all
the food was good
they are a bit pricey
just under for the buffet
weekday lunch
and if i wanted a coke it would have been extra
though they did have the real sugar coke
when we were done paying the check was very inefficient
they don't bring it to the table
you go to the register and tell them how many buffets
and then
eventually
get your credit_card and run it
i'm not sure what was going on
but the group in front of me had a conversation with the register person
owner
that i couldn't understand
and it took a long time before he finally asked me how many buffets i needed to pay for
as i said
the food is pretty good
but for the price there are better indian places
because of the yelp scale i have to rate one
under
but it was just barely under
it seemed pricey to me for a simple lunch buffet
so driving down elliott i saw this place and decided to stop
we sat_down
and the guy was so nice and attentive
we shared the chicken_tikka_masala
it was sooooo delicious
the service was incredible
and wasn't to pricey
the spices were perfect
not too spicy
i will_definitely_be_back to try their buffet
have to say this is the best indian food we have had in arizona
service was incredible with a waiter who shared information on different dishes and their ingredients as well as a history of the foods
it is rare that you can eat out and have better food than home_cooked
prices were good considering the excellent quality of ingredients
so worth the visit
ask for james
he is amazing
i'm so happy to have found aachi
we have been so impressed not only with the quality of food we've had but also the service and company from all the people that work there
james is so nice and so knowledgeable about the food
i've also tried the buffet and is fantastic
great variety
price and the flavors
all dishes are incredible and vegetarian friendly
we will definitely make aachi our number one stop for south_indian food
we really enjoy eating there and we always feel very appreciated
weekday lunch buffet
hey hey
it's a new buffet
stopped in here for lunch today
joined by mike c
jackie c
the good
this place features a comfortable north facing dining_room with your choice of booth or table seating
there were food items all together
counting salad ingredients separately but not dressings and garnishes
plus hot indian tea
this is a good selection for an indian lunch buffet
we were brought dosas
which are a treat often reserved for dinner weekends at indian_restaurants
the staff_was_very_friendly and appreciative
yes
there were a few issues
they open at am but weren't ready to go for a few minutes more
the staff seemed disorganized for them having been open at least days now
i've dined at more than one much bigger buffet where i was their first customer ever and everything was perfect
china city in avondale on for example
with a item presentation and not a flaw to be found with the place
the same was true of lin's on baseline and china olive in sun city
much of the hot food here was out at near room temperature
this is not ok
even minutes_later the two soups
for example
were barely warm
speaking of soups
there should have been small melmac or china bowls for the soupy dishes
not styrofoam cups
china mugs for the tea would be more appropriate than styrofoam cups
too
the flavors of the foods were good
and the selection balanced
they just need to run a tighter ship
so for now it's stars and best wishes for aachi southindian kitchen
weekday lunch buffet
tried this place today just on a whim passing by
i'm not that much of an indian food fan but thought i'd try something different
and
i was quite impressed
i won't necessarily go back here on every visit to phoenix
but will go back again at sometime
my only gripe
they cut the chicken into chunks after cooking
this makes it difficult to eat without getting chunks of bone in_your_mouth and having to spit out
perhaps this is the traditional way though
it was at least tasty
been wanting_to_try this place since it showed_up on my yelp
finally stopped in last nite
so delicious i woke up craving it
the service was also spot on
they were very attentive and the price extremely reasonable
will for sure be back to try more vegetarian_dishes
if you need a high dose of spicy food then aachi is the spot
food is tasty to the last drop including the masala induced coconut_chutney and the onion thoku
a kind of chutney
ordered the gobi_manchurian at level not so spicy but the cauliflower was nice and crunchy
the chili paneer at level was spicy and the sauciness gave it the delicious taste
next ordered the mysore masala_dosa with extra_spicy chutney giving the deep dark red color
the sambar accompanied_by chutneys and the masala_dosa was a perfect combo to a perfect south_indian experience
lastly finished the day with some madras coffee though doesn't come in a steel tumbler the taste is impeccable and a great way to finish the meal
ambience is good and crowd grew stronger at about pm
definitely a must go place and something i hope i come back to again
can't wait for my aachi experience round
the food is fantastic
i have beem to the lunch buffet many times and love it
i just went for dinner for the first time
the food was woderful as usual and the service is prompt and freindly
however
they were very frugal with the yogurt_sauce and mint_chutney
because they do not offer a dinner thali and it's a bit pricey for what you get
i am less apt to return for dinner
it would be ideal if they had a dinner buffet
i will of course continue to visit the lunch buffet
great food
food option in lunch buffet was awesome
chicken suka masala with dosa and idli combination is super
various delicious dishes for the buffet
i go to indian_buffets often and i have to say aachi has more choices and better dishes than most
don't complain
the flavors here are bright
vibrant and yes spicy
like many new indian places they start out with great flavor
people complain and after a year or two they start serving the same mild mush as everywhere else
so please if you love good flavors and spice go here
otherwise find somewhere_else
this place as the name suggest has south_indian food
which for me means dosa's and a few new to me menu_items
we had a dosa filled with a spicy gobi
cauliflower
it was delicious and yes spicy
my one gripe is that for the soup and chutneys they just filled up some small bowls from the buffet line that was set out for lunch
we also had an eggplant curry dish that had a
tangy tamarind and peanut sauce
it was good but i could not taste the peanut
as for the ambiance it is decent
not much different from the last indian place that was here
tables booths cloth napkins and per dish for dinner and lunch is the obligatory buffet
it's always a gamble when you visit a restaurant on their opening night
luckily
there was no
walking away
knowing when to run
from me as haveli delivered
i'll be honest
this location has been haunted by former failed restaurants
fitch's
good times
kickshaw
jimmy's
and their gigantic footprint
in this case
the owners did the right thing and only used of the former space
service was pleasant and efficient
we ordered samosas for our appetizer and aloo mutter and goat_curry for our entrees
while the filling of the samosas was a little too heavy for my liking
the crust that encased it was great
both entrees were very solid
the flavors worked well with one another
i was particularly impressed with the goat_curry
in the past at other places
the meat can be a little too
goaty
here is was well flavored and fall apart tender
haveli also has a lunch time buffet that i am eager to try
still early in it's existence but if it continues to dish out great food
i think it will be around to stay
i went here to try the lunch buffet last saturday and was impressed
i have been a regular at maharaja for years
but i might now be an even bigger fan of this indian restaurant
the lunch buffet has a lot of great offerings
though the space around the buffet is crowded and could be opened up more
the buffet items were delicious
i had an amazing eggplant_dish
the tikki_masala was so good
even better than maharajas
and they give you a choice of regular nan or coconut nan
the coconut nan is out_of_this_world
their tandoori_chicken was nice and tender and not too dry
also an excellent dish
i also tried their rice_pudding and mango_lassi which were both excellent
i think being a newer restaurant there are a couple of kinks to be ironed out like making sure the buffet has enough plates and bowls available
the staff was friendly which we appreciated
maharaja upped their buffet prices on the weekend which i think was not their best move and not only is this place more affordable but i think has better food overall
i will be back
my wife and i went to their_lunch_buffet very recently
the food is good and the service is pretty sweet
not too outstanding wrt the food variety but the tastes would be super good considering the price
location is nice and it is a good fit for a work day lunch
new place in fitchburg and i must say i am pretty excited for it
we ordered the coconut naan with shrimp korma
i the the food was really good the only complaint was the shrimp dish seemed a little overpriced at
i would probably give the food and service stars but the price was just a little high off the menu
the lunch buffet said it was only
and that would be a steal if the rest of their food is as good
the buffet was open at night too but opted for the order_off_the_menu
they even said i could get carry_out buffet
pricing for the buffet seem much more reasonable
glad to have a seemingly good option for lunch in the fitchburg area
i will update after i try it
hopefully it's a four or five
awesome indian restaurant good spread for their_lunch_buffet tasty dishes glad do not need to drive all the way to madison now
i hate buffets but this is a solid star buffet
the buffet area was constant kept clean and food was brought our regularly
they offer mostly curry dishes which is a huge plus for me
it varies from chicken
to vegetarian to goat_curry dishes
they serve cheese and garlic_naan bread with the curries
everything was delish
i will say that i was turned off a bit by the chicken curries having dark and white_meat in it
of all the chicken curries i've had
they were cooked with white_meat only and being someone who only eat chicken_breast
it was a bit of a turn down
however
the sauce and rice were great and there were some chicken_breast pieces in the curries at least
we dinned in a sunday_afternoon where lunch buffet was served for
great price
for dinner
you can only order off of the menu
shockingly for a early sunday lunch
they had plenty of customers
wait_staff were very friendly and prompt
interesting note
my boyfriend and i noticed how similar the establishment was to dhaba indian_bistro out in middleton
we asked the server if there was a coincidence and come to find out
they are a sister restaurant of dhaba
that being said
if you like dhaba
you'll liked heveli
the big difference is dhaba doesn't have a buffet
while the buffet was good
i think is enjoy ordering off the menu instead
i will try that next time
i would recommend heveli's for anyone who loves curry
i will be back to dine in the future
we went for the lunch buffet
i am thrilled to have indian_cuisine close to work
and a reasonably_priced buffet
since we paid in cash
it was for people for buffet with water as drinks
i thought the chicken_tikka_masala was ok
everything else was wonderful
i am looking_forward to coming here again with my family for dinner
the food quality is good
prove is reasonable
and the location and building is very nice
the staff was friendly_and_helpful
no wait for a quick business lunch
if you're riding on the bike path
this is a great lunch stop for the price
all_you_can_eat and mango i've cream for dessert
since i enjoyed lunch
i took my husband and daughter for the buffet on sunday
all the staff were very kind to my daughter
and made_us_feel welcome to bring a year_old who does spontaneous song and dance
since it was father's day
several more young families were enjoying their buffet as well
i'm pretty sure they didn't charge us for a our kid we had drinks and adult buffet trips for
short of having a toy area
this place was very kid friendly
we will be coming again
ordered an array of chaat and a pizza to share
had a chocolate croissant and samples of cake
don't be afraid to just order
only complaint is i need a translation to know what i am ordering but with everything tastes so good it really doesn't matter
not worth it
though the idea is appreciable
taste is not that good
its average or below average
people dont have options
and the shop is trying to fool it seems
samosa chat that we ordered was not upto the mark
mango mastani also tried but it was also not living upto its name
definitely not going to visit anymore the options that have on the list excites you but needless_to_say it disappears when you taste it
very nice place
if you are a pastries fan then i would_definitely_recommend_this_place
lots of variety of pastries and chaat snacks
i have tried pav bhaji
samosa_chaat and chicken_tikka pizza
samosas
both big and irani
and puffs
everything was good only concern was samosa could_have_been_better
the service is kind off slow and we have to request for water all the time
the first time we visited this place
the food was really good
we ordered the chicken puff
egg puff and few pastries
the pastriess were really amazing and by far the best i have tasted in the us
now the not so good things
service is horrible
they dont even serve you water and you have to ask for it
in spite of asking the server forgot my water
not once but twice
service is extremely slow
the second time i went
the chicken puff was stale
when i informed the manager about it he was really not bothered
i will go again here only for the pastries
went to get takeout
they forgot to put my meal in the bag
when i discovered this later
they offered to replace and refund
so kudos for that
but
the cake was flavorless
pros
samosas had a good flavor
seemed to be possible homemade
meal had good flavor too
will give them another chance
went this afternoon with family
place is still new and they still seem to be figuring out the operational stuff in the meanwhile expect quite a bit of chaos
possibly spoilt food and confusing service
we ordered paav bhaaji
sev puri and paani puri
paav bhaaji was ok and paani puri potatoes were spoilt
ok
have to leave now
the fire alarm just went off accidentally and chaos rules
in the meanwhile i get off as an apology for the rotten potatoes in the paani puri
doubt this place will be around in months and will not miss it either
this place is new and good
pizza and puffs are delicious
they don't serve pani puri which is one drawback compared to little india
overall its a nice chaat place and the cakes are very good too
i made nd visit to it and must say it was satisfying this time
ordered paneer_tikka pizza and mango pastry
must admit both orders were delicious
all in all this is a new setup and the owner is open to recommendations and suggestions
they need support to serve the valley
pizzas and pastries are a must if you visit this place
this is an amazing place for an evening tea and snacks
my and my better half come here quite often
almost every week
its a fun little place and the guys there are very customer friendly
not to mention
the place is very clean n tidy
ok now coming to the food
the chaats are delicious
helps us from missing home too much
good tea and vada paav
pastries are indian style which you cannot find anywhere_else in phoenix

the food is always fresh no matter the time of day or night
you must ask for garry when you go in
he'll treat you like family
even better
good food
i assume it's quite authentic
since many indians were eating here
right next to fun hog ranch on twain
the food was delicious
the service was mediocre
when we asked for a corona they asked
us to go order it at their bar
we thought that was strange
they messed up on our bills as well
i got a free_mango_lassi upon checking in with yelp
however they didn't have any
they did give me a
sweet lassi
which was good also
definitely would come back
yummiest indian food i've found in vegas
plan ahead and look for a deal on yelp
living_social
or groupon
and if you don't find on
go anyway
it's worth full price too
absolutely the worst indian food i have ever tasted
no_idea_what the other reviews are talking_about
when ever u goto india_palace
ask for manny as your server

they have good food and manny makes you feel like home
because he is very funny

best_indian_food_in_town
great variety
lunch buffet
perfect after race food
extremely bland indian food masquerading as 'medium' spicy food with fancy names
definitely a place to be avoided especially for someone with an indian palate
rude manager who didn't agree to obvious mistakes and things like a missing dish
yummy dinner with mum
bro az n sherry
try one of the samplers with a friend
well worth it
my fav indian_restaurant_in_vegas hands_down
food took minutes to get here
hmmmmmm dunno why
chef strike maybe
great food

close to campus
great dosas and gluten_free options
the best service of all the indian_restaurants i've been to around the us
lunch buffet till p
oh_yeah buffet
alcoholic lassi
sooo good
they have gluten_free items foods and drinks
one of the few places where you can still get an authentic multilayered whole_wheat paratha made on the tawa
indian girdle saucepan
as it should be and not in the tandoor
indian oven
makes all the difference in the taste
oh yah once again
yumm
slow service tonight kinda dissappointed for our first time being here
we'll see how the food goes
best_indian_food_in_vegas
i've lived in vegas for years

amazing service
great food
enjoyed the lamb briyani
awesome nirvana
feels like heaven
buffet with excellent cuisine and attentive service for naan and water refills
service sucks during lunch
i mean i am not here for free lunch
they should say no to customers if can not handle the load
you are on your own once at the buffett bar
might have to fight for food
wait hours for spoon or plate
dirty cutlery
seriously a mess
tip
bring_your_own plates and bowls from home
there are high chances you might stand in queue for hours
just because there are no plates
over with my food
no water yet
tip
no tips for the waiters
best indian food
great ambience
quick and friendly service
ill definitely be back
cant wait to have their tika_masala and tandori
really good lunch buffet
mali kofta
samosa chaad

it's always a treat to come here
i think the best indian_restaurant_in_vegas
crazy good garlic_naan
come early
we had an
pm reservation and are still waiting after
parking is hard as it is a small shopping_center
the food smells amazing and they have many imported beers
now has outdoor seating

ever
very good lunch indian buffet and reasonably_priced
if you are not not entirely familiar_with_indian_food as we were
try the tasting menu
excellent variety and delicious
we were especially pleased with the extensive wine beer cocktail menu
we will bring the kiddo next time as there is a great kiddie menu which are not available at too many indian_restaurants
kid menu aside
ambiance is quite nice
the inferno wall of fame
maybe we will do that sometime
wow
orgasmic
and a great value
very recommendable for inexpensive indian buffet
nice set up too
great place for vegetarians
very busy
make reservations
you cannot order from the regular menu during buffet hrs
does not apply to alcohol
it was just perfect
nice indian food an selection of rum lassi
yum_yum korma and massala
there isn't much parking space

so much food
everything is awesome
buffet lunch with the vegetarian preceptor
masala_dosa all the way
the food is awesome
really what i expected
nice ambiance too
pure tip
fancy adventure but unsure about what indian food to try
try everything at the
buffet
your sure to fine something you'll like
oh_yeah
keep the water flowing
they don't make reservations for lunch
come early because they do get packed
strictly buffet
they do not do a la_carte
for the price and quality of food you won't find a cheaper indian buffet
two people ate under
excellent
menu is small for buffet but more than enough
taste is ok as well
you know your food is spicy when an entire restaurant is coughing as your food is delivered
vegan an actual inferno waiver for the epic level of spice
delicious
i wouldn't recommend any to go
the qty is unbelievably small
tons of gluten and dairy free options
everything is clearly labeled
no going hungry today
one of the worst eating experiences of my life
water tastes horrible oranges fermented chicken was chewy
no flavor naan came late
food organized haphazardly as desserts just mixed into middle of buffet no thought to order or flow
horrible dining_experience
liked eating on the corningware dishes
not
trying out the lunch buffet
ask for ron he is a great deal of help especially if you're not familiar with india food
great food
great service
what's not to love
ron is the best server ever
he walks you through the menu and is so friendly_and_helpful
the mango masala is to die for
although they say its a bistro
aww yes it's quaint
comfortable and they are very personable
looks authentically nice
the surroundings and ambience can give u a quick d j vu of india if uv been there lol
cravin curry
love_this_place
come for the ayce lunch buffet
ends at pm
amazing selection
it's a great deal
don't forget a mango_lassi to drink or chai masala if you want something hot
the buffet rocks and try a mango_lassi while you are here
come hungry and dint be afraid to ask the guys any questions
the staff is super friendly
my favorite place to eat as always ron gives wonderful customer_service
the mango masala without nuts due to allergy
the buffet is from mostly vegan_options and is really great deal for the price
love the indian buffet
but especially the saffron cauliflower and mango pudding
best indian food and great beer_selection
always come here when in vegas
amazing food and beer_selection
we always come here when in vegas
great vegetarian_options and the menu has tons of authentic recipes
very wide_selection_of beers from around the world
love combining the yogurt with their chicken tandoori
their lamb_curry is delicious and not gamey
indian sampler for was enough for people
heats up well in the microwave too
oh my goodness
so good
it's been a long time since i've had indian food and this is marvelous
just_the_right_amount_of heat and a great selection for the lunch buffet
both vegetarians and carnivores will be satisfied
service is excellent
i'll_definitely_be_back
did i mention fresh garlic_naan
great indian food coming from a desi
overpriced and small quantity
best indian indian food in all of vegas if not anywhere
the best indian in vegas so far

small place with limited seating
it's right next to unlv
clean and friendly service too
bad customer_service here and people are super slow
overall bad experience
veggie pakora and paratha
great for vegans
the decor is great
waiting for the food
had haywards after a long time
hope the food reflects the yelp ratings

plus great service to boot
malai_kofta

excited
going where the indians go
away from the light distractions
best deal hands_down

saag_paneer fix
one of the best indian_restaurants in vegas
dinner time with my bangalore engineers
cheers
had a very good meal with chicken_tikka_masala

there is a menu for lunch_specials
but you may need to ask for it
a very cosy and comfy little restaurant in the middle of the dessert
good indian food
mostly recommended by the locals
they have a great lunch menu with combos at a great price
the tikka masala and the chicken curry is delicious
also try the aloo_tikki appetizer
excellent flavors
phenomenal
healthy
delicious
my first time here will not be my last
the people are wonderful here
papdi chat appetizer was excellent
the shrimp dish was fantastic too
the food was great
some day a bit pricey for the amount of food but i thought it was the perfect amount
americans are overfed anyway
as a vegetarian they had great options and use of no oil in any of their dishes
great experience
garlic_naan is amazing and raita

it was not dry given it was the end of the day
it was mega spicy which was great and the nan

that includes my favorites chicken_tikka_masala and tandoori_chicken
this is my new go to indian restaurant
i went with my whole family and we all ordered different dishes
all of which were phenomenal

the service was also excellent
very accommodating and nice
and
best of all
the prices and portions were superb
overall
an excellent experience
lovely place

the chicken_korma was better than i think i've ever had

if you are inexperienced in indian food get their dlls sampler plate

best buffet
from the outside you wouldn't give it a second thought
but prepare for some gr indian if you man up
the tip
get in early on the weekends
enjoy
thali specials are good for two
also the mango_lassi
i love indian food
doing the mango_lassi
i'm usually not a fan of buffets in general but their_lunch_buffet was surprisingly fresh and delicious
lunch buffet
yummy garlic_naan
just as fantastic as my last visit
chicken_tikka_masala was good
naan was not what i expected its to fluffy almost like a pita and you'll understand what i mean when you look around the open dining_area
not my favorite
lamb lamb lamb
don't judge a book by its cover or you will miss out on some really outstanding indian_cuisine
my husband liked it so much he wants to go back
the buffett is best as there are more choices for less than the price of one dinner not including rice
naan or dessert
excellent indian_cuisine paired with great service and reasonable_prices made for a fantastic evening
i had the paneer_pakora as an appetizer and the shai paneer for my entree and would recommend both heartily
the owner was super_nice and very attentive but not intrusive
i'd happily go to this restaurant the next_time_i'm_in_vegas
chicken_tiki_masala was amazing today
yummmmmm
service can be extremely sloooooow
appetizers are only ok
the only redeeming factor are their entrees
dive into this incredible buffet bucks
star
my new favorite place to grab vegetarian indian_cuisine
the food is amazingly fresh and the service staff was very attentive
will_definitely_be_back again
this is the buffet too
i can only imagine how good the a la cart menu must be
very delicious food
reasonably_priced
the wine beer_list definitely needs to be thought out more
if you are dining after dark
park in a well lighted area
near the front door or take a cab
did not feel safe walking to my car
will do the lunch buffet next time
lamb_korma
chicken_tiki_masala
garlic_naan

am
when the buffet food is freshest
amazing food
friendly_staff and did i mention amazing food
service was good but the bufffet not so great
yum
buffet starts at pm and ends at pm
best indian food so far
the lunch buffet is a great deal at
garlic_naan was the best
must visit when in las_vegas
authentic_indian_food
the food wasn't as good as i expected
we found out from the waiter that the curry is made from powder
not what i expected
the cup of water i saw served was lined with dust on the rim
the waiters shouted back and forth
i could not have been in a more disgusting restaurant with a horrible experience
i would not recommend coming here
the lamb dish was excellent
mmmm
tandoori_chicken
bring your appetite
delicious tandoori
chicken momo appetizer is the best
awesome indian
excellent value
nice people
absolutely the best
best best best
this place was crowded
the food was good but organization and the way the refilled the buffet is a mess
this is my fourth time eating here
i decided to come here for my birthday with my family
we had a great time
the service was awesome
food was delicious
mango_lassi was delicious
and the ambiance was quaint
i really like this place
well return again soon
food was great
service was awesome
well return soon
the best buffet
i particularly like the yellow dal tadka
the roti here
samosa_chaat
chicken kadhai
they are really really good here
definitely my favorite indian place in town
come early
meats are separated from other foods
if you are vegetarian its a spicy selection
if looking for goat and chicken it is cooked well done
for certain it's not the same quality indian buffet
it favors more to the vegetarian
spicier than normal
naan is thick and primitive
tandoori_chicken thighs are dry and goat stew is boney vertebrae
it's simple
this is the best_indian_food_in_vegas
ml taj_mahal beer goes great with vindaloo
best indian_buffet_in_town
awesome place
the owners are nice people
cool palace in vegas for spicy
flavorful food
no lines like other vegas buffets
delicious
great food and service
come for lunch
person
it ends at pm and it's a great deal
you have to ask for the naan
it's not usually out on the buffet
ask for garlic_naan
very pleasant atmosphere and servers
the chicken_tiki_masala is delicious and the servers were so nice
in hawaiian maeketplace
don't rely on yelp_reviews
i didn't like the lunch buffet and there is no option to order ala_carte
the baskets that contained the naan and the papadum looked like they have never been cleaned
the employee parking_lot is now in the non existent drive thru
if you want food_court tasting indian food mt_everest is your place
ayce lunch buffet from am pm everyday
they no longer offer garlic_naan in the buffet deal just regular plain_naan
x
naan is yummy
closed for good
no morning curry for me
thank you
closed
it's completely empty
great for an impromtu business meeting and the parkings great
lunch buffet with groupon now

closed permanently
this is a great place for vegetarians an vegans

hole_in_the_wall places with good food are what i'm all about
wow

best butter_chicken everrr
owner is cool peeps very informative

you can't see either from the road so look for las palmas which is on a sign for the mall
came here for our nd anniversary dinner tonight
it was excellent
tonight the lamb_korma
shrimp biryani and kasmir naan were excellent
fave indian in las_vegas
try their samosa and biryani
chicken_korma is delicious
super horrible indian restaurant to visit in vegas
the food is too pricy
the lady over there was too harsh and service was pathetic
i would never recommend_this_place
super friendly owner
very good food
will be closing sunday the th
last chance
closing at the end of the week
love this indian buffet in vegas
a must stop for me when in town
deeeelicious food and pleasant staff

we love the green chutney on everything
summer hours in effect
i believe it was
during the week
oh

now a few bucks
thank goodness for groupon to make this place reasonable
for a pretty small chicken_tika makes me feel violated
be careful of how spicy you request

problem with these indian_restaurants is that they cater an event one evening and save the food for the buffet the next day
very bad practices that should be investigated by health and safety officials

the lunch buffet with fresh naan is amazing
awesome food and service love_this_place
i am disappointed with this place
seeing all the reviews i was expecting a very good lunch buffet
but the buffet was bad and expensive
the food was amazing
especially the butter_chicken and garlic_nan
try the mango_lassi
i was sad to see it end
came on and they look to be out of business
such a shame
closed
noo
why did they close
i didn't even get a last dine before they shut the doors
so sad
just opened
great place
yes
i was super skeptical being a pasand fan
but it came through
the lunch buffet is amazing
lots of options and fresh nan garlic_nan and masala_dosa with your meal
you_won't_be_disappointed
awesome food
must try
hhshs
first indian_cuisine with no poori
mysore masala_dosa for spice fans
unbelievably good food
nice selection
hot enough that you know this is not american cuisine
and a very fair price
plus
newly remodeled
wish they were closer to my house
maybe i'll move
mango_lassi
plus some hariyali kofta curry
only been there this once but the food and the people that we met there were awsome
good so far
buttered spicy chicken and dosas
lunch buffet
sodas
the tikka masala is wonderful and we are addicted to the vindaloo too
def get extra rice
love it
best ever
swear to it
actually just left but worth noting how amazing the food was
awesome tikka_marsala and the vindaloo is to die for
great variety
not exactly authentic
but very close
if you want something that's a little more complex in spices you should come here
great buffet
good varieties of indian food during lunch buffet
they have buffet only for lunch on the weekends
order from the menu for dinner only
good buffet but desert is not fresh
delicious appetizers
gave it another chance but was very disappointed
awesome sunday buffet
my quest for a good indian food in phoenix area finally ends at chutneys
very bad service
bombness
try the lamb stuffed naan
chicken masala and saag_paneer was deelish
been to this place times now and i am hooked
we get the chicken_tikka_masala every time and try something new each time
the friday chef special
goat
is fabulous and the garlic_naan is a must
never had a bad dish
do no go here without getting the garlic_naan
lunch_specials tuesday friday
am
pm
outdoor patio area with a fire pit perfect for a spring or fall evening
i totally suggest trying the tandoori wings appetizer
they are so good that i daydream about them
star food
this one is open on mondays
the bell road location is closed
this is not a buffet like most posts suggest
the chicken_tika_masala and garlic nam bread is fabulous
great food
less expensive too
dosa methu vada what a treat
first time
plain rice comes with the entrees
so keep that in mind when also ordering biryani
awesome
totally refreshing mango_lassi
lamb dum_biryani is great
as is their chicken_tikka_masala
can't_wait_to_try even more dishes
closed tuesdays for lunch
head to nearby tadka sizzles if you forgot
the chicken_biryani is a plus
service
ambience and cleanliness is a minus
carry_out is recommended
just try something new
today again i had muttton biryani and my friend had chicken_biryani both were worse
chicken_biryani is awesomely spicy
food is good
i usually take chicken dum_biryani which is really good
the best chicken dum_biryani in phoenix
yummmmmmy tomato_soup
don't be turned off if the parking_lot is empty
we trusted the yelp_reviews and we're glad_we_did
they have a nice buffet of non spicy items
can't go with ordering garlic_naan
best indian buffet i have found in phoenix
india buffet ftw
nice place
but need improvement in nahari
fancy decor
very attentive service
yummy food
careful
their level spice is not for wimps
ask for their yogurt_sauce if needed
very tasty
best indian in town
chicken_tikka_masala is incredible
yet another meal where i'm crying sweating
but don't care
vindaloo
masala garlic_naan amazing
chicken_tikka_masala ohh yeah
appetizers are stupid
food was still ok
nothing special
typical indian restaurant like rest in vegas
just minting money for something they call food
good food
not a good place for an indian buffet
not so much food in the buffet area and it's too pricey for just a couple of dishes served
most of the food were dry when we got there
be prepared to wait longer than usual for the food to arrive
who goes to an indian restaurant to drink at the bar
south_indian food vadas
dosa uttapam
very fresh
well seasoned
great service
great service
really good food
we went for the lunch buffet
they had a different variety of indian food than i am used to which was great
but the food was mostly disappointing
we liked the naan
and the chicken_tikka_masala
most shockingly they had no desserts besides fruit
also ordered a mango_lassi which was not very good
it was too sour and mostly tasted like runny yogurt
free_mango_lassi with checkin
it was
when i walked in and they said they were closed
hours on the door say
merrrrr
not bad love chicken tandori
very good food and great service
they made special non garlic non onion food for my mom
dosa tuesdays
ayce dosas
masala
plain
mysore
andhra
paper and cheese
i was happy to see that right on the menu all items that are gluten_free are marked
it's a little confusing
but you will notice that all the vegetarian items are gluten_free
most of the speciality and grill items are gluten_free
but just two of the appetizers are gf
vege options were very good
meat options were ok
overall good
you have to try the chicken
free wifi the password is on the front counter
if you enjoy indian food
go here
i have been in vegas almost two months and it is the best i have found
honestly
it ranks up there with the best i have ever had
try chinese_food here
very good
they have improved a lot compared to opening week
nice ambiance and food quality is improving
they introduced kothu paratha and its good
lunch buffet is pretty awesome
came in at the end of the lunch buffet
there was not much left
asked if they would put out more chicken and they said something to the kitchen but never came back to us
the fish_curry looked questionable so we didn't try it
one of the curry's had tons of bits of bones in it
and the other curry's was just sauce left
we basically ate the different_types_of rices and grains then left
awesome buffet
spicier on the weekends
yum
food is good
the lunch buffet is a great way to get acquainted with fantastic indian food
best indian lunch buffet
come early for lunch
long queues at the buffet after pm
tip you server in cash
otherwise the money goes to the restaurant and not to your server
buffet is awesome and unlimited fresh dosa is too good
the recipes are spot on
light and flavorful
we ate dinner here and we will return
the service was excellent
the food excellent
and we know our indian food well
come here
those other reviews are dead wrong
they never came here to eat apparently
really good chicken_tikka_masala
great lunch buffett
love the lunch buffett
atmosphere was good
service was great
i think they overcharged us but one review said they charge extra for rice so maybe that was it
the food was not good
really upset my stomach
won't return
for two people to eat
kinda high considering the portion_sizes
lunch buffet
great food and wonderful buffet
pretty much place with dinner buffet
first time here looks super clean
and the guy behind_the_counter speaks good english
at the silverton
enjoying the asian food festival
it's ok
lots of food to choose from and
rides
i just think it is a little steep
you have to pay just to get in
short rib and kimchi bowl at truck norris
it's to expensive
to get in and that gets you nothing
it was supposed_to_be an asian festival but all they did was play rap music
really seriously
awesome banquet meal
each
wonderful dinner
flavorful dishes
spicy too
and very friendly service
terrible
avoid at all costs
loved the place
first time very impressed
we ordered the chicken_tikka the kudai vegetables
which had a nice kick and lots of flavor
pappadum
excellent
roti
very good
parathas
good
a little thin
our waiter did forget our roti raita
otherwise
service was excellent informed
if there is a buffet then no ordering off the menu
great food
zero ambiance
try the karaikudi chicken
it's great
everything is fresh which sets it apart from other indian food in the valley we have tried
great indian buffet and restaurant
i've tried the buffet for lunch and had dinner off the menu numerous times
great south_indian food
food was pretty great but for an entree i expected a bit more food
fantastic food
good service
come for the lunch buffet
lots of choices
some new to me
all well prepared
got take out and the food was very good
saturday_night walked in at
pm and door says closing time
pm
refused to take anymore customers
needless_to_say it's not worth_the_drive or groupon
bad business
go to indian paradise instead
oh no they have closed
they have a big downstairs movie room that would be perfect for group meet up
tandoori meat platter is seriously good
it's being your own wine and beer
not spirits or soft_drinks
bad food i never had before
good so far
delicious indian food and good service
try the buffet and don't forget to top it off with the chai_tea at the end
the good food was a good place to come visit the buffet was excellent service was great as well
loved it again
delicious lunch buffet
try the chicken saag
i think india_oven buffet is better and closer
delicious
garlic_naan and chicken_tikka_masala is to die for
their vegetable_korma and matar paneer are both superb
they have naan and dosso
sp
upon request
if you like spicy you need to ask for it here
the bar is decent but the patio is really nice
you should have a party here
very nice buffet don't assume the other table to be desserts only
asthere are lots of unnamed sauces and relishes
lunch buffet was a smokin deal and very tasty
their peas pilau is a great vegetarian dish
waiting for paneer roll nd noodles
it's been minutes already no food yet
zzzzz thinking of walking out
update
got the food in mins
it was good but it's really not worth waiting that long
stars
some truly authentic dishes of southern india that were fresh
interesting and very tasty
it took me straight back to my recent trip to india it was that tasty
try the masala chai
at the end of the meal
perfect way to finish your meal
off in march
such good value
lots of wheat free bread options too
they deliver within newington area and take card payment over the phone
the dosas are better to sit in than for takeaway delivery
they now have a liscence
the owners seem lovely and the menu looks so authentic
the best south_indian food food i've had in edinburgh
hands_down
try the fish pakora it's the best i've had with the two red sauces ask the waiters omg so
good
don't forget the buffet
do forget your waistline

love_this_place
bout your typical chinese
expect spice
decent food very spicy
service mediocre
get early
and have extra hot if you can handle it the indian way of chinese_food
loved the pan fried paneer and the hakka noodles
only the starters are delicious
main_course are not that good
n we had the mango martini
it was awful
all i can say is avoid it
disappointing
this is not real indian food
new concept and location
a lot faster and just as good
can't_wait_to_come_back
excellent wraps
love the quinoa with tofu and veggies
plenty of vegetarian and vegan_options as well
as for those who prefer a little critter in their dinner
lots of great vegetarian and vegan_options as well as chicken and beef for the meat
lovers in your life
never should have moved
closed the other location which i loved
this one is awful

masala sauce is a winner
bombay_spice aka bombotle

i hv the whole restaurant
to myself
i feel like beyonc
chicken chettinad is awesome
tasty indian comfort_food
simply delicious garlic_naan
service is still sketchy and
needs to improve to be stars
they need a transparent system of dropping off the bill at
the table vs paying at the counter
lovely selection of exciting little dishes
packed with flavour
delicious food
the menu is a little bit on the larger side
however the staff is very
friendly and more than happy to give suggestions and answer questions
lunch buffet was only
the best quality
i loved it
request the garlic_naan with your buffet
good buffet and much better options then other indian_buffets and more space
so fucking good
get the garlic_naan
the chili_chicken is scrumptious
mango_lassi with checkin
excellent lunch buffet
they had a good spread for vegetarians as well
the owner was nice
and came by the table many times to check on us
much better than other indian fares on
the strip similar taste but much better price and service
great lunch buffet
i would recommend_this_place_to_anyone
delicious buffet lunch reasonable_price

look for a
groupon for excellent deals on already reasonably_priced food
order the chicken_tikka_marsala and lamb_vindaloo a la_carte in large to save money for a
group
friendly and tasty food
the most disappointing indian food i've had to date
the curries are watery and lack any flavor
and the portion_sizes are almost comical
literally small bites of meat per entree
delicious and flavorful
thali plates available from
am to
pm

chicken
chicken milagu fry with parota and fish fry are the best
the best indian food in the area
first visit

atmosphere reasonable_prices buffet lunch was ono
there is a discount if you pay with cash
we tried the shrimp korma with the coconut naan

the coconut naan was fantastic

goat biryani
reheated rice w scarce meat
served in a medium soup bowl
not taureen or platter
potato cauli agloo in little dish the size of a butter tray

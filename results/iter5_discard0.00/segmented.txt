the_lunch_buffet from
to pm is crazy delicious
weekend_buffet is dollars a_person
try a_little_bit_of this and_that
take what_you_want
leave what_you don't
great_food
good_service
i_recently went_to their odana rd location on the_west_side for_dinner and_the_food_was still_very
very_good
but the_price_was nuts
so stick_with the_lunch_buffet_and you_will_have happy belly and_happy wallet
one_of a select few good places to_eat on_the far east side_of_town
i_mean come_on
between a_bunch_of chain restaurants flanking the mall and maharaja
there's no comparison
love lunch_buffet
and_you_can in_fact grab_a solid dinner as_well
perfect dinner_for_two
samosas
ginger naan
bainghan bartha
mashed grilled eggplant mmm
and_mango chicken_curry
the_service_is_very courteous for_dinner
they drop your napkin in_your lap and_you_get a_hot steaming towel after your_meal
extra points for_the extremely bass heavy hip hop gospel music coming through the_wall from now faith ministries next door
they_have one helluva sound system
if that's_not your sort of thing
then avoid typical church hours
excellent lunch_buffet
quick_service
love_this_place
their_lunch_buffet_is great
so is_their dinner_menu
my_partner and_i_went there_for_dinner on new years eve and_for valentines day
we_had so_much fun
it_is_a relaxed atmosphere and_they_have great_food
i_recommend_the tikki_masala
tired of
phone it_in
lunch_buffets
with the_same dishes day after day
then maharaja might get_you out_of your funk
i've_been_to their_lunch_buffet about times
and every_time there_is_a new dish or_two that_i've never seen before
great_price on_the_lunch
wonderful dessert selection
good_variety between meaty and veggie_dishes
love the_goat_curry
if_you_like_indian_food at_all
you can't_go_wrong_with a_lunch at maharaja
and_for facebookers
no
i_did_not eat times tonight
just catching up_on some restaurants_that deserve a_good review
the_buffet_is ok
but_i came_back for_dinner_and the specific items are_very_good
i_had_a vegetable_korma and_a chickpea_curry
samosas were_super
chutney could_have_been_a bit spicyer
but hotness on the_food_at medium was_quite_good
go here_for_dinner
yum
they_had as special
entrees
nan
rice_and popadom for
i_have drove past this_place_a thousand times
and_never realized it_was even here
i_didn't discover my deep and passionate love of nepalese_food until moving up_to_the twin cities
but over break my dearest mother suggested we_go_to the_maharaja on_the_east side
on_the_east side
i scoffed
foolishly
there_is nothing but chain food_and malls on_the_east side
i_know this statement fairly well
as_we grew up minutes east of the_east_side of madison
making a_trip downtown quite_a hike
but_she assured me that_it_was in_fact on_the_east side
and_not on_the_east side like
ella's deli is_on_the east_side
this thing_is on_the_east side as_in east towne mall is_on_the east_side
so
reluctantly
i_went_in
and_was greeted with awesome
this_buffet was_amazing
they_had_a coconut soup which_was great
all_of_the chicken_dishes were_great
they_had_a wide_variety_of veg_dishes
i_was_so stunned and amazed
even_though_i didn't partake
they_served strawberry lassi
mmm
finished off with_some mango_ice_cream
i_couldn't have_been more impressed
whenever_i visit home
i_always drag my_family along to maharaja
delicious
and_a good_price
all the_staff_are very_friendly too
this_is it_the cream of_the crop
i've_lived in_the madison area for the_past two_years
have visited many_of_the local indian_buffets
and have_found none that equal the_maharaja standard
buffet dishes change on_a daily basis
but_you_can always count on_their show stopping chicken_tikka_masala to_be in_the mix
in_addition_to the_standard meat curries and_tandoori_chicken
they_always offer multiple vegetarian_dishes_and an array_of appetizers
recommendations
coconut soup
vegetable_korma
malai_kofta
baingan bhartha
chicken_tikka_masala
mango_ice_cream
the_staff_is wonderful and_always keeps plates_of naan a plenty
maharaja is_by_far one_of madison's best restaurants
and
you_can't beat their_lunch_buffet deal
under
but diners beware
it_is incredibly easy_to overeat at_this_place
forcing one into an almost immediate food_coma upon settling the_check
this_place_had its awards placed up near_the entrance
so_they can_say they're awesome
but
these awards are outdated
remember one that_was dated back_in
no yet
ha
had the_tandoori_chicken_and the_lamb_curry
the_lamb_curry was_awesome
although_not enough lamb chunks
the_tandoori was_excellent_and spicy
had_a side order_of_naan too
delicious
but expect_to_pay a_good_amount
its quite good_and_the awards don't lie
the_staff here make the_experience
since_i am not_a_fan_of buffets
i_can_only tell you about the_meals here
delicious
i don't_eat meat
my_boyfriend almost only eats meat
we_both found things we_loved
it_was_the_best
we_liked to_eat_here once_a_week since_it_was so amazing
i'm_not usually a_fan_of buffets
but maharajah's lunch_buffet_was quite enjoyable
i_tried small amounts of_a variety_of_dishes and_sauces and_all were_tasty
their stuffed eggplant special_and goat_curry were_super
the_food seemed_to be recently made as it_was_not dried out or overcooked
sorry i_am indian and_as_a indian this_place blows
their aloo parathas are_a cop out_the just use samosa filling for_the stuffing
the_spicy pickles are from_a can
also their vegetable_curry is made_with frozen vegetables not fresh
also i_know its_not a authentic place_when the serve beef
no authentic place will_ever serve beef
they_will serve goat
lamb
chicken_and every animal except beef
what else
oh yea two_of the_servers started chewing each_other out_in the_back_of_the room where everyone could here
also they_should invest in making
chaat
food street_food of_india
they_had none_of that_one the_menu
i_will give_it star_because the_garlic_naan_was good
also our_waiter was_really_nice it_was some guy_who moved_here from sd
save your indian_food craving and head down_to chicago
i_am_not_sure what_i like for_indian_food but_this_was damn_good
pretty_good lunch_buffet
theres alot_of vegetarian choices if you stick_to a certain kind of diet like myself
i_eat only halal meat
i_haven't asked if any_of_the meat_on buffet_was halal only_because i_don't_want_to make_a fuss
i_will however call ahead_and see if_they_are serving any halal meat before_i decide to_dine for_dinner
sometimes they_have chicken_and goat but sometimes only goat
as far_as authenticity goes
i_can't personally say because i_am_not south_asian
that being_said
a_friend_of_mine who_is complains alot that_there_is no authentic south_asian restaurants_in_madison
this how ever does not_take away_from_the tastiness that_i_have experienced at maharaja
they_have satisfying dishes_that come_in satisfying portions
if you dare to_go_to_the spicy side_of_the spectrum they_are constantly filling your water
which_is awesome
you_don't want_to_be left without water when_the burn becomes too_much
you_can ask_for not so_spicy though
the_only not so_great thing i've ever_had here_was the_cheese pakora
they kind of seemed_like they_were pre made
as_in frozen
and_not fresh
that_was the_only_thing
ever
in_all_the times i've_been_to maharaja
both east and west locations have awesome service and_tasty main_dishes
you'll be treated like royalty at the_maharaja
i_first came upon this_place by chance
i_was_in town_for work and noticed that_there_was an_indian_restaurant nearby
after_reading_the great reviews_on_yelp
i_knew i_had_to_try it for_myself
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala along_with naan_bread_and a_cup_of chai
i_ordered the_food_to_be indian hot
the_waiter replied
i_like your confidence
it_was very_tasty_and hot just_as i_like_it
the_restaurant_was well kept
the_staff treat the guests as royalty so the_service_is wonderful
and_the_prices_are decent for_what you're getting
don't_forget_to stop_by the indian_grocery that is_located next_door_to this_location
it_has_a large_selection of_items so that_you_can make your_own indian_dinner at_home
will_i be_back the_next_time i'm in_town
absolutely
we_did takeout and_we ended_up_with large_portions of excellent chicken_tikka_masala
garlic_naan_and veggie pakora_and they_gave us free_chai for the_road
i_have_a new found love for_indian_food_and when_i found myself in_madison i_had_to check_this_place out
it_was most excellently delicious
the_staff_was_very nice and_the_price for_people including drinks_and an_appetizer was_about
if you ever find yourself on_the_east side_of madison
you_should really check_this_place out
the_food_here_is good
my_husband_and_i are new_to_indian_food
so i_can't_speak to its authenticity or how_good it_is_in comparison_to other indian_food
but_overall we_really liked_the_food here
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was particularly delicious
though there_were lots_of very_good options at_the_buffet
the_naan was_also_good
and needed_to cool the mouth every so often
the_service_was okay
nothing good_or bad to_say there
the_inside was_really not all_that awesome
that_was_the major part that brought down the_experience for_us
it_looked_like it could_do with_a face lift
the_decor_was ok
nothing_special but there_were_some odd mylar stars and_hot air balloons hanging from the_ceiling
came_in_for dinner and_there_are two other_tables at
on_a_thursday night
i_wonder if people go_to bed early around this neighborhood or_if this_place_just isn't_that popular
coconut soup_was weird
a_mix_of hot coconut milk that's been watered_down and_then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a_bag
this_was definitely_not fresh coconut in_any way and i_found_this soup to_be disapointing
lamb_saag was_about as_much lamb as you_might expect for_a dish costing
it's uniform liquidey sludge was_a_little_too reminiscent_of diarrhea for_me_and i lost a_little_of my appetite
though the_lamb_was_tender and cooked_well
the_overall dish_was very_very salty with_no special taste
just a_little_spicy
a little_indian
and_a_little lamb
they_are probably using curry paste from_a jar
or there_is just_not a_very imaginative cook in_the_kitchen because the_whole dish_was lacking_in flavor
besides salt
a_whole cardamom pod was left hidden_in the diarrhea sludge
which led to_an unpleasant burst of cardamom in_one bite
rice had clearly been_sitting around_for awhile and_was_very dry throughout with crunchy bits and_very chewy bits
i_just don't_see how this_is acceptable to_serve someone in_a_restaurant
rice is_one_of_the cheapest ingredients out_there
if the_rice has_been sitting for too_long
throw it_out and_make more
i_tried_the saag with_the rice_and_the oily mess of lamb_saag rehydrated the_rice somewhat
and_the rice's absorption of the_saag took away some_of its saltiness
three sauces or chutneys that_came_with the papadom were not_very_good at_all
had_to_ask to_have my_water_glass filled every single time_i finished it
this_is_a major pet peeve
excellent
excellent
very_impressed_with their assorted curry_dishes
highly_recommend
don't_expect fancy atmosphere
the_staff moves at_their own pace but that_doesn't matter when the_food_is soooo good
we_went_for_the buffet on_a_sunday morning
and_are so_glad we_decided to_give_it_a_try
my husband's favorite_is chicken_tikka massala which they_had on_the_buffet
i'm_pretty new_to_indian_food
but_there_were so_many options_and so many_things i_liked
the_service_was amazing
our water_glasses_were constantly full
which_is good considering some_of the_food_is_really spicy
we're not from_that area
but if_we_were in_the_neighborhood
i_would consider going_there again
what a_great_find
as several others_have pointed out
the_decor_is nothing_to_write_home about nor even to dwell on_it in a_yelp review
but it_has always_been my contention that_if_you offer great_food at a_fair price_and are_not offering_a dining_experience
then restaurant cleanliness and_an attentive wait_staff_is a_better investment than wood carvings and mood lighting
we_came for_lunch_and it turned_out they_had_a fantastic buffet
everything from tandoori_chicken to palak aloo
every_dish was so_flavorful and_authentic
having spent two_years overseas where_i associated with several indians
i_know they_would_have been suitably impressed
the_waiter_brought naan to_the_table and_was there_when our_water_glasses emptied
he_didn't hover but_he was_attentive
my_lunch partner and i_got_a kick out_of_the sign_that politely let buffet eaters know we_were welcome to_the_food but would_be charged for waste
it_should go without saying
but i_have_been_to several all_you_can_eat buffets and_have witnessed first hand the_amount_of leftover food_that has_to_be thrown away because people take too_much
personally i_think part_of_the blame should be placed on_the cooks managers for_not putting out a_better product
but certainly the_customer is largely to blame
hence
a_sign that clearly articulates the maharaja's expectation of_its customers is a_good_thing
let's face it
if_the_food was_bad
the_customer would_be screaming
bottom_line
eat_here if_you_love indian_food
at tha advice of_the reviews_on_yelp
my_family decided to_try_out this_restaurant
excellent_food at decent prices
if_you_like_indian_food
i_would_highly_recommend that_you eat_here
i_was_in town on business and_had_a free night so i_decided_to_give maharaja a_try
i_had_the mulligatawny soup
garlic_naan
and the_tandoori_chicken
the_food_was_really_good
awesome naan
and_the_portions_were quite large
the_chicken was_out_of_this_world and i_could_not finish_it all
the only_negative was the_service
i dined on_a_tuesday evening at
ish
it_took a_long_time for_my waiter to_take my_order
though the_place seemed relatively full
there_were only_two waitstaff
when_i_arrived
there seemed_to be several employees outside smoking
also
my waiter_was not of_indian descent
which_is perfectly fine
but_he did_not speak english
thus my questions about the_menu_and what_he recommended went unanswered
it_also took a_long_time for my_food to_arrive
from the_time_i sat down_to the_time my food_arrived was_almost an_hour
all in_all
i_would_go_back again because the_food_was_very_good
i_would_have given stars
save for_the awful customer_service
i_went_here at_the suggestion of several people who told_me how great the_food_was
i admit my_experience with indian_cuisine is_limited
but_for the_most_part pleasant
so i_thought_it_was worth_a try
the food_was_outstanding
i_ordered aloo ghobi
really flavorful_and spicy
i_don't_know_if this_is commonplace everywhere
but_since i_moved up_from texas it's_been really difficult to_order_a dish_and be satisfied_with the_level_of heat
here they asked_if_i preferred mild or hot
when_i said hot
they asked_how hot
i_said very and_they definitely delivered
my_husband_ordered the_tandoori_chicken which_is_a very generaously sized portion
it comes_out on_what looks_like_a small griddle
steaming
with peppers_and lemon slices
they_also brought_out_a big bowl_of white_rice along_with some_naan bread_that we_asked_for
all in_all
it_was_a_very satisfying experience_and we_will_definitely_be going back
service_can_be a_little_slow
but the_staff_are very_attentive_and helpful
they're also_really good_at refilling drinks
i_know it_seemed_like our_server kept refilling my glass every_time i_took_a sip
i_can't_say enough good_things about_this_place
my_husband
son and i_go_there at_least_once_a month and it_is_always delicious_and they_take such_good care_of you
some restaurants look_at you when_you_walk in with_a_little one_and grimace they_are always joking with_our son and making him
and us
feel very comfortable
the_food_is sooo good not_a_bad thing on_the_menu
if you're looking_for_a great_indian meal in_a great_atmosphere with fantastic staff this_is_the_place
our family went to_celebrate a birthday with_an indian_dinner there_were of_us in_our happy group
we_have_been going_to the_maharaja for_years
to_enjoy the lunch_buffets
valentines day
birthdays etc
tonight the_food_was_good
but_the_service_was an_issue
to_start
we_could see_that the_staff had changed
the_service took a_long_time
even though_there were_only tables_with customers_and six wait_staff
the_server did_not understand english well enough_to properly place the_order
so_there was extra wine for one_person
also
the glassware and flatware were spotted
with_some that needed to_be sent back
the_service had really changed for_the worse
the_server would clear one dirty plate
then wander off
return five minutes later to_get another and_so on
the_manager or owner really needs_to train the_staff
they_were_all working
but seemed unclear as_to who_was responsible for_what duties
we also_ordered ice_cream and a_special birthday dessert
while very_tasty the_service_was vey slow
at least minutes_from the_time the ice_cream was ordered to served
what really put us over the_top was when_they refused to accept their own gift_certificate that_they sold to_me in june towards the_bill
not including tip
it_had only_been approximately weeks
apparently
this_location has_been sold
the_old owners still own the_location on odana rd
same name
but_not this_one
therefore
they_would not accept their own gift_certificate and_told_us
we_could use_it at odana rd
interestingly
they_still kept the_best of madison sign on the_door for the_old ownership
they_will need_to take this down
again
we_were surprised_at the business decision about_their own gift_certificate
authentic_indian in_madison
wisconsin
score
the_neighborhood felt a_little sketchy
and_as_a solo diner
my service wasn't very_good
food_was_ok though
my_husband_and_i came today with_a_group_of people for_their sunday lunch_buffet and_i_have_to_say
for_the_price
excellent_service and quality_of_food
i_really recommend_this_place
i_called ahead_and they allowed our_group to_have_a semi private room away_from_the restaurant_but close_to_the buffet
the_buffet_had all_the_dishes you_would hope for and_some unexpected ones as_well
i_really_enjoyed_the chicken_tikka
chana_masala
samosa_and more common dishes
but_they also_had_a goat dish
fish
several biryanis
really_nice chutneys
etc
my only_complaint about_this_place was_that_the naan wasn't in a_basket with_a napkin to keep_it warm
it_was_just plopped on a_plate and_got cold quickly
the_naan was_great_and deserves to_be kept warm
the_dessert section_of the_buffet_had a_ton_of variety but the_mango_ice_cream was_superb
apparently
when_you_order a_meal during_the week
even take away
everyone gets a mango_ice_cream as_well
the_food_was_excellent but the_mango_ice_cream will bring me back
best samosas i've_had in_las_vegas
samosa were not_greasy
had good_flavor and_did_not skimp on_the meat filling
good dipping chutneys too
retired couple run the_place
the_wife is_friendly
the_husband
well you_got to warm up_to him first
i_always go_for_the lamb samosas which my non indian_pakistani friends co_workers also enjoy
atif is_right it_is definitely_the_best samosa i've ever_had i've_had the_beef
chicken_and veggie
very_tasty
fresh_and_hot
it_doesn't look_like much from the_outside
but_it very_well is a_full indian_restaurant
i_really_like_the na an bread_with garlic or onions here
very_tasty
plus this is_one_of_my_favorite places_for tandoori_chicken
i've yet to_try_the curry because_i'm a creature of habit with_indian_food
i_mean don't_get_me_wrong i_really_like_the spices_and spicey
you_know the_prices have_gone up
regardless it's still_good
definitely worth_it
the_staff_is_friendly_and patient i_mean i_had_a white dude with_me and she_didn't even_get mad because after visits he_got what_i got
i_wanted_to go_to panda express
one entrance east
i_just wanted_to get something quick while running an errand and scooting back_to_the conference i_was attending
minutes later
my belly was_full_of veggie_samosas and_full veggie thali_and i_was_a happy boy
i_don't dig raitha
so_they sub'd aloo_gobi without asking me
how did they_know
could they read my_mind
amazing
possibly
sad news
i chatted with the_owners and_they admitted that_they_were selling the_place
when that happens
i sure hope the lucky inheritor of_this establishment continues their fine tradition
don't_go by the_name
this_place_has nothing to_do_with samosa
you_can find better samosa in any_indian_restaurant
this_place_is run_by an_old couple
old guy is_very rude
and greedy
food_is not_that_great either
saag_paneer_was just boiled spinach with hard paneer on_top_of it
malai_kofta_was good
but seemed stale
paneer butter masala_was a_shame
naan_is good_though
everything_is over_priced
and low in quantity
no lunch_buffet
and_they_are closed on sundays
we_had to_go_to taco bell after spending on lunch for_people here
i_wouldn't mind paying more_than person on lunch if_the enviironment is good_enough
i_don't_know how come they_are surviving
probably tourists come_here_for the
samosa_factory
name and_also its close_to_the strip
locals would_never go_to_this_place again
and_the_owner place_is_not kid friendly at_all
he_was complaining all_the_time about_the little food my kid dropped
we literally had_to clean the_floor and table when_we_left
all_the_other star reviews seem made_up
look_at_the reviews at following links to_get_the real sense of_this_place

worst indian_restaurant_in_vegas
posted by sk
i_agree_with the_previous reviewer
easily the_worst indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
it_is_not even authentic_indian_food
they try to_be cute and make_it taste_like fusion food
but fail with astonishing zeal
quoting a woody allen one liner
food_is terrible
and portions_are so small
they add gratuity whether you liked the_service or_not
way overpriced
even_in more expensive metros like sfo or nyc
you do_not_have pay this much_for a_meal at_an ordinary shopping strip indian_restaurant
it's no gaylord india or bombay palace
wilshire bvld beverly hills
yet costs so_much
what gives
the_owners
husband_and wife team
serve customers sometimes
they_are curt and glum
a less forgiving person might think these folks are_just plain rude
hope this_review_is helpful
cheers
would_not go_again posted by pzippy
i_was_really_excited to find_that samosa_factory was_so close_by
i_called and_ordered and drove down_to pick_it up
i_ordered enough for_dinner_and leftovers_for the_next_day
the_manager was_very_nice when_i picked up the_food
when_i_got home
i was_more_than disappointed
the_samosas_were edible but barely
though i_must_say the_chutney was_rather good
the_lamb_korma was_not_good
the_naan was_pretty_good
but the_worst was the_spinach
saag
paneer
to_say it_was_an atrocity would_be_a compliment
i had_one bite and_couldn't stomach anymore
it_was awful
i finished the_samosas_and the_naan_and little rice_and threw the_rest away
if_you_are looking_for_good indian in_las_vegas
keep looking
because this_isn't it
avoid it
horrible food_and owner posted by susan ty
its the_worst restaurant_that i_have_tried
went_there after looking_at_the reviews at citysearch
but_was utterly disappointed
the_owner refused to_give an_extra plate to my_husband to_share the_rice pilaf
he wanted us_to dig in the_servers plate
apart from_that the_food_was horrible
it_looked_like the_food_was days old
we_got_a stomachache after_eating that
the gratuity is added on check
even_if_you do not_want_to leave_a a tip after a_horrible service
the_owner even fought with_us over this issue
please stay away from_this_place
the_food_is horrible
and place stinks

this_is_one_of_the worst indian_restaurant_in l
v
if one_is looking_for_a_good indian_food
this_is_not_the right place
owner behave very rudely especially who_are new_to the_place
we noticed_that he behave politely who_are his frequent diner
named samosa_factory but serves worst samosas
they might be making fresh_food everyday but leftovers are_also served and_we_had this experience
we eat_indian_food quite often but_never ate such food
it_seems they_serve days old food
never ever visit_this_place
cons
worst food_and_service
the_name says it_all
you_must order a_samosa
and_you_will enjoy_it
the_main entrees_are pretty_good too
my_wife is_a saag fan
its all she gets and_it_was quite_good here
i_like that_they_have lots_of vegetarian_options
we_always eat too_much when_we go_there
we average a tab
for_two peeps
items may_be_a little_pricey
but we're more_than willing to support small mom_and_pop digs like_this
the_husband
i'm assuming
is_a_little dry
but c'mon
does that_really affect the_food
the few_times we've been_there
we_had_the veggie_samosas served up hot with chutney
papadum
paneer palak
shrimp korma
shrimp_curry
paneer korma
and sweet_rice for_dessert
the_sweet_rice was_great
not_too_sweet
but_i_did have to_pick our potent chunks_of cinnamon and clove
all_of_the entrees_were great
savory_and loaded with_flavor in_the classic indian fashion
i_also_tried the_mango_lassi
which_is really sweet_and quite large_and my_bf had_the plain lassi
which_he said was_perfectly tangy
but_he doesn't like things too_sweet
maybe_the shrimp_curry was_lacking a_little
but_the korma_is always_great
if_you_like creamy coconutty sauces
when_we go_in around noon
there's no_one there
but by_the_time_we leave
there's like four other parties
i_love taking my time_here
i_never feel rushed
every one_that comes_to drop our_food or refill our_water is_always smiling and_friendly
off_the_strip
non casino
this_is_a pretty bad
okay a really_bad indian_restaurant
it_was_a horrible experience
i_don't_even know_where to_start
the_food_was bad
the_server had_no knowledge of what_was on_the_menu_and the_interior was_like a_fast_food restaurant
plus
being from the_south i'm_not knocking a southern accent
but i_don't_want my_server to_say
hey y'all what's in this_dish
you_know what's cool about_this spot
they_don't play the_typical world beat tabla bullshit that's played in most_indian_restaurants
they play jazz
and_i_don't mean smooth jazz
i_mean coltrane and miles davis jazz
the_food_is_not traditional_indian
but fresh_and_tasty nonetheless
good parathas
samosas
obviously
garlic_naan
vege biryani
salted lassis
fantastic okra
and really_fresh tasting saag_paneer
they_also sell mason jars of homemade chutney
which_are pricey_but the_chili chutney is surprisingly hot and_flavorful
by_far_the best_place for_vegetarian indian_food_in_vegas
now
for_the less desirable aspects of this_spot
i_am almost positive that they_use msg as_a flavor enhancer in their_food
a farley typical practice in indian_cuisine
because_i invariably end up_with_a headache nausea after eating_here
the_owners
a married couple
aren't terribly friendly
and_the
dead pan
husband can_be downright alienating at_times
i_would_recommend_this_place as a_nice take_out spot with_the caveat that if_you_are sensitive to msg you_may want_to avoid altogether
excellent the absolute best garlic_naan
raita
samosas we've_had light
great seasoning and right_on 'target' we_had_the vegetable_korma and_the mattar_paneer perfect and_just the_right level_of spices
our_favorite_indian is ajanta in berkeley and the_red fort in_london but the_samosa_factory can give either a run for_their money
we're looking_forward_to our next_trip to_las_vegas so we_can go_back twice or three_times during_our stay our only regret is_that we_found it on_our last_night in_town
yummy veggie friendly food
the_owner_is very_nice
and_very_friendly
best chutney in_vegas
see for_yourself
this_place_is bomb diggity
op
i'm from central new jersey
otherwise known as mumbai west
where authentic indian_restaurants_are three deep in_every single strip_mall
indian_food_is my_favorite ethnic cuisine
so_i_know good_indian when_i eat_it
and samosa_factory is_that good
this_was our_first_visit
and_it's now our new_favorite vegas indian_restaurant
the_food_was terrific
the_service outstanding
and the_waitress
katie
was_friendly
helpful
and_attentive
just_as important
we_were made to_feel welcome
by her
as_well as by the_owner
we started_with veggie_samosas
i_love them
but_don't often order them
because they're usually heavy and greasy
not_here
the pastry covering was light_and flaky
the filling was fresh_and_delicious
and_it_was one helluva stuffed samosa
the accompanying coriander sauce_was the_best_i've_ever_had
and the_chutney had_a deliciously different taste
we had_chicken_tikka
which_was cut in bite sized pieces_and mixed_with green and yellow peppers
onions
and_an assortment_of flavorful spices
the_dish_was brimming with_flavor
and happily
it didn't_have_the overwhelming heaviness that i_always dread at_indian_restaurants
my nit with_this dish_is that_we_were sharing it
so presenting it_on a_small
flat plate made_it a_bit difficult_to transfer to_our own plates
we_also shared_a chicken spinach_curry
i hesitated before ordering it
expecting the_spinach to_be drowning in cream_and ghee
it_wasn't
and_the cubes_of chicken_were the_most tender i've ever_had
the_onion nan had_an abundance of onion_and again
was lighter and less greasy than_i_expected
we also_ordered a_side_of raita
i_was intrigued by_the description
which said_that the_yogurt was mixed_with granny smith apple
hmm
different
and_it_was
the apple added a_slight sweetness
and was_the_perfect complement to_the tanginess of the_yogurt
it_was_the outstanding accompaniment for the_chicken_tikka
the_mango_lassi_was great
too
be aware that the_restaurant_has no liquor license
but_if_you must drink
you_can get sloshed before or after at pt's pub a_few doors down
i suspect kristin b
did just_that before writing her ridiculous non review
the_entrees_were served_with rice
the_menu had the_word
pilaf
blacked out
and_the_rice_was plain
white_rice
this_was_a first for_me
and it_didn't make_me ecstatic
i missed the grilled onion_and great_flavor that a_good rice pilaf with_basmati_rice should_have
but_this_is a_small price to_pay_for a_wonderful dinner that_will otherwise please your palate
and_not make_you feel as_if your fat and calorie quota has exceeded the national debt
all in_all
this_was_a memorable meal
and_one that_we look_forward_to repeating very_soon
i'm a_huge_fan
the_owner
s
have_been_there every_time i've gone
which i_think_is important
the_food_is authentic_and well_priced
while waiting_for my_indian take_out order that_has always_been the_exact same
they_offered me to_try_something they thought i'd enjoy
how many_places do_that
it_is now the_only_thing_i order and_it's not_even on_the_menu
wonderful people and_service
a_must_try restaurant
fantastic_food
very friendly_staff
rivals the_best_indian_food_in other places_in_vegas
but_very inexpensive
sad
lonely plain looking location so_don't go_to impress a_date unless she_is cool enough_to appreciate good_food
they_serve northern_indian style cuisine
no_buffet
just fresh home_cooked indian_food
i_drove crosstown in hopes of discovering something extraordinary
what_i found_in this small_restaurant was_decent
the_decor_was nicer than_i_expected
as_a
hole in_the_wall
kind of_place
the_restaurant_was cozy and had_a_nice warm color scheme
chairs and tables_were basic and the_wait_staff_was nice
however
nice isn't enough
there_were other_tables besides mine and_service felt incredibly slow
we_ordered_a lamb_samosa appetizer which_was probably_the_best dish of_the_evening
the_meat was_a_little_too lumpy
but_the seasoning was_delicious
then we_waited_for what felt like twice as_long as_it_should have_been for_our_entrees to_arrive
and_my pappadums didn't_come as_an_appetizer but_as a_side dish_with the_entrees when_i reminded our_server
communication between_the two people_working front_of_the house seemed_to be lacking
with_just other_tables besides ours
we_were asked twice at the_beginning if_we_wanted any beverages
it_just makes_me wonder what they_would do when_they have_a_full house
they might be weeded with tables
i_had_the spinich paneer_and it_was_a_little bland but the_portion_was good_and the_dish_was generous on the_paneer
the_chicken_korma was_quite flavorful though the_one scoop_of rice i_got on a_plate felt a_bit chintzy
presentation of a_single scoop_of white_rice on_a white round plate placed in_front_of a diner could use a_little color
even if_it_were a sprig of_something green for decoration
all in_all
the_experience was_fine
if service were better
i_might have_given this_place stars
but_it just goes to show
service_is_very important to dining out
though_i won't rush back to_this_restaurant
i_hope_they do well in_the_future
last april this business changed hands
before it_was authentic
tastefully done
and was_in_the upper echelons of indian_restaurants_in_vegas
ah
the_good ole days
the current establishment is_a far cry from the_previous one
first_off
the_decor_is
well
tacky
and not_even in_a cheeky vegas way either
it_is_a_bit gaudy and done in_a kitsch fashion resplendent with do_not touch signs on on touristy sitars
and i_don't_think having_a sink full_of rocks in the_bathroom sink is_very hygienic
hello health code violations
i understand menus cost money
but to_have half torn covers with handwritten higher prices scribbled in is not_a_good first impression
my_second impression was to_have_a skinny guy leaning over me like_a vulture trying_to get_me to_order
i found_out he_was the_new owner
and_the_other server looked_like she stepped out_of biker bar blue jean emporium
replete with unkempt dangly hair
and seeing her reaching over people's food made_me cringe
hair tie
anyone
against first judgements i_make the plunge and decide to_stay
since when does an_authentic_indian restaurant serve mango_lassi_with ice
and the_garlic_naan_was thin
almost tortilla thin
mostly burnt
and_tasted like_it_was sitting in_the_back for a_bit under_a heat lamp
it_got worse for the_entrees
they_were slopped in_their bowls with dirty sides
flatly spiced
and overcooked
and_the_rice_was sitting there like_a mound of_white blandless solidity
lamb_curry isn't supposed_to need_a chainsaw to slice through
and_the_chicken vindaloo_was cut in strips a_la fajitas
pounded and dense
and_i_thought the_lamb_was tough
the_waiter owner asked_how it_was and_i told i_would tell him when we_were_done
he never asked again
how_i long for the_old place
it_was cozy and_authentic
the_exact opposite of_what it_has become
and anyone from somewhere other_than vegas would_be sorely disappointed_with this_restaurant as_it_is now
instead_of the_samosa_factory
they_should rename it
the_samosa tragedy
my_taste_buds agree
i've been robbed
pretty_good food
not authentic_indian definitely a_little westernized but_still great_flavors
the_food_was_a little pricy wasn't convinced it_was worth_the_price but_it_was worth_trying
i_love_this_place
rick the_new owner_is very accomodating
my_friend from england always has to_visit samosa when_she is here
her fav dish_is chicken_korma
mine is veggie kofta with mahkni sauce
they_have great lunch_specials too
i_really_like this_place
the_restaurant recently changed ownership
and i_think_that the_change has brought_it up from_a three star restaurant_to four
the_samosas went from being somewhat bland to nicely spiced
the_service_is a_lot better
very_attentive
too
the_food_is a_bit westernized
and_all_the indian_dishes that americans know are_definitely on_the_menu
tikka_masala
anyone
then_again
food_is all_about fusion and mixing cultures
so who am_i to complain
plus
it's_all pretty yummy
the_portions and prices_are excellent
the_best_part is_that they_have_a rather impressive vegetarian_menu as_well_as_a separate vegan menu
i'm neither a_vegetarian nor a_vegan
but_i_have many friends_who are_not meat_eaters
so this_is_a place_where we_can go_and actually eat together without making strange requests
the_new owners like_to experiment with_their recipes and try_new_things they_are_very open with_their process
and i_like_that
the_bad news
i_was in_las_vegas
the_good news
i_wasn't on_the_strip
the_bad news
the temperature at_our hotel near the_strip was averaging degrees
the_good news
it_was somewhat cooler at red rock canyon
the_bad news
we_were hungry_and had_about a thousand miles of suburbs between us_and that indian_restaurant_i was meaning to_try i'd seen advertised at every bus stop in_town
the_good news
we_never made_it to that_place
okay
enough news
about halfway
or_more
back_to_the strip from red rock canyon my_stomach stopped grumbling and started screaming at me to_eat
now
whenever my_stomach gets louder than_the voices in my_head i start to_get worried
i_was scanning the restaurantscape through las vegas' suburbs for anything_that wouldn't_have gluten in_it
hi there
in_case we haven't been introduced
i'm silly ack
i don't_eat gluten
continuing down charleston i considered my options
kfc
nope
ihop
nope
vi
nope
dd
nope
dq
um
maybe after_dinner
nobody in_the suburbs has time_for restaurants with actual names anymore
we_only get initials now
i dodged
or in_my case
toyotaed
south to sahara and continued east figuring mr
stomach would just have_to_wait till we_got_to that indian_place across town
note to celiacs
indian_places are notorious for not_having gluten in most_of_their entrees
not_to_mention indian_food_in general's pretty damn yummy anyway
just ask your waiter_for gluten_free options
if the_restaurant 'gets it'
they'll be very_helpful
if_you_get a dumb look instead_of helpfulness
back away slowly
the_restaurants actually cooking their_food fresh_and not getting spice mixes and prepackaged ingredients will point_out all the_entrees without gluten and point you away from things_like breads and_samosas
did_i just see the_word samosa
that sounds indian
i skidded my rental car around a_full one eighty and hammered it back_to samosa_factory
thanks
hertz
like_it's on rails
forget about that_other indian_place
this looks like_an_indian restaurant_and it's_right here in_front_of us which makes_it the_best_indian place_in_town
there_was no_buffet
an immediate brownie point for_the factory
i respect a_place_that makes_me order_from a_menu so they_can cook_it up fresh
i_was already ignoring the menu's samosas even before our helpful waiter told_me to_avoid the_samosas along_with_the other gluten ruined food
it's_a bummer not_being able to_try_their namsake
kind of_like being_a vegeterian in_a steak house
but_i probably wouldn't_have gotten samosas anyway
so_there
instead we_got chicken_tikka_masala
aloo_gobi
and okra
i_think some places call the_okra dish bhindi_masala which sounds like_it's got a_lot_more to_it than_just okra
sf's
samosa_factory
not san_francisco
okra's got a_lot_more to_it than_just okra
so to_avoid confusion i'll call it okra
bhindi_masala
or
since we're in_the suburbs
sf's
sf n sf
o
bm
our_entrees were mind blowingly tasty
spiced about_as medium as we'd hedged on when_ordering them
whether you_want no_spice or burn your_face off hot
they'll oblige
just_be specific when_you_order
the_only_problem was that_there_was not_enough rice so the_end_of each entree ended up flying solo on our_plates
a_rather soupy
saucy solo
as_an encore we_had kheer
which_is rice_pudding
i_guess we still_had rice on_our minds after not getting enough rice_with dinner
it_was_good
but_i have_to_admit after having kheer at punjab
a sf
not sf but sf
restaurant where_they load their kheer up_with huge amounts of cardamom
pistachio and almonds
i_found_it a_little bland
like rice_pudding
admittedly samosa factory's kheer is_probably how proper kheer should taste so i'll shut up
psst
hey chef at sf
not sf
try the_kheer at punjab next_time you're_in sf
not sf
the_good thing_is after_all that great_indian_food for_dinner_and dessert there_was no_more stomach screaming
and_it_was in no_way necessary for_us_to turn back west toward dq
we_did
however venture back out_to samosa_factory the_next afternoon just to_make_sure it_was_really as_good as_we thought_it_was
it_was
i_have_been_to vegeterian indian_restaurants
reader
meet my review_of masalaa
my review_of masalaa
this is_my_new friend
reader
and_have been_to_many omnivore indian_restaurants
all_of which_had vegeterian sections on_their menus
because there's a_lot_of vegetables in_india
silly
but_i've never_been_to an_indian_restaurant_that seperated their vegeterian section into
vegeterian
and
vegan
sections
pretty smart and cutting edge
i_think these_guys are on_the technological forefront of u
s
style
not u
s
but
oh
never mind
indian dining
be_on_the lookout for_them to launch a_fast casual version_of this_restaurant in hundreds of cities by_the_end_of q
that's the fourth quarter for_those of_you not_familiar_with betting on football at_the office
if_not
you didn't hear it_here first
silly ack
i_discovered the_samosa_factory after doing a web search when_i_arrived in_vegas_for business
i grew up_eating indian_food_and eat_it at_least_once_a_week at_my local tandoori
i_was_surprised to_find so many_indian_restaurants in_my search but_was delighted to_pick tsf
the_food_is all freshly cooked using great natural ingredients and_the_service_is warm_and_friendly
the vegetarian_options are_great
i'm a_veggie
and the_vegan and_meat lists extensive also
i ate_there twice on my_last trip and_again this evening when_i_was back in_town with my_son and_his friends to_celebrate his st
they_all loved_it and_are eating_the copious leftovers right_now in_their room
we'll definitely be_back thanks
a_friend recommended the_restaurant
don't_let_the name fool_you
i_found_the interior upscale
the_staff_was_very_friendly
even when_i sent the iced_tea back
i_hate chai_tea
i_had_the butter_chicken which was_out_of_this_world
for_dessert the_rice_pudding
fantastic
it_had cinnamon and_fresh blueberries on_it
my_friend_had the coconut_chicken which_i tried also
hard_to choose between_the two which i_liked more
great_food
but_for whatever reason owner has really racist attitude with actual indians
not_sure why
twice i_went_there and_left tip but every single time as_soon as he_will see us or for_that matter any_other_indian family visiting_vegas you_can see on_his face
don't racially profile people
i_must_say that_this_is best chat samosa we ever_had_in us
samosa_factory ha being reborn with_a savior fare in their_dishes that_have me dreaming of my_next meal there
the_food_is flavor full yet light on_the stomach unlike typical indian_cuisine that tends_to be way_to greasy_and the_spices seem_to hit your stomach and_make u want_to fall asleep with nightmares
i_will_be_coming back more often now specially for_lunch since their prices_are as_good as any joints around_town
make_sure_to try_their rice_pudding it_is_so simple_and so delightful makes_me have daydreams on how_good it_is
but try for_yourself and enjoy_the rebirth of_this great local spot
njoy
had passed this_place_on our_way to hedary's restaurant registered in_our heads
later the_same evening after doing hoover dam
needed a snack
samosa being a_good snack thought about samosa_factory
with_a name like_that
samosa should be_the signature dish
right
that's_what we_thought
ordered sides vegetarian samosas as a_take_out rushed to hotel to relax enjoy the_samosas with_some nice_indian tea
what_a let down
good_amount_of filling
no doubt
but absolutely bland
no taste at_all
just boiled potatoes
half a_samosa consumed rest relegated to trash
don't think we_will_be visiting this_place_again
nor recommend_it_to anyone
thorough let down
we_are
indians as_in bombay
from
georgia
here_for
week vacation
i've been hearing good_things about the_samosa_factory for_years
but_had yet to_make_it over there until tonight
it_doesn't look_like much from the_outside
but it's_really cozy cute inside
the_tables chairs leave a_bit to_be_desired
but they_really did a_lot with the_decor to_improve the_ambiance
we_ordered chicken_vindaloo hot sour chicken
which were_both good
the_vindaloo_was awesome
really_spicy delicious
the_hot sour chicken was_good
but all_the sesame seeds in_the_sauce were_a_bit much for_me texture wise
i_also_had a hot_chai
which_was perfect
the_owner came_by and talked to_us
asking us_what we_thought of_the_place and_how we'd heard_of it
he was_really_nice and_made me_feel very welcome and appreciated as a_new customer
also
they_were playing great music
right after finishing my_meal
while sipping on_my tea my_favorite my morning jacket song came_on it_was_a really_nice moment
went_here yesterday for_lunch
it_was_ok
if_you_like samosas they_were_good here
other_than_that i've had_better_indian_food
they_have plenty_of_vegetarian and_vegan entrees though
so_if you're vegan or have a_friend_who is then_i would reccomend this_place
but tamba and ghandi are_better
the_place_is pretty_small too so dont go with_a_big group
also it was_full_of white people
im white too
but thats kind of_a giveaway that_its not_as authentic as other_places because i_did_not see one indian eating_there
it_seems that everyone_is in agreement that the_food_at the_samosa_factory is not_bad
the degrees to which people like_it seem_to vary
my_wife_and_i ate here_for_dinner one_night and_found the_food_to_be
good
without being outstanding
portions_were small
even by the_usual standard of_indian_restaurants and the_total came_to close for_the both_of_us for a_couple_of appetizers a_couple_of main meals and some_naan
overall there's_a reasonably tasty meal to_have here
but_for a_tiny and sparsely decorated restaurant located_in an unremarkable strip_mall i_expect a_lot_more bang for_my buck
one_of_the_few vegas_indian establishments not_to offer a_lunch_buffet
great tasting and healthy indian
well
supposedly healthy because they_said they_don't use ghee
ghee gross pure fat
but_the_food_was definitely delicious
and_reasonably_priced
too
will_definitely be_going back_when craving_some hot n' spicy indian_food
this_is quite possibly one_of_my_favorite little indulgences
it's quaint
family_owned
and_their dedication to serving quality meals is_very obvious
i_absolutely_love their veggie_samosas and_tikka_masala
not_sure if_they serve_the watermelon shrimp_dish anymore
but the_flavors_were completely unique_and amazing
if they_still serve it
order_it
you_will_not_be_disappointed
the_samosa_factory is_very vegetarian_friendly and uses fresh_ingredients
the_staff_is so polite_and welcoming here
my only_complaint_is_that i_wish_the dining_area was just_a_little bigger
best_indian_restaurant i_have_ever_had
being_indian i_am_very picky and know what good_indian_food is
this_place_has exceptional service_and the_menu_has options_for everyone
vegan
vegetarians
meatatarians
and_even halal options
on_the downside
i_would_not reccomend this_place_on a_busy friday or saturday_night because_they_are usually understaffed
this_restaurant is_one_of_my_favorite places_for comfort_food
i have_known rick for_a_long_time and_i_love his cooking and_how personable he_is
his restaurant reflects his passion and kindness
it_is_a great_place_for lunches and group parties for_dinner
many nights have i savored the_delicious butter_chicken
on busy nights its_good to_be patient
as sometimes there_are very_little staff with rick doing most all_the work
bless his heart
the_service_is_great and_it's_a great_atmosphere to_dine
you gotta try_the hot chai_tea to_help digest all_that great_indian_food
i_love_it here and_take all my_friends out when_they come visit las_vegas
it_is truly a_gem
i_don't_know_what happened between my_visit
s
and the_ones where people_are hatin' on the_samosas
because_i_had some_of_the best samosas i've ever_tasted here
and_that includes homemade ones by some very talented pakistani cooks
they_were obviously made_to_order
as they_came out piping_hot_and crisp
and the_chutney
my god the_chutney
had i not_been in public
i_would_have licked the bowl clean
they_have much_of the_standard indian_fare
but one_dish that_is unusual is_the fresh spinach_curry
i've_never_had anything like_it
barely wilted tender baby spinach leaves in_a delicately spiced tomato sauce
not bland
but_not your_typical indian_curry taste either
and_definitely not_spicy
ask_for it hot if you crave the_heat
love_love love that_they_have a_whole section_of specifically vegan entrees_and that anything on_the_menu_that is vegan is_clearly marked
no guesswork
reasonably_priced lunch_specials
great_food
good_service
my only_complaint_is_that they're not closer_to work or home
omg so_good
i'm the pickiest eater in the_world
and_i discovered indian_food_at a_different restaurant
i_came_to samosa_factory
because a_friend_of_mine suggested it
and_i_was wowed
the_food_was_awesome
the_prices_were also affordable
love_it
was_good
is_ok
went last time and_was_not very_happy_with it
one_of_the_best_indian restaurants_in_town
they_do serve the_best rice_pudding
reasonable_prices
i_usually order the_chicken_tikka_masala or the_lamb_korma
great_quality food
their sauces_are rich_and creamy
i_think each entree is_good for_people
depending on how hungry you_are
but_i've always_been stuffed sharing an_entree
small_restaurant
but great_service
food_was_ok
they prepare food based on vegan style
food_was_not very_authentic as_i_had hoped it_to_be
it's_a_good place_if_you are_looking_for simple indian_food_and not for_spicy
masala food
i've_been_to several of_the_more popular indian_restaurants_in_vegas
and this_is_by_far my_favourite
samosas_are always_fresh and flavourful
with_a_nice mix_of subtle spices_that is_well complimented by a_selection_of chutneys
hot
crispy perfection
the_lamb_korma is pure curry heaven
too
the boneless lamb is_always tender_and super tasty
with creamy_sauce over fresh garlic_naan_and aromatic basmati_rice
is_your mouth_watering yet
then get off_the internet and into your car
head down_to samosa_factory for the_best_indian_food vegas has_to_offer right_now
i can't_really compare their samosas to the_rest_of_the world's
so_i'm giving_them the benefit of_the doubt
i_tried_the vegetarian and_the_lamb
i_ended_up preferring the_vegetarian
though i_love lamb
i_found_the fluffy potatoes_and the bite of the_peas inside_the crunchy shell really enjoyable
the lamb_samosa seemed_a bit_dry and flavorless
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
to_use as_a standard of measure
i've_had several versions by now and_enjoyed most of_them a_bit_more than_this
i_felt that this_one_was pretty mediocre
with big tough chunks_of_chicken in a_lot_of runny sauce
the_amount_of rice they_give is a_single bowlful per entree
which is_ok if_it's one_person but wouldn't_be enough_to feed both my_boyfriend_and_i
i'm_not sure_if they_charge for_the additional portions_of rice
but it_would_be worth asking if_you_order more
also
i_like spicy_food
a_lot
i initially ordered the_extra hot version of_the_dish
which the_server assured me would_be extremely hot
face melting
ly so
i eventually backed down_to just_the
hot
i_ended_up being very disappointed_by_the overall heat_level
the_other diner in_the party who ordered_a hot dish agreed in_that her dish wasn't particularly spicy
either
the_overall flavor wasn't_too impactful initially it had_a_nice creeper heat
but_it hit a mid note and_then mellowed out
there_were_a_few pieces_of fresh herbs floating about in_the orange sauce
which_is a_nice_touch
their_rice had_a_good texture
i_like that_they_have clearly marked and distinguished menus for_vegetarians and vegans
i'd_be willing to_give_them another_chance if someone wanted us to_go
but they're out_of_my way and_didn't particularly impress me the_first_time around
i_liked that_their iced chai_tea was_served without milk or creamer
making_it a_lot lighter and_more refreshing
i'd never_had it straight like_that and_it_was nice
another diner tried the_mango_lassi and_didn't like_it
it_was then offered on to_any willing participants and eventually found it's way into_a garbage can several miles away_and melted
i ate_at samosa_factory twice last_week
both_times trying different lamb_dishes
they_were both outstanding
i_also couldn't help ordering multiple portions_of the_garlic_naan both visits
rick and_his staff do_a phenomenal job
the_kitchen_and dining_room are small_and inviting
unlike so_many other_places in_las_vegas
rick is_also_very knowledgeable
quality driven and_friendly
this_place_is somewhere you_should check out_and frequent often
it_is hard to_find_a small owner driven place_like this in_vegas_and we need_to support the_good ones out_there
great authentic little sleepy indian_place
outstanding service and_great_food
stars
the complaints about_the_food being bland are valid but_only because they_cook all_the_food mild be default
it says in_the_menu to_ask_for spicy if_you_like some kick
i_can understand this but_didn't see_the section in_the_menu mentioning it_so we_got_our food mild and_it_was certainly mild
great_food though
very_light
not heavy like_most indian_restaurants_and coming_from an_indian family i_know my_indian_food well
looking_forward_to going again_and asking_for some
kick
had
veggie_samosas
good chutneys
papadum
also_good
chai
excellent
saag_paneer
very_good
pretty_sure the_paneer_was fresh also and_not_the indian grocery_store verka dhawat nanak prepakaged
chicken_tikka_masala
good
needs kick though_there was_no
tikka
skipped desert was_too full
total cost was under bucks with tip tax will definately go_again
amazing place
i_love that feeling of_a
family_owned
business off_the_strip and not_a franchise
the_owner
richard
is_amazing
he is_very interactive with_the customer and remembered my friend's order_from last time he_was there
that_just shows you how amazingly attentive he_is
we ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
lamb spinach
shrimp_curry
and tons_of their_garlic_naan
i_also_ordered their mango_lassi for_my drink_and it_was_just amazing
i_could_not stop drinking it
if_you_like_indian_food
this_is_a_great great great_place to_try_out
they_also_have_a vegan menu too
i_love me_some vegan_friendly indian_food_and the chutneys_were awesome
stars_for the_service_and the_samosas_and chutneys
the_samosas_were delicious_and had_a_great flakey outside with a_little_bit_of salt that_made them really pop
the_service_was_great_and super_friendly
stars_for the_rest_of_the food
the_entrees_were a_little under spiced_and over salted
this may be because_we_were not asked_about spice_levels when_we_ordered so we_got generic bland style
the_eggplant
which_is_a favorite at most_places
was_our least favorite
it_was_a_bit over pureed and_had little spices
out_of_the entrees
the_fresh spinach_curry was_a standout
it_had_a great_flavor
with_your dinner you_are only served a_small scoop_of rice on_the plate
which_was not enough_for a_second helping of_food
since_i wanted spicier food
i_asked_for something hot to_put in and_was brought_a chili paste that added a_good kick to_the_food
i_will still highly_recommend_this_place and will_be_back in_order to_get_some spicy_food which i_think will_be much better
i_am looking_forward_to giving this_place_a star_review next_time
this_place_had great_atmosphere a_perfect gem in_the_wall
it's not_a_huge restaurant_but that's_what makes the_service better
the_staff_was_very hospitable and_attentive
we met the_manager rick
who_is the_most sweetest
humble guy
it's great_for groups of
but i_went_with_a party_of
which slowed the timing of_the_food
totally understandable since_they aren't use to such_a large_party
the_food portions_are family_style
and_are reasonably_priced
we_ordered their signature samosas
kinds
beef veggie
that's served_with different kinds_of dipping_sauces
my favorite_is_the green cilantro one
the_butter_chicken
yummy creamy tomato curry
the_lamb koran
coconut curry
chicken koran
garlic_naan
sweet spicy_chicken
tandoori_chicken
sooo good
and_a_couple more curry_dishes which i_can't_remember the_name
everything was_really_good
and this_was_my_first_time eating_indian_food
all_the_dishes were very_flavorful
also
try their_mango ladee drink
it's_a creamy yogurt smoothie
and_also their signature rice_pudding for_dessert
indian_food is_my_new addiction
thanks_to samosa_factory
d
this_is_the restaurant i_go_to whenever_i travel to_las_vegas on business
i'm clearly not the_only person_who feels this_way
because_i overheard someone at the_next table say the_same_thing
it_has great_food and_it's_a very_friendly place
there aren't many vegetarian_options in_las_vegas
and this_is_the_best i_found
it even has an_extensive vegan menu
which_is extremely rare
i tried_a_few of_these and they_were_all excellent
i_particularly liked_the turnip dish
a_real treat
i_haven't seen it anywhere else
the_decor_is simple_and not luxurious
but_it's comfortable and_it's_a pleasant place to_visit
the_owner_is not_indian
but_is passionate about_indian_food and obviously has a_strong affinity for_indian culture
which to my_mind gives the_restaurant an intriguing blend of_indian_and american culture
the_best_naan bread in_town
this_is_by_far my most favorite_indian_food place_in_vegas
i've_been_to many and in_my_opinion you need_to_go the_restaurant that_makes the_dish you_like the_best
my_favorite_dishes are chicken_korma_and the shrimp_vindaloo
this_place makes these_dishes off_the hook
i've_had these at other_indian_restaurants here_in_vegas and_they just_don't match up
even_though_i don't_like the_lamb here i'm_still giving_them a because they_make my_favorite_dishes the_best
the_garlic_naan is_by_far_the_best i've_had too
incredible
my_husband_and_i aren't too familiar_with_indian_food so we_didn't really_know what_to_expect
pleasantly_surprised would_be_a complete understatement
it_is_a small
cozy
and_warm environment
we_were immediately greeted by who we think was the_owner
he was_extremely_friendly and informative for newbies like us
he_suggested the kameer rather than_the hot and_sour chicken
boy oh boy were we glad_that he_did
it was_one_of_the_best dishes i've tasted
we were_super excited to_try_the naan after_reading all_of_the reviews
everyone_was spot_on
so_delicious
at the_end_of_the_meal he surprised us_with a_generous sampling_of the_rice_pudding
wow
it_was sooooo good
d
needless_to say
we_will_be_back very_soon to_enjoy more delicious samosas
pakora
kameer
naan
and_excellent rice_pudding
i_would_have rated stars_if i_had_the option
mmmm mmmm mmmm
a hit and_a miss
we_went_here looking_at_the reviews_and were disappointed
don't_get_me_wrong
if you're new_to_indian_food
like many reviewers here seem_to be
you'll probably like_it
unfortunately for samosa fake tory
we've_had our share of_good indian_food_and samosa_factory isn't it
first_off
to_the uninitiated
samosas look and_taste nothing_like the one's you_find here
i_mean
not_even close
google samosas and_you_will see_what they look_like
after_our samosas
we_ordered_the thalis
sort of_an_indian mixed plate
and_the_naan
fluffy
delicious_indian bread
was_great
i_didn't_like the_saag
mustard leaf
but_my so did
neither_of us liked the_chicken_curry or_the potatoes_and cauliflower
contrary to popular claim
the_rice wasn't basmati
you_can't ever_go wrong_with mango_lassi
mango flavored yogurt drink
and_that probably was the_best_part_of our_meal
in summary
our food_was_okay but_the alien samosa was_a massive fail
if you've never_had_a samosa please do yourself a_favor and grab one from an_authentic_indian restaurant
you_will_not regret_it
may i_recommend gandhi's on paradise road or tamba on_the_strip for_the_most authentic_and best_indian_food_in_town
positives the_service_was_good
our_server
who i_think_is also the_owner
seemed_like_a genuinely nice guy
not your_typical indian_restaurant
small seating_area
the_food_was surprising
again not typical_indian
food_was tasteful but_not burdened with_spices
i_love_this_place
i eat_there every_other weekend
garlic_naan is_to_die_for
the_food_is_excellent and_so is_the_service
sooooo yummy
they_have_a_great vegan menu_and the_people who own it are so_nice
we_ate dinner_there and_asked the_guy if we_could order some to_go since_we_were moving and had_no food_in_the house
he_made us a_bag full_of stuff with about triple the_amount_of rice and_lots_of extra sauces
at no extra charge
along_with paper_plates and plastic forks which_was_a godsend since all_our dishes_were packed up
it's_a_small thing but_i_thought it_was_very thoughtful of_them and_it_was_a big_deal to_us
paneer that melts in_your_mouth
yum
spicing that_is mild_and yet has wonderful complex flavor to_it
restful atmosphere
attentive_service and fresh_food with_little oil
so_good_that i_went_back a_few_days later for another_meal
was thrilled to_see so_many vegan as_well as vegetarian_options here
have_eaten_at lots_of indian_restaurants in_the_bay_area and vegas
and this_is_my_favorite of_all
looking_forward_to my_next_visit to_vegas and coming_here
samosa_factory is_where i_go_to read a_book
eat something delicious_and feel taken_care of after i've_had a crap day
if_you're_a spice fiend
be clear and firm about your desired spice_level
otherwise
it's_pretty tame
i_wouldn't say bland
but_if_you enjoy crying while you_eat
you_will_be disappointed
i_especially love
their veggie samosa_chaat
their samosas
duh
the_hot sour chicken
their_naan and oh_my god
i_love_their khir
no matter how full
i_always cram in an_order_of khir
i_don't_have much to_add to_the comments of previous reviewers
but
this_place_is delicious
and_the_fact it_has_a good sized vegan menu but_also serves meat things is_a boon for carnivores like_me that want to_be_able_to dine with_their vegan friends
oh_yeah
and_the chocolate cherry samosa that_we_had for_dessert was_to_die_for
i_was debating on giving this_place four_stars instead_of five
but_i couldn't help to_give_it five because_of_the hospitality
uniqueness
and deliciousness of the_cuisine
this_is_definitely a_gem worth seeking in_las_vegas if_you_want something different
i'm_a newbie at indian_cuisine
the_menu_was at_first overwhelming because a_lot_of_the items i_was largely unfamiliar with
names and_all
but the_eggplant
onion
and tomato happened_to stand_out to_me
and_it_was really the neighboring table that made_me make my decision
i_received more_than_a plentiful bowl
a scoop_of rice
and_tried the_garlic_naan
my god
i_didn't_think vegan could taste as_good_as_it did
while it_did taste better_than it_looked
i_couldn't be_so harsh because_it_was definitely flavorful_and really hit_the_spot
the_place_is surprisingly small and_modern with_indian decor
the hospitality and service_was_excellent
the_waiter very_friendly
but_i wished there could_have_been_a second one because the_day i_went there_was_a large_party
so service_was_a_little more delayed than usual
i_felt_like the_server had_no problem_with any requests or questions that_i_had
and was_more_than willing to_get anything i_wanted
i_would_recommend not to_come_here if_you're_in a_hurry
you_sit down when_you arrive
but it_takes time to_make_the food with_the_quality that it_has
and the_whole place seems to_have_a patient
relaxed atmosphere
the_garlic_naan_is awesome
they_have great lunch_specials
try the_lamb
best indian_food_i've_ever_had
their_lamb is_always perfect
every visit
i_have_to have the_following
a hot_chai
lamb samosas
masala fries
and_an order_of_naan
every main_dish i've_had was_great
perfectly_cooked
and any_time i_had_a question
the_servers or_even the_owner_was extremely cordial
if_you_have food allergies
trust_me
they'll help you out
and if_you_have_a vegan girlfriend
cough cough wink wink
then my_girlfriend
i_mean
your girlfriend will_have plenty to_eat
as they_have almost half the_menu full_of vegan_and vegetarian_dishes
cannot recommend_this_place enough
make_sure_you check_it_out
we_had never_tried_indian_food before
since_we_were new_to vegan eating
we_found_this_place through yelp
the_service_was_excellent
we_had roti w olive oil and_garlic which was_awesome
for the_entrees we_had_the eggplant w potatoes
tomatoes and_onions as_well_as_the veggie kafta which_were good_as_well
we_went mild but probably could_have done medium_spice
highly_recommend
this_is just_a_little restuarant in_a shopping mall that_if_you weren't looking_for it
you_would never find_it
on_the_outside the_place_looks rather deceiving as_it could_be confused for_any number_of strip_mall type businesses
however
once_you step inside your senses are completely delighted with not_just the aroma of_delicious cuisine but_the appeal of the_dining_area is striking as_well
had the_butter_chicken with garic naan_and my_partner had_the cchicken curry
both_dishes were served_at a_great temperature and_i gotta tell you the_butter_chicken_was succulent and the_tomato based broth was_to_die_for
i_would_definitely_go back again
when_it_comes_to ethnic cuisine this_place_is_a real winner
this_is_a regular spot_for my coworkers and_i to_meet for_lunch_and go over territory info
the_samosas_are great_and_the entrees_are authentic
check_this_place out
i glanced a_recent lv weekly about_their great write up of_this establishment
praising the_food
particularly the_delicious and_well done vegetarian_options as_well_and was reminded that i_ate_here about a_year_ago and_wanted_to update with my_review
for_food
yes
this_place was_very_good
however
jez
why on earth did you give_this_place such_a low review
because the_service_was terrible and gave_me no good reason to_come_back
especially_with two great indian_restaurants by me
check_it_out
my party_of three and myself went out
on_their suggestion
to samosa_factory
they're fans of_the_restaurant and_are frequent diners there
so_i pretty much left all_of_the ordering up_to them
the_samosas_were great
the_side dishes_were appropriately spicey to_our requests so
as_i said
the_food_was_just fine
the_server
however
a
when_i informed that_we_were going_to_be paying with_two credit cards as_we_were going_to split the_bill
i_was_told this_was no bueno and that_i_had to_go outside in_the rain in_the_middle_of_the meal to_go next_door_to the_grocery story to_get money
so_i went off and_oh hey after hours the_grocery story blocked access to_the atm with rows of carts and closed the entrance that permits access to_the atm
so i_had_to purchase something from the_grocery with money back on_an atm card to_get money to_pay_for said meal
i_was_not happy
b
server started_off okay and progressively became slower and slower until it ended in_a trickle at_the_end_of_the night
read the_next two to_see our indicators
c
i_ordered_a thai tea in_the_middle_of_the meal_and it_just never_came
d
i requested a refill on my_water three_times before we_finally just signed the_check and_i picked up a_bottle_of water next door
i_even requested it_with the_check
hey
can i_get a refill of_water and the_check
samosa_factory just did_not do_it for_me
which_is_a shame because the_food_is_great
but i_don't_care how delicious cheap glorious the_food_is
because if the_service leaves me feeling_like the_staff doesn't want my money
i'll go elsewhere
this_place_is_great and a_fine value
the_food_is_great
the_service_is_great and personal
i_have_been_to somosa factory many_times_and always_come away happy_and full
went_to lunch_here a_few_weeks_ago with_my two sisters and_ordered a_few samosas
the_paneer makhini
garlic_naan
and the_malai_kofta
it's_very difficult_to mess up these items_in the_first_place
and_they_were all_delicious
the_only_thing_i didn't understand was_that although we_ordered_it to_be_very spicy_and high on_the
thiku
scale
we_received very_mild dishes
the_service_was_very nice
our glasses never_went empty_and i_was_a happy customer
despite the_lack_of spicyness
very_friendly service_and lovely food
we_got_the garlic_naan
lamb_curry
okra
and_paneer mahkni
sauces_were tasty_and all was_delicious
the_rice_pudding with blueberry topping was divine
i'm lactose intolerant and_ate nearly everything myself
holy cow
yeah
no kidding
the 'best rice_pudding in the_world
' i concur
difficult_to locate this_place_if_you don't know_where to_look
it's in_the strip_mall directly west of_the panda express on_sahara
the exterior isn't anything to_write_home_about
but the_interior_is tastefully decorated and smells wonderful
i_want more rice_pudding
i_really_like it_here because
the_food_is_excellent
really well_spiced curries that aren't too oily
great_naan
awesome samosas that_are fried just_enough and won't wreck you with too_many potatoes
unpretentious
relaxing atmosphere that feels very hospitable but_not_too overwhelming
recommend_the molai kofta curry_and_the tikka masalas
good times
i've never been let down at_this_place
in_fact i now make_it a weekly stop
as_others have_said
service_is_great and_the_owner is_a_great guy
my weekly meal is chicken samosas and_lamb_vindaloo
hot
the_garlic_naan_is amazing also
this_restaurant_is wonderful
great_service_and amazing_food
wonderful selections for vegans and vegetarians too
this_restaurant_is worth checking_out
great spices_and extremely flavorful
i_have_eaten here regularly for quite some_time
the_food_is consistently delicious
my_favorite_dish is the_lamb_curry lunch w garlic_naan_and iced_tea
all_their dishes_are extremely good
and_the_owner is_really_nice
i_often take friends_and family when_they visit from out_of_town
and_they_are always impressed
i_think this_place_is_a best kept secret in_las_vegas
hands_down_the_best_indian restaurant_in_las_vegas
rick makes me_feel like an_old friend as_soon_as_i walk_in the_door
so_my dining_experience is_that much_more enjoyable
cozy and_relaxing decor_and a menu_that features staples such_as tikka_masala_and lamb_curry
and_of_course plenty_of_vegetarian and_vegan selections
my goal is_to try_everything on_the_menu
but lately i've just been having rick create a_dish for_me_and i_have_yet_to be_disappointed
love_this_place
pretty damn_good
the_veggie samosa_was yums
great_place
very_small inside
only about tables
wonderful_food
great owner
some_of_the best tandoori_chicken i_have_ever_had
it_was cooked perfect
and_it_was_a to_go order
i've_had my eye on samosa_factory for some_time
but finally_got around_to trying_it last_night when our_first choice_for dinner_was closed for_the holiday
we entered the_small dining_area and_were greeted_by_the incredibly friendly server
we_told him we_wanted_to order our_food to_go_and he still offered_us two glasses_of water_and a_starter to nibble on while_we perused the_menu
we settled on the_lamb_vindaloo and_the_chicken_tikka_masala
we also_ordered some_garlic_naan
our_server_was incredibly personable and offered_us refills on our_water while we_waited as_well as made_some idle chit chat with_us
once our food_arrived
we_paid our bill_and off we_went_with our_food
the_server also offered_us a_to_go menu for_our return_visit
great customer_service
my fella and_i dug into our_meal as_soon_as_we got home
the_spice_level was_just_right
we_ordered_the medium spice_level to be_on_the safe side on our_first_visit
the_garlic_naan was_delicious_and i_really_enjoyed_the rice
the_flavors_were right_on and i_look_forward_to a_return visit_to hopefully eat_in the_restaurant_and try_some_of their samosas
the_food_is_not cheap
but i_didn't_feel it_was overly expensive_for the_quantity and quality_of_food we_got
definitely a_great_indian option in_a town that_is lacking
yummmmm
while my_first_experience was a_little_less than stellar
i_can easily overlook it since the_paneer is_always fabulous
it's_a_bit far away for_me so every_time_i come_here
i stockpile paneer dishes like i'm preparing for nuclear war
the_selection_is really_good
the_prices_are fairly standard for most_of_the local indian_restaurants
and_it's never been less than delicious
in_fact
i_like_it so_much_that even_if the_service sucked
which it_does not
i_would still come_back
i_think_that says a_lot
the_garlic_naan is_great_and_the veggie_samosas are to_die_for
i_think about_them way more_than i_should admit
the_samosas_are delicately crispy_and the_potatoes are fluffy_and packed full_of rich savory spices
samosa_factory has my vote for some_of_the_best_indian_food i've_had_in_a while
went_there once and_this_place was_amazing
staff_was_friendly and_accommodating considering we_had_a gift_certificate that cut our_check in half
i_loved that_this_place was_a supporter of npr which_is where my_friend got_the gift_certificate
and we_were_not_disappointed by the_food either
we each got two samosa apps
the vegetarian_options and_the fries
both were_delicious
for_main course
she got_the buttered chicken_which she told_me was_good
and i_opted_for_the paneer korma
which_was cheese cubes in_a coconut curry_sauce
delicious
the_garlic_naan was_also_good and help me scoop up that delicious coco curry_sauce that_i_had left_over
we_were too stuffed for desert
but_i'll be going_back_for samosas_and dessert_and i_only hope my_next experience_with the service_and_food warrants me to_keep this_place at stars
p
s
oh and_i_believe the state of_a bathroom can_say a_lot about a_restaurant and_this_place keeps my faith in_this theory alive
finally a chef who understands flavor
i_have_been_to many_indian_restaurants in_many great cities
as_well as india itself
most_places over spice_and use less than quality_ingredients
this_place does neither
the_food_is quality_and the_taste is_like being in_india
the_chef will cater_to your liking if you prefer
he_has some intense spices if heat is_your favorite
but the_food_is_good for_all
decor
music
and_ambiance all give_you_a sense_of being right in_the heart of true india
i found_this_place by accident but im really glad_i_did
great lunches specials and spicyness of food_is just_right
best_indian_food and workers are the_nicest
i've_been_here several_times for_lunch in_the_last few years and_i resent misti for saying_that it's_not_the
best lunch decision
okay i_don't_really resent it_because i_see where she's coming_from
but based on_my experiences it's still one hell of a_lunch decision
i_usually end_up doing take_out but_have dined in as_well
i've tried many_items from the_lunch_specials to_the entrees_and have_never_had anything_i disliked
my_favorite item
the baby spinach_curry happens to reside on the_lunch_special menu so bonus for_me
with that_you_get a_healthy serving_of rice that_you_can smother with_the tangy tomato curry_sauce the baby spinach will_be drenched in
get_it spicy
i find_it most enjoyable when you_get the_perfect mix_of curry_and sweat dripping from one's brow
i_also order a_side_of regular_naan and substitute the ghee butter for evoo
dip that right into the_curry or make a_little pita out_of it_and go_to town on_it like_i do
unless there_are people watching
also a_fan_of their veggie_samosas
if you put_it in the_name_of your restaurant
it better be_good
and_their chicken_curry is good_as_well
oh_and veggie kofta curry
i_have_no idea_what exactly that_is
but it_was_delicious
kinda like little vegetarian meatballs or falafel but_in a_delicious curry_sauce
rick is_always great_and i've_never_had an_issue with_the_service
though on days where it's packed he can sometimes be stretched a_little thin_and it_can take a_little longer that_way
as_an aside i_also once saw him go outside_and lay the smackdown on a_few crackheads that appeared_to be camping outside_of his door_and blocking the entrance exit
so tip him well
i_don't_know_what his breaking point is
the_only_thing_i found okay was the_garlic_naan
apart from that_everything was_pretty bland compared_to what other_indian_restaurants offer
i_am_an indian too and_i_would have_to_admit that it_wasn't what_i expected
there_were_no authentic spices which_we use daily in_our cooking
we_had_the mango yogurt
lassi
and the_yogurt was spoiled
smelling sour and bad
however rick totally denied it saying
we make our own yogurt and ther eis nothing wrong_with it
thats a lie
i_am never going back_to_this_place
there_are_so better places_in_vegas for_indian_food
try_indian masala its great choice compared_to its availability
the one_thing i_love about the_samosa_factory is_they no not use heavy oils to_cook their_food
i heard_about from friends but trying_it will make_you never eat heavy weiged down indian_food again
there veggie_samosas as so_yummy
our picky yr old twins love them
highly_recommend_this
off_the_strip
joint
it's tiny inside but worth_it
this_is the_best_indian_food_i've_had since_moving to_vegas years_ago
very small_restaurant
always people dining
but_never a_wait
the_owner server is_very_friendly_and knowledgable
listen to his recommendations
you_cannot leave without_the chocolate cherry samosas
i'm not_a_fan_of chocolate with fruit
but these_were amazing
i_love_this_place
while the_service_is sometimes a_little_on_the slow side when they_are busy
the_food_is_always hot_and fresh_and_delicious
the_lunch_specials are a_real deal
but the_other regular_menu offerings are also_great
and_i encourage you_to venture off_the lunch_menu and_try something different
the_saag_paneer is_always delicious
the_curries_are great
and_the_naan the_perfect accompaniment to sop up_the juice from whatever you_have chosen to_order
i_also love how the_owner always welcomes me back
and_if he_has not seen me in_a_while
gently chides me_for it_and encourages me back
try_this little restaurant_for wonderful indian_food
and_you won't_be_disappointed
not recommended
i_have_ordered tandoori_chicken all_over_the world
i never_had green tandoori_chicken
i asked_the_waiter of_the order_was mixed up and_he_said no
they_do_not use artificial color
i_gave it_a_shot
horrible
real tandoori uses cayenne
turmeric
paprika and masala for the_red color
then baked in_a tandoor oven
i_recommend they hire a_real chef from_india
i_read so_many rave reviews about the_garlic_naan_bread
the_worst naan in_my_life
burnt
thin_and taste_of only garlic
if anyone knows a_great_indian_restaurant
please tell_me or invite me over_for mom's cooking
this_place_is called samosa_factory for_a reason
the_samosas_are amazing
they come_with a_tasty cilantro chutney and_a tamarind_chutney
per order and_they_are a_very_good size
really worth_the
price
they_also have_some unique items
such_as masala fries covered_in cilantro
onions
and_come with_a bbq cilantro ginger sauce
very_tasty
i've never been impressed_with their_curries
a_little bland for_my_taste
but they_do_have a_lot_of vegan_options
which_is_nice
staff has always_been friendly
great_place
oh
this_place
it_was this_place that made_me realize that sometimes the_worst review has the_most truth in_it
i've_never_had such bland indian_food
ever
as another reviewer said
i_should_have known from_the type_of customers in_there
no indians
we_ordered their masala fries
tikka_masala
and a_coconut shrimp_dish
the fries were fine
tough to mess up fries
although they_didn't_have the distinct flavor they sounded like they_would_have
the_other two_dishes
i_didn't_know you_could call the_same dish under two_different names
both looked the_same
tasted the_same
and_were regretful the_same
and_it_was just_as expensive as a_good_indian_restaurant
on_the upside
the_naan_was_good and_the_service_was pleasant
great_food_and even_better service
disappointing
i_really wanted_to like_this_place
it_is_the sorta divey feel i_like in eateries
but the_food_was_just not_very_good
i_ordered_the samosa_chaat and_it could_have_been_a great dish except at the_last second the_chef decided_to add black pepper to the_top
a_lot_of it
the_basmati_rice was salty_and over cooked
the_paneer_was a soggy mess with_a weird texture_and woeful lack_of spice
the_tandoori_chicken and_garlic_naan_were yummy
that's why it_gets stars
but_overall the_food_was_not worth_the cost
the_shrimp korma and_garlic_naan_were amazing
great_service_and atmosphere
although_we don't frequent indian_restaurants very often
we_decided_to pop in_for_a little snacky snack
we_just needed something_to hold us over for_dinner
so we_got_the pakora
and_chicken samosas
both_dishes were very_delicious crispy outside
soft_and flavorful inside_and the_dips and_chutneys were_also addicting
looking_forward_to returning_to try other_items when we're in_the_mood for_some_indian eats
aloha
food_was_ok
ordered to_go_and they_got my_order wrong
unfortunately i_was already home_and hungry
so_i didn't turn back around
instead_of cheeseburger samosa
i_got_a pastry filled samosa
instead_of a veggie_samosa
i_got some_other chickpea veggie dish
chicken_masala was_pretty bland
i_was_really_excited to_try_this_place because of_all_the good_reviews and recommendations
but_i_was left disappointed
husband_and_i ordered beef samosas
chicken_tikki marsala
lamb_curry
garlic_naan
and_dessert samosa
the_food_was_delicious
we_enjoyed it_very_much
the_service_was_great_and our_server_was very_friendly_and_attentive
we_will_definitely be_back_for_more
the only_negative i_have was that_when_i asked_for_a straw
i_was handed a_cup full_of unwrapped straws and_asked to_pick one
i cringe at_the thought of how_many dirty
unwashed hands have touched all those straws
ew
oh_my gaga
this_place_is awesome
scrumptiously delicious_food_and the_owners_are very_friendly_and pleasant
they_have vegetarian_vegan menu_items
a musttry recommendation
will_be_back_for sure
wonderful
once_again a_new place_to define by
awesome
best_indian_food anywhere
what can i_say
this_is_not only my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in vegas
this_is_my_favorite restaurant anywhere
it is_located on_sahara avenue
very_close_to a_lot_of car dealerships
banks
insurance agencies
etc
so at_lunch time_you will_find many_people on their_lunch breaks who work in_the_area
no_buffet here
all food_is made_to_order
fresh
and the_way you_want_it
spicy
medium
mild
cream
no cream
etc so_it_is great_for customizing
they_have_a page with about vegan_options
which_is_a rarity in itself for_me
since_i happen_to be vegan
they of_course also_have many_vegetarian
and_non vegetarian_dishes you wont find on your_typical menu along_with all your favorites
oddly enough the_owner_is_a quiet
white guy
not from_india
yet he_has mastered indian_cooking more_than anyone go figure
the_food_is the_main thing and_once you_go there
there_is no turning back_to your_typical buffet
there_is_a lunch_menu
with about or choices
but_you_can also order_off_the regular part_of_the menu if_you_want_to get a_lot_more options and_the_portions will_be larger but cost more
the
paneer makhani
dish_is just heavenly and_is basically an orangey red colored thicker gravy like texture sauce_with cheese cubes in_it
since_i am now vegan i_do_not order_it but_if_you_are vegetarian or_even a meat_eater
you_have_to try_this as_one of_your dishes
it_is_great for pouring over your rice_or sopping up your_plate with_the_naan or roti bread
everything_is made right there
even the_samosas
no frozen boxed samosas here
pakoras
and_chutneys
not jarred like most_places serve
are_all made_fresh here and_delicious
the_quality_and pride that goes into each and_every dish_is such_a delight
one wonders why many other_indian_restaurants don't take note and try_to step it_up too
instead_of serving so_many oily
and in_many cases
flavorless uninspired creations
if you_think you_are an_indian_food connoisseur
but you_haven't yet tried samosa_factory
i_strongly urge you to_try_it
and_once you_do
there_is_a good chance you wont want_to_go anywhere else
and may find yourself becoming an instant regular
i swear he uses secret addictive ingredients in_his dishes to_keep customer craving and thinking of_them all_the_time
wow
a local took_me here_last nite
my_first_time for_indian_food
believe_me
i_will_definitely come_back
great_service_and the_chicken_korma and_garlic_naan
out_of_this_world
everything_i tasted was_awesome and_the_staff_was incredibly friendly_and knowledgable
i_highly_recommend stopping in
great_food
great_service
chicken_tikka_was awesome with_fresh peppers
iced_tea had_a surprising and refreshingly different flavor
this_place_is_the bombay digity
located on_sahara and decatur
this small_restaurant will give_you_a cultured taste_of_india
the_place_is small_and very_clean
which is_a_must in_my restaurant world
i_was greeted by a_very_nice helpful waitress who took_the time to_explain their_menu and_the pronunciation of each_dish
i_ordered_the spinach paneer
i'm a_huge_fan_of spinach
and_this put me into cloud
the_dish consisted_of spinach_and tofu
and_some type_of sauce
im really clueless when_it_comes_to indian_food
i_just ask what's in_it and_i eat_it
haha
also along_with_the paneer i_had_the garlic_naan
it's_good to_have with_your paneers they compliment each_other
for_dessert i_had_the keer
which_was some_sort_of rice_pudding with berries on top very delish as_well
samosa is_also vegetarian vegan_friendly which_is_what drawn me_to the_place
me being_a transitional vegetarian_vegan
i_was curious what options i_had_in an_indian_restaurant
overall_i was satisfied with_the_service and_the_food
they_also have lunch_specials during_lunch time
i_did_not even bother to_look_at that
but will_give it_a_try when i_go_back
i_am_not well acquainted with_indian_food
as_much_as_i like different ethnic foods i_am quite wary of extremely spicy_dishes
a_friend_of_mine had been_wanting_to try_this_place out
but did not_want_to navigate the_place alone
we_went_in and were_seated quickly
it_is_a rather small_place
but_there_was a_mix_of customers
some were business people while others were families
the_atmosphere_was nice_and cozy and_we quickly got comfortable
neither_of us_was particularly hungry_and after getting drinks decided_to ask the_server for_his advice
we decided_on ordering a_few_different samosas
we_had_chicken
vegetable
and_lamb
we also_got an_order or spiced fries
it_was_the perfect_for the two_of_us
everything_was_delicious and_we_were checked upon often
i_can't_wait_to come_back with_the boyfriend so that_he may also experience this_place
it_looks_like a_great_place_to take a_date
perfection
we discovered samosa by yelp's direction
ordered garlic_naan to_start our session
the_tandori_chicken is_worth of_a legend
the lamb_saag will jolt your essence
the_lamb kabob is no_exception
believe_it or_not
i_am of a_different nation
my_wife says samosa cures my retardation
this_was_my_first_time trying_indian_food i_loved_it
i_can't_wait_to_go_back and try_more things
the_service_was_great as_well
i_would definatly recommend_this to_anyone_who is trying for_the_first_time great_experience
i_love_this little_place
the_food_is fantastic
the_owner rick is_very personable and makes_it pleasant to_eat_here
i_wish_i_could eat_here days per week
i_was visiting from philly and_wanted delicious_indian_food for_lunch
upon doing a google search
samosa_factory was_the_only place_with excellent reviews so i_tried_it for_myself
i was_not_disappointed
the guy_who served me was_so pleasant
the_food_came_out in a_short amount of_time
i_ordered_a vegetarian dish_with naan_and iced chai
the_flavors was_so amazing
i_loved that they_give_you just_one heaping scoop_of rice because i_don't_like too_much of_it
could_only eat half my_meal
so_i_was given_a container for_the_food and_a_little bag for_the_naan and bonus
a_to_go cup for_my iced chai
i_found that to_be_very thoughtful
it_isn't a_big place but_the decor_is_nice and_warm
i_wanted_to go_back before leaving but never_got the_chance
i_highly_recommend_this_place
really
really
really cannot say_enough about_how much i_love_this_place
the_best_indian_food_i_have had_in_las_vegas by far
if_you_are new_to_indian_food and_want something different but_tasty i_can always recommend the_lamb_korma
it's perfect
with_a_side_of garlic_nan
some samosas
of_course
and_mango_lassi this_is_my_favorite dinner
if i_was_on death row
i_may very_well pick samosa indian factory for my_last meal
their restaurant_is tiny
but i_like_it
it_doesn't feel overly crowded but actually cozy
i_really can't say_enough good_things about_this_place
ok place_for groups
not_that super for couples or singles
why wouldn't they_offer_a samosa with the_thali platter
check their name
why_not offer a_better thali combo option
papadum
dessert samosa in the_thali
found it_to_be a_bit_pricey for_what it offers
such_a_great hardworking guy
do_not miss_the dried fruit stuffed naan
his apple chutney
or his samosas lots_of terrific vegan_dishes too
gluten_free
you've found a_great_place_to enjoy delicious_food safely
great_naan
great food_and_service
loved the_samosas
we_got veggie_and lamb
my preference was the_veggie
the_saag_paneer was_tasty tasty_but i_wish_i_had a_tiny salt shaker
blasphemy
garlic_naan
delish
the_vegan roti
bread
and_spinach tomato curry here were_excellent
it was_absolutely_delicious
unfortunately
you_have_to drive here
so it's_not convenient if_you_are staying on_the_strip
it's in_a_strip_mall and_easy to_miss
oh samosa_factory
you_have my_heart and tummy
i_have now eaten_here almost every_time that_i've visited vegas
it's a_must eat
i loooove the_veggie choices and_of_course the_garlic_naan
i_can't decide which one_is more wonderful
the_owner or the_food
you'll want_to_eat them both up
one tip
finish your_meal off_with the_rice_pudding
absolutely_delicious
my_go_to place_for_indian_food in_vegas
it's_one_of those best kept secrets for_indian_food for vegas in_my_opinion
it's_a casual ambiance place_with great_food that's reasonably_priced
i_always_get their naan_bread_and paneer
i_love_it here also for_their great vegetarian_options
love_it
my new_favorite spot in_vegas
i_go at_least_once_a_week
the_malai_kofta korma_is just delicious as_well_as_the vegetable samosa's
garlic_naan_and i'm_sure everything else on_the_menu
cute little_place
great_service
and_food to_die_for
thumbs_up
love the_samosa_factory
the_staff_are delightful
food delicious such_a pleasant atmosphere
i've taken family friends here everyone loved_it
i'd_recommend this to_anyone_looking_for some delicious_indian_food
yelp you disappointed me tonight
you know_if the_restaurant_is run_by people whose ethnic background does not match the_food
something is bound to go_wrong
sorry
just_a stereotype of_mine i_cannot break
anyways
we_decided on_indian for_dinner tonight
and_i suggested to_try samosa_factory as_i_had bookmarked this_place_for quite some_time
the_restaurant had mostly positive_reviews which_is_what convinced me_to stray from_our usual indian_joint
the_restaurant_itself_is small
definitely_a
hole in_the_wall
type_of place
we_were_greeted by_this a_large caucasian man
definitely_not what i_was_expecting at_an_indian_restaurant
not_sure if he_was the_owner
but in_addition_to seating us
he took_our_order
and_served us our_meal
we_order the_chicken_tikka_masala
shrimp_vindaloo
and_garlic_naan
both entrees served_with basmati_rice
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was not_what we_were expecting
prepared completely different_from any_other_indian_restaurant we've ever_tried
i_was_expecting yummy curry_sauce
but_this hardly had_any
although it_wasn't badly prepared
it_just wasn't up_to our liking
the shrimp_vindaloo was_nothing spectacular either
this had_more curry_sauce than the_chicken_tikka_masala
but_nothing impressive
i_like curry_sauce to_be thick
this_was more watery
lastly
the_garlic_naan_and basmati_rice were_just average
i_didn't_care of the_naan because_it_was thin_and dry as opposed_to thick_and fluffy like_how we_are used_to having at_mt
everest
sigghh
what_a disappointing meal
sorry to_say
we won't be_coming back
my_favorite_place in_all_of las_vegas
i_only order things
so it's_hard_to rate it_all
the_veggie korma_and spinach_curry
i_love them both
the_garlic_naan_is covered_in garlic_and cilantro
it's delish too
my_husband is_not adventurous
he orders the_chicken_tikka every_time
getting him_to even go_in was_a_huge effort
now
most days it's his idea to_eat_here
i_also highly_recommend iced chai_tea
we bought a_groupon and_thought this_place must_be awesome for all_the_great reviews_on_yelp
the_place_was certainly a_hole in_the_wall
the folks that work there_were super_nice
we_ordered_a veggie_samosa which_was great
we_ordered chicken_vindaloo tasted bland_and tomatoey
no_real indian_spices popping out or_any hint_of tartness
i'm from san_francisco and_we dine at naan_and curry all_the_time and_their vindaloo_was my gateway to indian_cuisine
i order_it at_other_places and_it's great
the_chicken_was half_a breast cut into slithers
no_real chunks_of bone and_meat
there_were several pieces_of potato in_there
it_was_like half_a potato all together
it_tasted_like a filipino goat stew but_more bland
the_lamb kabob was_bland too
no_real indian_spices popping out
it_was_like one kabob cut into sauce like slices mixed in_this tomatoey sauce_with red peppers
it_was sweet_and bland
the_samosa was_great but_i couldn't taste any heart in_the meal
no tart
no spices
the_people that worked there_were again very_nice_and great at explaining things_and talking with_us
it_was quiet pricey too
wish_i had known how small and_quick this_restaurant was
it_definitely would not_have_been my choice_for my anniversary dinner
flat naan
bland samosa_chaat
good lamb_vindaloo
oh i_just remembered we_ordered pakoras too
and those tasted like fried nothing
was_excited for the_spices and_the textures or the_onion
cauliflower
and_potato but_this_was just potato hash
the_flavor came from_the chutneys
i was_also_very sad that_we_were in_and_out in_minutes and_we_were trying to_eat slowly
everything came out in_minutes and_our mango_lassi_was delicious
but_i wish it_were cold
the temp made_it just seem like a_bowl_of yogurt in_a tall glass
my_boyfriend and_i_have_been spoiled by eating some_really authentic_and great_indian_food and these_were our favorite_dishes there
wasn't terrible
but won't be_back
i_miss this_place sooooo much
it's honestly deliciousness in the_best way
the kashmiri naan filled_with dates cannot be rivaled
and_the veggie_dishes are ridiculous
i'm_so happy_to_see this_place thriving
it's quaint atmosphere_and mood lighting on_a_friday_night is_perfect
and_i'm excited_to enjoy_this wonderful place_again
delicious
my_husband_and_i were in_las_vegas_for a_few_days and purchased several groupons to_try while in_town
samosa_factory has become one_of_our favorite indian_places
we_had_a chicken samosa
chicken_tikka_masala
saag_paneer
and_plain_naan
the_chicken samosa_was packed_with flavor_and very_fresh
the_chicken_tikka_masala was_not_as sweet as we_liked
but_still fantastic
the_saag_paneer was_more saucy than other_indian_places
regardless
we really_liked_the dish
the_service_was absolutely fantastic_and topped off_the wonderful night
i'd definitely_recommend_this_place
really great_service
food very_flavorful_and fresh
made_to_order
owner is_very_nice_and accommodating
bernie hanna
i_have brought my_friends_and family here and_they absolutely agree_with me
food_is_amazing and_so is_the_service
it's a_perfect place to_come if_you're_a vegan vegetarian
i'll be_coming back whenever_i get a_chance
i_was truly excited to_try samosa_factory after_reading_the rave reviews_and receiving a_recommendation from_a_friend
since their page states that_they_do not_take reservations
i_figured it_would_be a casual establishment and_that coming with_a_group wouldn't_be an_issue
when_we_arrived
the_restaurant_was empty with just_one pair dining
the gentleman that greeted us_was accommodating in bringing tables together for_us
however
it_seemed_like he_had expected us to_call ahead_and made_a comment about our_group size
adding that_it_was a_good_thing it_was early
pm
we_thought this_was odd given_the
no reservations
situation
when most_of our_group arrived
we_were approached by the_same gentleman to_take drink_orders
then
when we_had everyone
he came to_take_our appetizer order
since_i_was at the_other end_of_the table near the_kitchen
i_couldn't hear him
nor did he make an effort_to be heard
he stood at_the_end_of_the table and_didn't bother coming around or closer to_the_other end
he_didn't smile once
he_was lukewarm
and_seemed bothered
he acted the_same way as_our evening continued
seeming unhappy to_even serve us
we didn't_feel very comfortable or welcome
the_same gentleman was_very warm_and_friendly to a_couple that sat down at_the_table next_to us
even sitting with_them for_a moment
so_it_was apparent that_he was capable of_these positive behaviors
it_was_just odd
there_was another young woman that assisted us as_well_and thankfully
she_was kind
food wise
my fianc and_i_ordered lamb samosas
garlic_naan
and_butter_chicken
makhani
we_also_tried the_tandoori_chicken
lamb_korma
and quesadilla naan from_our friends
everything_was okay unimpressive and not_as_good_as what i've_had at other_indian_restaurants
i_was_really disappointed_with_the chicken_makhani because that's one_of_my_favorite_indian dishes_and this version didn't do_it any justice
also
i_wasn't wow ed by the_samosas or the_chutney
the quesadilla naan_was surprisingly_good and i_liked_the tandoori_chicken
unfortunately
my_experience wasn't a_good_one with disappointing food_and_service
my_friends_and_i still enjoyed ourselves
so it_wasn't a_complete disaster
by the_way
the_restaurant didn't fill up_in_the two hours we_were_there
so there_were_no issues with space
this casual
table restaurant was_busy on_this thursday evening
but_we lucked out by securing a_table
the_owner provided menus with_us choosing to_share orders_of lamb spinach
butter_chicken_and kashmiri naan
the_lamb_was_tender
but the_spinach was_on_the runny side
the_chicken in the_butter_chicken_was on_the tough side
overall our_meal was_pretty_good
but_a notch below the_best so our search for_a_great indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas continues
a rating of
would_be appropriate
went_to the_samosa_factory with_a dear friend_for lunch
she_was greeted_by_the staff and_we_were ushered to_her usual table by the_window
the_server_was courteous_and attentive
unfortunately
the fare was_not_as commendable
i_ordered_the_lamb curry
lunch_special
a_hot chai_tea
and_vegetable chaat samosa
the_chaat arrived first
a heaping plate_of green chutney
creamy yogurt
and innumerable other colors and_flavors
the_chaat was just_okay
try the_chaat at mount_everest down the_road to see_what real chaat should taste_like
the chai_tea arrived after
a_big steaming cup with_a dollop of curdled cream floating on top
this_was so disappointing
it_is impossible to_find good chai in_las_vegas
does not_taste like_indian chai_tea
next the_lamb_curry arrived with_a heaping scoop_of jasmine rice
it_was bland_and unenjoyable
my_friend enjoyed her chicken_tikka_masala_and naan
i_tried_the naan and_it_was hot_and_fresh
though a_bit thin_and crispy
there_are too_many excellent_indian_food options in_las_vegas to return_to samosa_factory
i_had real bad_experience at_this_place
person catering the_customers at_this_restaurant has_no respect for_his customer what so ever
he_had shown such_an attitude that we_all decided_to walk_away from that_place
all we_asked_for is a_separate check before we_placed an_order
and_the_guy was_completely rude
i_will_never go_to that place_again nor will recommend to_anyone
there_are many better indian_restaurants_in_town who cares for customers_and serves way_better food_than this_place
i_would rate this_place zero star if_i_could but unfortunately yelp is_not having that option
if_you_don't care_about your customers someone else will
enjoy
i_found out_about samosa_factory through a_groupon special
we arrive mins before closing time
we_ordered delicious spice fries
lamb
soup and_chicken
all_were well presented and_tasty
by_far_the_best_indian restaurants_in_vegas
our_server gave_us_a full size rice to_take_home with_our leftovers
very thoughful
you do_not need_to_be on_the_strip to_get great personal service
wonderful spot
i_suggest everyone try_it
the_service_is attentive_and_friendly
food_is prepared fairly quick_and includes a_wide_selection of_great tasting vegetarian_and_vegan dishes
it's_a_nice
cozy cute spot for_people
has takeout available also
want_to_eat at_a place_where the_food_is consistently delicious
this_is_the_place
my_family_and i_have_been_here times_now_and it_never disappoints
all times we_have_been served by the_owner who is_amazing
great_service_and he called my_daughter by name all night
which she loved
samosas_are incredibly delicious
we_had_the beef and_lamb this_time
i swear
one_day i'm getting like of_these and that's_all
my_husband_had_the chicken_curry extra_spicy
my_daughter and_i_shared the_tikka_masala very_mild
portions_are big_and we_had_some left_over
the_naan_is cooked_to_perfection
i_suggest ordering lots
as_it's perfect_for sopping up the_sauce from your_meal
my_family_and i_will_be_back again_and again_and i_suggest you_go too
best indian_food_i've_ever_had in_my_life
not_greasy
fresh
full_of_flavor
my_boyfriend who hates indian_food
loved_it
and_now wants to_go_back
amazing vegan vegetarian_menu
no other place_in_vegas like_it
i've been_going to_this_restaurant off and_on for_years
amazing_food
that's_all i_can_say
wow wow wow
i couldnt have better things to_say
we_ordered and shared three entrees
they_were_all amazing
service_was outstanding
food_was_outstanding
and location_is easy_to find
this is_a_must_try
i've read plenty of good_reviews about samosa_factory and true to story you can't_go_wrong coming_here
upon walking_in my_husband_and_i were_greeted and_seated
the_owner_and waitress was_very_nice_and had_good suggestions for the_menu
we_ordered
chicken_korma
lamb_vindaloo
garlic_naan_and onion kulcha
we_were given mango_lassi to_try
everything was_absolutely_amazing
the_service_was_excellent
i_will_be going_back_for sure
best_indian_food ever
it's clean
fresh
and so_flavorful
in a_little out_of_the way spot totally unassuming
had chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
chicken_korma
roti
samosas
and chai
all_was unbelievable
we're so_happy
not_too keen on taj indian
based on_one visit
two words
scary bathrooms
you_have_to walk down a_long hallway at the_back_of_the building to_get there it's_right out_of_a david lynch movie
two more words
slow_service
we_had_to practically beg a_server to_wait on_us
and there_wasn't_a big crowd to justify the_wait
the_food_was_good
but_i_would much rather_go to one_of_the indian_restaurants on state street before going_here again
i've_been_to taj times and_have_been consistently pleased
i've_never_had slow_service
it's always_been very prompt_and incredibly pleasant
they_bring you_a neat little trifecta of_sauces to_use on_your crispy bread starter
i'm actually not_sure i've ever gotten anything other_than their saag_paneer
i dream about_their saag_paneer on_my lonelier nights
but maybe someday
firstly
i_should say this_place does have delivery
in_fact
more and_more restaurants_are offering_a rd party delivery service called straighttoyourdoor
com
they_are one such place_at the_moment
i have_gone here_a_few_times
dinner_and lunch
the_dinner experience i_found slightly slow
even though nobody is_there
maybe its based_on_the way they prepare food or_something but it_feels_like you_wait forever
even_with an_appetizer
i_still waited a_while after finishing it_for my_main course
lunch_is where_it is_at
for
they_have_a lunch_buffet_that includes naan
if you wanted to_be el cheapo
if you forgo a_drink
that_is under
i_believe with a_drink
it goes slightly over
but_still
that_is cheap for_a_lunch
it's a_great_way_to introduce others to_indian_food or give yourself an opportunity_to explore other_things you might_not otherwise order for_dinner
i_find the_wait_staff very_friendly and_you_can tell they_take pride in_their restaurant
went_there_for brunch yesterday
sat
two words
stay away
yes
the_owners look friendly
but_if its good_indian_food you're looking_for
taj is a_big let down
the brunch menu_was sparse
most dishes watered_down
tasted nothing_like they_should
food didn't_taste fresh to_make_it worse my glass_of_water had stuff floating in_it
i_always_get_the chicken_tikka_masala_and it's_always delicious
the_staff_is pleasant_and i_haven't_had a_bad_experience
the_price_is a_bit steep
but it's_worth_it for_the occasional dinner splurge
taj serves up the_best_indian dinner in_all_of madison
i_have_been on several occasions and have_always enjoyed all aspects of_my night_out
the_restaurant_itself_is pretty_small but very_well lit and cheery
there have_been several other groups dining during_my visits
but i_have_never_had to wait_for_a_table
the_staff_is always attentive but_never in_the way
the complimentary poppadom with_three chutneys is a_great_way_to start the_meal off
all_three chutneys are very_flavorful_and completely different_from one another
the_chai is_wonderful
i'm pretty_sure it's made_with cream
great_naan too
for the_main_course
my_favorite is the_vegetable_korma
it's the_perfect combination_of creamy_and spicy
i_am_a little skeptical that the_vegetables were frozen minutes_before the reached my_plate
but who's to_care if it_still tastes_like heaven on earth
the_saag_paneer was_also_very_good
i_have_yet_to try taj's lunch_buffet
but_if the_food_is anything like it_is for_dinner
i'm_pretty sure_i won't_be_disappointed
i'm reviewing this_place since_it's the_best_indian_restaurant_in madison
but my_review applies to all_the_other ones in_the_city
if you crave real indian_food
i_would_highly_recommend you stay away from_this_place
the_food_in their_buffet_is very watered_down to_cater_to american tastes since there's practically no spiciness or flavor to anything in their_buffet
heck
even_the watered_down indian_food places_in san_francisco are more_spicy
and_better
than this_place
however
like any_other_indian_restaurant in_madison
this_place_has cheap reasonably_priced buffet lunch_specials which makes_it worth_a_visit if you happen_to be starving and in_the_area
but_if_you have_any real expectations about indian_food_in_the region
you're better off trying your luck in milwaukee or chicago instead
first to_arrive for_the_lunch_buffet
so the_food din't sit for long
literally had_one of_everything
i shouldn't be allowed at buffets
so i_got_a good sense_of what they_had to_offer
the_good
pakora
the_vegetable
cauliflower
was_better_than the_fish or_chicken
crispy well_seasoned
saag_paneer
creamy
thick rich
but_not excessively so
kofta
nice soft texture
good_flavor
well sauced
gulab_jamun
not offensively sweet
good texture
kheer
same_as above
the just_okay
samosas
garlic_naan
basmati_rice were fine but unremarkable
watery dishes
chicken_curry
chicken_tikka_masala
dal
raita
would_have_been much better if the_sauce had_the consistency of the_saag_paneer
the wtf
beef at_an_indian_restaurant
no lamb
no_spice heat
bathrooms are kinda retro but_not scary
i_recently just_got back_from a_trip to_india
jaipur
rajasthan
and the_dishes listed under 'good' above were comparable
at less than
it_was_a_great deal_and will_be_back
admittedly
i've_never_had the_lunch_buffet
as_for_the dinner_menu
though
delicious
the boy and_i eat_there at_least_once_a_week
often twice
we_go through withdrawals if we're away too_long
since we're both veg n
i_can_only attest to_the vegetarian offerings
but between_the two_of_us
i_think we've_had everything_in the_veg section
and we've never_had a_bad_meal here
every plate has_the option_of mild medium_spicy
and extra rice is_always available free
even_when you take half of_the_food home
as_i usually_have to_do
the_portions_are perfect in_that
if you're like him
it's a_perfect stomach stuffer and_if you're like_me
i always_have leftovers_for the_next_day
particularly_good dishes_are the baingan bhartha
vegetable mango
and bhindi_masala
the_cheese eating boy swears by the_saag mushroom and_paneer jalfrazie
the_samosas_are wonderful
and the_onion chutney is_always amazing
be_sure_to add a taj_mahal beer for the_perfect meal
the_prices_are great
two meals
an_appetizer
and a_couple_of drinks comes_to less than before tipping
the_service_is_always prompt_and friendly
and_while the_atmosphere_is casual
we often venture in in hoodies and jeans
you_could easily make_it a_nice date outing
the lighting is soft and_the_decor nice enough
taj is_an all_around great establishment with_a_great family_owned feel that's friendly without being overbearing
we recieved superb service_and memorable food_here
rice
papadum
and_a chutney assortment were_all included with our_meal
which_i don't recall always being the_case at local indian_restaurants
we will_certainly return
the_lamb_vindaloo here_is delicious
nice interior and_great_service
i_want_to give_it five_stars
i_went_here easily times over the_past three years
i've_been_here for_both the all_you_can_eat lunch_and_dinner
dine_in and dine out
i_really_like_the people who own and run the_restaurant
and_i would_love_to see_them keep dishing out food for_years to_come
but despite my loyalty
i_just can't_go above three stars
first of_all
it_is pretty pricey
and up for_entrees
and an_extra
for_the almost obligatory naan
for plain
granted
it's a_lot_of_food you_get_a big serving_of rice along with_a_large
generous portion_of meat_and curry
but_it's madison
i_can eat_at some places very_close for_under
second
i_know it's recycled lunch items on_me for_dinner take_out
it's_not hard_to tell
dried out
reheated naan just doesn't taste_like it_does when_it's piping_hot out_of_the tandoori oven
i'm pretty_sure i've_had reheated lunch servings of_curry as_well
it_didn't happen every_time
but_it happened enough_that i decreased my visits
lunch_is probably better_than dinner
with_a_big selection to_choose_from
and_all_of the_food_is_good
i'd_definitely recommend_it for_lunch
i_feel_like the_chef needs_to go_on
kitchen nightmares
the_food_is_great
but_it just seems_like somewhere along the grind of maintaining a_restaurant the_owners chefs lost their passion
gordon ramsey
make them whole again
then maybe_i can come_back_and update my posts after_i get_some fresh cooked food_at_a reasonable_price
yum
i_have_never really had_indian_food_before and me_and_my man went_for_the_lunch_buffet
it_is_an buffet and_while it_is_not huge
what_it had_was diverse
at least for_me
i_was up_for trying anything
which_i did and_it_was all_good
i_loved_the samosas and_i dipped them in_a yogurt_sauce that_they_had available
i_tried vegetable_korma which_was tasty with just_enough heat
and_saag_paneer
which_was different but_still_good
my_favorite was_probably_the vegetable_pakora
and_of_course
the_naan
i_also_tried the_desserts
which weren't my cup_of tea but interesting
they_have_a gelatinous dessert called gulab_jamun and_i_found out that_it_is soft fried_cheese balls
i_didn't love them
but_i_did love_this_place
ah i_miss this_place
it_was my_favorite_place to_have indian_food in_all_of wisconsin
service_was exceptional
and_the_food_was beyond great
the_price_is reasonable_and we_went_there a million times with_no hiccups
the_only weirdness is having_to use_the restroom
it's so_far away
and that_it_is on_the ever unpopular park street
don't let that deter you
it_is_so worth_it to_dine here
a_good_place for date or family adventure
i_am_not_a buffet person so_i cannot tell you if_that is_good or_not
but the_meals are insanely delicious
love_this_place
i_would_give ten stars if_i_could and signed up_for a_yelp account just so_i_could share my awesome find with others
hands down some_of_the_best_indian food_i've_ever_had
and i_lived_in india
great
friendly_and fast service in_a cozy atmosphere
i've been for dine_in dinner_and take_out_and have_never_been disappointed
their prices_are incredibly reasonable i_highly_recommend_the combination dinners they_have_a vegetarian or meat combo that includes three curry type dishes
nan
rice
pakora appetizer_and dessert for_under
the_chicken_tikka_masala_is incredible like everything else
they_give_you generous portions
enough_for at least another whole meal at_home
yum
the_only draw back is_that_the are_a_little off_the beaten path on s
park but well_worth_the extra five or ten_minutes out_of your way
wow
this_place_is_a great pick for that_night time date
family get together or_just some place great last minute
the_buffet of_course is_the_best but the_evening menu_is delicious
i_had_a spicy lamb_dish and my_daughter had an_amazing crab crepe
over the_top good
lovely_and elegant place_but modestly priced
no other place_to_go_for lunch_or_dinner
a_must
great dinner
good_service
i'm_not sure_what made_me think of_this_place today
but_i miss eating_there
good_food_and the folks who own it are a_real pleasure
it's_not that indian_food_in philly is terrible but_it ain't great neither
glad to_see taj is_still doing
ever_since my_husband took_me to my_first indian_buffet_in_town
i've been trying other_places like_it
today we_went_to the taj
and i_was_pretty excited
it_was_very cozy
and_the_staff_was so_friendly
but_as far_as food_selection and food_quality
definitely_not worth_it
the_one fish dish they_had was_so dry
i_could barely chew it
and_this_was only an_hour after they'd opened today
so you'd think_it would've been fresh
i_would_not recommend_this indian_buffet
and_would instead direct others to either a
swagat on old sauk rd or b
maharini on west washington ave
i_don't_think i'll be back_to_the taj though
good_buffet
good_service
good_prices
and_the_food_is stars
my_favorite can't miss meal is the_butter_chicken_and naan
stars
amazingness
i_used_to come_here when_i_was at university and_nothing has changed
my_friends_and_i ordered samosas
garlic_naan
chicken_vindaloo
chicken_tikka
masala
and chana_masala
no_complaints
very_tasty
now_i noticed a_few people complaining about the_price
but to_cook these sauces_and samosas at_home takes more money than you'd_expect
also it's a_lot cheaper than_other cities
bonus
lunch_buffet
if_you_want some yummy indian_cuisine try taj
love taj
lunch_buffet_is a_great_value and the_food_is_delicious
madison has_some very_good_indian_food options
and this_is_one_of_the_best
i_have_eaten here_about times_and gotten take_out maybe another
great_indian_food
excellent_service
and_a_nice setting
you_know those places_that have stuff hanging off the_ceiling but_it_is greasy_and has cobwebs
well this_isn't it
taj os bright_and cheerful and c l e a n
the_vegetarian and
meatatarian
specials_are both good
ask to upgrade the basic naan_for a_small upcharge to garlic or ginger
the_indian wine
which i_had_never had_before going_here
was impressive
lighter fruits and various floral flavors blend beautifully and pair nicely with_the dishes
and the_wine is very_reasonably_priced
oh
and the_only tandoori i_have_ever_had that_is moist too_many are dired out
overall a_wonderful value
and_nice enough you_could make_it a_special event dinner
the_place_is quite_nice in appearance and_seemed very_clean
the_food_was hot_and the_buffet_was kept stocked nicely
the_food_wasn't bad_but wasn't_that good either
when_i think of_indian_food
i_want a depth of_flavor
some intensity
the_food_here was none_of that
it_was even somewhat bland
the_chicken_masala had nice chunks_of white breast meat
but_there_was hardly any spice_in it
seemed_like midwestern chicken gravy
and the_beef curry_was just_as flavorless
the nana bread was_good as_was_the rice brian's
but_that_was about_it
ordered takeout from this_restaurant
the_food_was_great
had the_chef selection
which_comes with_three entree choices of the_chef
try_the peshwari_naan
the chopped raisins give the_naan a unique
subtle sweetness that goes very_well with curries
all_the curries i_have_tried are incredibly flavorful_and well balanced
their_lamb is so_tender
like almost_all indian_restaurants they can't cook the_meat directly in_the_sauce since there_are_so many_different sauces
but_this lamb_is very_delicious in_its own right
same goes for the_fish and_chicken
favorite curries so_far
lamb mughlai
chicken_korma
really_enjoyed_the_food and the_experience
super_nice staff
easy_to_get in_and_out of the_parking_lot
reasonable_prices
super yum
yum
yummy
i_got taj delivered to_my apartment last_night as i_didn't_feel like venturing out_to a_restaurant
it_was super fast_and arrived piping_hot
i_was_very_impressed
i_got_the matter_paneer and it_was_the_best i_have_ever_had
super flavorful
the_rice_is also_delicious as_was_the naan
i_got an_order_of plain_naan this_time but_would try_a_new flavor next_time
one_thing_i would note for next_time is_that_the dinner options come_with a_side_of_rice
i_didn't realize this as most_places i_have_been_to everything comes a_la_carte
so_i_ordered an_extra order_of rice but like_i said_it is_delicious so_i'm_not complaining
what are people giving good ratings talking about
for_starters
the_bathroom was disgusting
flies everywhere
there_are_some in the_main restaurant
too
they left the_tikka massala unfilled until several people finally asked_for_it
the_naan_was obviously just heated up in_a microwave
it_was_also pretty cold
yuck
i_go here_when i_don't go_to_the square for_the other_indian_places
always my favorites_are the_chicken_tikka_masala_and carrot_halwa
the_mango_ice_cream is_always_good
the_chutneys are varied but mango_chutney is extra
the_naan could_be better
the_only_other negative is_the restroom
its unpleasant
taj is_consistently fabulous
we always_get_the chicken_saag
baingan bharta
and_lots_of naan
the_naan_is flaky
not_like a flat pancake as we've_had at other_indian_restaurants
there's plenty of chicken_in_the saag
and_the baingan bharta is full_of vegetables_and flavor
very_good quality_and nice portions
especially_with take_out
even_though_it takes us minutes_to_get to_taj
this_is our new_indian_restaurant of_choice
i_ordered delivery when_i_was in_town_and got_the vegetarian combo dinner
the delivery was fast_and everything_was_delicious
i_will_definitely order_from here_again next_time i'm in_town
hands down_my favorite_indian_food in_madison
can't_go_wrong_with the_naan or tikka_masala
they_offer delivery
which_comes with slightly larger portions than dine_in
very_tasty_and good_prices on_the_buffet
the_only tiny drawback is_the mazelike path to_the restroom
but_i_didn't come_for_the potty
i_came for the_samosa
bring_it on
i_am relatively inexperienced with_indian_food
and as_someone who_is very_picky with food i_am unfamiliar with
my_experience here was_pleasant
service_was_quick and we_were_seated promptly
my so and_i came_on a_quiet afternoon after he stated he_was craving_some indian_food
there were_only about other_people in_the_restaurant so it_was_pretty quiet
i_had_no clue what_the chutney_was for
and_i_didn't like_the aftertaste of papadum
just in_general
so_i just waited_for my_order for the_tikka_masala_and mango_lassi
the_naan_and my mango_lassi came first
the_latter being very_delicious
i_don't_like the_taste_of naan
but_their tikka_masala_and_the rice were_excellent
the_chicken was_tender_and i_couldn't get_enough
so as far_as service_and the_quality_of_the_food i_ordered
i_was_very satisfied
i_went_to taj on_friday driving all_the_way from middleton to way with_my friends_who work at uw
when_i stepped inside the_restaurant i_can barely see any customers
we_went_for_the buffet_and_it_was horrible
all_the_dishes seems_to be horrible they didn't_look fresh at_all
only_thing_i liked is samosa which seems_to be freshly made
i_went_to dhaba
minerva and swagat on west_side and taj seems_to the_worst of_all
i_will_never goto this_place_and wouldn't recommend_to my_friends
stay away from this_restaurant
maharaja is my_favorite_place in_madison for_indian_food
ok
now i'll tell you why
maharaja produces some_of_the highest quality_and most consistently good_food in_madison
the_lunch_buffet can_be_a_bit spotty
but the_last two_times i've been_there the_selection_was plentiful and_tasty
dining there or for_take_out
the_food_is the_same
i've never been unpleasantly surprised_by the_quality_of_the_food
i_have made_it a_point to try_a_new dish on_a_regular_basis
i_have_yet_to find a_curry
with or without meat
that failed to please me
the aroma of_the_food_is what draws me_in
my most frequent comment about_the_food is_that
it's_like eating flowers
you_can smell as_well as taste the_various spices_in the_curries and_other dishes_at maharaja
the_atmosphere of_the_restaurant is_a_bit odd
it_looks_like it used_to_be_a 's or 's supper club
not_exactly what you_would_expect for_an_indian_restaurant
the_service_is_very good
the waiters_are courteous_and attentive
they_don't hover yet i_don't_have to_go looking_for them when_i need something
the_weekend lunch_buffet is_one_of the_best_i've_ever seen
huge selection_of really_tasty indian_food
the_menu also delves into southern indian_cuisine which i've never seen elsewhere
the_servers actually care whether you're happy_and do a_good job
like others_have mentioned
the_atmosphere_is a_little bizarre but_the very diverse crowd usually dining there makes_it feel like_a 'big city' restaurant
one_of_my_favorites in_madison
did_i_mention that_its cheap
we missed the_lunch_buffet that_we_had heard so_much about and_went right to_dinner
we_ordered six dishes for_three adults and_one kid
the_food_was_fantastic and_flavorful
though_the kid who_was with_us was_very unimpressed with the_exception of the_mango_lassi
the_big surprise came at_the_end when_we_got the_bill and_it_was over dollars
yowzers
while the_food_was_good
there_wasn't_a whole lot_of it
so the_bill was_a_bit shocking
but don't_let_the cost of dinner detour you if_you_are looking_for excellent_indian_food
this_place_has got_it
so go early and hit the_lunch_buffet instead
this_place_is unreal
i_had lunch there yesterday on_the recommendation of_these reviews
it was_better_than i'd hoped
all_of_the_food on_the_buffet was_fresh
hot and_tasty
service_was_very_good as_well we'll definitely be_back_again
and_again
i'm a_huge_fan_of this_place
this_is serious tandoori goodness
their tikka_masala_is amazing too
you_know
i_am usually highly suspicious of_buffets
i_took microbiology in college
and_really
it_was enough_to scare me_away from buffets forever
i'd almost rather eat off_a toilet seat than a_buffet
that being_said
the buffet_at maharaja rules
i_really always thought_i hated indian_food
because i_don't_like curry
i_usually stick_to tandoori_chicken_and the_bread
last_time_i went
i_got
adventurous
and_tried the_tikka_masala
yum
i_also love those little balls soaked in syrup
so
i_tried other_things too
like little veggie fritters and palak_paneer
i_am also now addicted to mango_lassis
the staff_is_very_friendly
and thankfully
keeps the_buffet fresh
this_is_one buffet i_can't_wait_to come_back_to
i_moved into_the madison area just last_week
and_after hearing rumors about_the spectacular lunch_buffet_at the_maharaja
i_needed to_try_it for_myself
suffice it to_say_that i_was_in no_way disappointed
i showed up_to_the restaurant at
this afternoon
with_an entire minutes_to spare before the_buffet officially closed
even so
the_hot food_was_still hot
the_cold food cold
and_absolutely everything_was extraordinarily delicious
and_i_would know of_course i_had_to_try a_bit_of it_all
the_waiters themselves were very_polite_and attentive
which_i generally do_not expect at anything_that even resembles a_buffet not_to_mention when someone shows up minutes_before the_meal should be over
all in_all
this experience alone was enough_to inspire delight in my_new wisconsin home
i_look_forward_to finding the many_other edible treasures that madison surely has_to_offer
but_i_will most certainly_be passing up more_than_a few meal opportunities to_come_back to_this wonderful downtown diner
the_new madisonian
p
s
they've also_got free wireless
oh_yeah
maharaja's lunch_buffet is_very_good offering a_lot_of options at a_great_price
i_have_been a_couple_of_times when the_food_was not_as_good_as at_other times
but_all in_all a_good_place_to eat
and you_have_to have_their chai_tea
i've never been_to_india or had chai_tea other_than at american places
but_this tasted authentic_and very_yummy
the_buffet was_very_good_and had a_huge selection
even_for a_vegetarian
there_is_an entire dessert table
with half a_dozen to_choose_from
i_do however like_indian_food to be_a_bit spicier
the_restaurant_is huge_and it_is_good for large groups
the_best_indian_buffet out_there
excellent value_for your money
the_service_is outstanding as_well
many_of_the employees recognize and remember regular customers
an altogether memorable experience
every_time
peter
who_is indian by ethnicity
and gets out_there when homesick
or_just sick of home food
i_stopped in_for_dinner while_i_was in_madison for training
now i_must_say
i_am_a sucker for indian_buffets
i_love them_all
even_if i_don't_know the_name_of any_of_the dishes
so it_was_a feat that on_this night
it_was the_first_time_i was_actually picking out individual entrees
i_read the takeout menu about times until i_saw a_couple_of things_that looked familiar
i_felt_like a nervous little school boy taking my_first test
finally i_just went up_to_the waiter at_the desk and_asked_for his recommendations
a_few_minutes later
chicken_tikka_masala
nan_and samosas_were ordered
then the_waiter gave_me crayons and_a coloring book and told_me to_go play
just kidding
the_food turned_out_to be really_good
samosas_were really flavorful and_not_too greasy
it went well_with_the sauces that_were provided green mint
sweet diced tomato and_a plum
sauce
nan_was on par
with_the high recommendation of the_chicken_tikka_masala
i_expected to_be knocked out
instead i just_got pimp slapped across_the face
it_was_still good_but_not star good
overall
this_was_a definite good find
i_will surely update my_review once_i hit up the_lunch_buffet
excellent weekend_buffet best assortment_of high_quality food i_have_seen in an_indian_buffet and_very reasonable_price
i_highly_recommend_this to_everyone
i_am_a believer
i finally_got to_try_the_buffet
let me_tell you
if eating until it hurts is wrong
i_don't_want_to be right
they_had all_the staples
tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
as_well as_some new items i've never tasted
chicken_was the_most notable kinda like crunchy bite size pieces_of tandoori_chicken
except spicier
dessert didn't dissapoint either
there_were at least you_could pick from
the_most notable were the_mango_ice_cream and carrot_halwa
note
lack_of samosas_and palak
spinach
paneer didn't push my rating to_a
there_is hope
however
i_did go on_a_thursday for_the_lunch_buffet
the_weekend buffet_is supposed_to have_more offerings
both_dishes that i_was_able_to try were_pretty mediocre
i_had_a curry_dish and_the llamb was_tender
but the_sauce_was really average
my_husband_had lamb kebab and didn't_even finish half_of it
the_best_thing we_had_was the peshwari_naan
but_overall we wouldn't_go again
one_of_the best restaurants_in_madison
the_buffet_is amazing and_the_service_is consistently top_notch
they_have_some standard dishes on_the_buffet but_also rotate through specials
especially on_weekends
i've_never_had something bad
it_is refreshed often and
as_someone else has already mentioned
hot food_is_always hot_and cold food_is_always cold
my_favorite_dishes
aloo_gobi
aloo chole
and mutter_paneer
i_love that_they have_a_full range_of items from nice crispy appetizers through to a_great dessert selection
i_think_the gulab_jamun is_probably my_favorite but_the semolina cake is_also fabulous
and the_mango_ice_cream
i_highly_recommend going for_lunch_and skipping breakfast and_dinner
d
i'm afraid i've never ordered off_the_menu or been there_for_dinner so_i_can't comment on_that
the_price_of the_buffet_is fantastic
especially given that_you_get to_try so_many tasty dishes
so i've never been tempted to_try_the menu
easily my_favorite restaurant_in_madison
very_attentive waitstaff
i've_never_had a_dish here_that i_didn't_like
i_went_here once
and i_was_very_impressed
i'm_not the_biggest fan_of_indian_food
prefer thai
but_they may be turning me
too_bad it's on the_west_side
known at best_indian in_madison
no much on atmosphere perhaps but crazy good_food
the_service_is_great very_nice staff
the_food_is okay probably some_of_the best in_madison
but_not excellent
we_usually get the_chicken_makhani which is_the_best dish we've found
the_tikka_masala is alright not_great
the_naan_and paratha are_good
i_am_a sucker for buffets
indian_buffets take_it to a_whole nother level
i_have_been_here before for_a
work
trip
last_visit
i_was probably hungrier than_this past one
but_i digress
maharaja had all_the_indian bites that_i crave sag paneer
chicken_masala
samosas mmmmmmm
they_also_had some pieces i_was not_familiar_with chicken
ok
and_since when is general tsao's chicken considered indian
whatever
i'll eat_it
all dishes_were pretty_good
but_since we_were_there towards the_end_of_the buffet
the_chicken dishes_were a_little_on_the dry side
the_desserts however
were enough_to keep_me coming_back_for more literally
pistachio ice_cream
mango_ice_cream
pudding type thing
sweet donut hole
done
definitely would want to_go_back here_when in_the_area
muy rico
is good_food
good_flavor and_different
the_service_is_good and_very politte
very_good desserts
the_restaurant_was clean
the_staff pleasant
the_food_was_a little bland for_my_taste
perhaps they_were catering to_a more mainstream crowd but_i prefer my indian_dishes to_have_a little kick_to them
especially the_saag_paneer
they_didn't_have as large a_selection as i'm_used_to at the_indian_restaurants_in los angeles
i_won't totally discredit them
but couldn't offer up stars either
i'd say give_them_a try_and see_what you_think
about years_ago i_tried an_indian_buffet restaurant
in_a different state and_not related to_this_restaurant
i disliked the_food so_much_that it's taken me_that long_to even try_indian_food again_and boy am_i glad i_was_able_to try_again here_at maharaja's restaurant
we were_looking_for
something different
to_eat on_a late sunday_night they_are_open daily until_pm
we_were a_party_of four consisting of_two middle aged adults with_our
kids
age and
if_you're_in_the mood for_something quicker they_also offer a_lunch_buffet daily
the_atmosphere_was beautiful chandeliers
white tableclothes
candles on_the tabletops
authentic yet subtle indian_music played softly in_the_background
the_waiter put_the napkins into_our laps very classy
before we_went i_had looked over_the online menu
great descriptions and pictures
so_i already had_some idea of_what_i wanted which_made it easier than guessing in person
our_waiter was_very_helpful in advising my year old daughter on_what dish she might enjoy
my_son is a_vegetarian and_was impressed_by the_selection the_rest_of us are_not vegetarians and_we_were also impressed_by the_selection
we_would call this_food
cruise quality
back_when that_really meant something_that is
it_was_awesome and out_of_this_world great
we_all took turns sampling each other's meals
which_were served_in individual serving bowls
the_dishes_we ate were
beverages
mango shakes
very unusual and_refreshing especially after_a spicy bite of_something
and masala tea
sweet hot tea drink very similar_to chai
fresh glasses_of ice water were automatically given and refreshed frequently
appetizers
complimentary
daal poori
fried lentil bread
think_of this kind of_like tortilla chips in_a mexican restaurant crispy but_with a_different
but very_tasty
flavor
this_was served_with three different_types_of dipping_sauces
pickles these_are not any ordinary 'pickles
' this_was very salty_and unusually flavored with_spices like corriander and chili powder
we_were_told some_of_the ingredients included vegetables
green mango chunks
and_some type_of indian fruit
the piece i_ate reminded me somewhat of olives only saltier and stranger
unfortunately most of_us did_not appreciate this_dish but the_good news is it_only cost
to_try_it
very salty_and somewhat spicy
cheese pakora flat cheese that has_been breaded and fried tasty though reminiscent_of tofu and_or fried_chicken
not_spicy
samosas spicy turnovers stuffed with_potatoes and_green peas mixed reviews the men in our_party enjoyed them more_than the women did
yes they were_a_bit spicy
soups
s
o
had_the mulligatawny soup it's made_with lentils_and vegetables_and has_an unusual spicy flavor_and topped with a_bit_of cilantro
very_good with_the lemon squeezed into_it
i_felt it_was somewhat reminiscent_of a granular pea soup
it had_a_little kick_to it
somewhat spicy
the_three others of_us_had coconut soup sweet_and creamy warm soup with shredded coconut and pistachios
daughter felt it
reminded her of christmas
i_think perhaps it reminded her of eggnog in_a way similar comfort level but different taste
sweet not_spicy
for breads we_tried plain paratha
similar_to a thick wheat tortilla
and the_garlic_nan it_was extra super garlicky and_tasty
neither spicy
our_meals were_served_with a_large bowl_of long grained rice for_us all to_share
we_were given a_choice_of spice_levels from mild to hot
beef jalfrazie
beef curry_with various vegetables
chicken_tiki madras
tomato curry base with coconut from southern india
vegetable_curry
stir fried medley with curry_sauce
and_i indulged myself in_a decadent special of_the_day
tandoori lobster
spiced lobster tail cooked_in_a high heat pressure type cooker called a tandoor oven
we_all tried each other's dishes_and each was enjoyed by all
my
mostly
vegetarian son even snuck in_a bite of lobster
none_of_the entrees seemed too_spicy_for us
even_though_we were stuffed_and had_leftovers we knew_we
had_to
have desert
daughter opted_for_the gulab_jamun
also called 'waffle balls'
sweet fried dough balls covered_in a rosewater syrup
was reminiscent_of perhaps pancakes with syup or cobbler but of_course with_a different flavor
we_were very_impressed_with the kulfi a_sweet custard like ice_cream made_with pistachios and almonds
the_staff_was_very_friendly and kind answered all_of our questions with patience and care
helping us throughout the_evening to_get_the best meal possible
to_top the_evening off the_waiter_brought us all hot damp washclothes for_our hands
what exemplary service_and attention
dinner_for the four_of us came_to a_bit over plus a tip which seems very_reasonable for_the_amount_of_food we_ate plus leftovers
fit for royalty
i_highly_recommend majaraja restaurant anytime
i soooo didn't_want_to eat_here but was_kind_of peer pressured into_it
i_was_really afraid of_what_i would_get at_a wisconsin indian_restaurant next_to a hotel
i_was_happy to_be proven wrong
this_was_one_of_the_best indian_restaurants i_have_been_to
there_were awards all_over_the walls that showed just how awesome everyone else thinks maharaja is as_well
i split_a samosa
the_chicken
an_order_of keema nan_and lamb moghlai with the_bf
the_appetizers were_all good_but_not worth finishing
what was_amazing was_the keema nan and_the_lamb
i_mean they_were out_of_this_world delicious
the_lamb could_have_been_a little spicier but_that_was our fault since_we_were being little chickens and_didn't say to_make_it spicy
i_would_definitely_recommend_this restaurant to_anyone_who finds themselves in_madison and searching_for something exciting and_delicious to_eat
madison wisconsin is_not_a place one_would figure for great_indian_food
but there_are_some serious gems here
i_love_this_place
after_a day_of shopping or a_cheap movie
we often found ourselves here_for_dinner
the_service_is_great
they_put our napkins on_our laps and brought_us the_warm towel after_dinner
our_water was_never left unfilled
and they_even chased me down_with my coat once
i love_the_food
its so_good it's_hard_to stop_eating it
my_boyfriend loves meat and_i_am a_vegetarian
we_both were pleased here_and that_can_be hard_to accomplish
we_were always welcomed and fed well at_a reasonable_price
if_you_are near odana and hungry
try it_out
fantastic_food
really excellent
my_only suggestion for the_restaurant
please serve red_wine in red_wine glasses
otherwise a_star
fantastic_food
really excellent
my_only suggestion for the_restaurant
please serve red_wine in red_wine glasses
otherwise a_star
im not_indian
but_i've tried really good_indian_food and_this_place_is pretty_good
i_always_get_the the two_dishes that_can never go_wrong which_is_the chicken_tikka_masala_and_the tandoori_chicken
sorry if_i spelled that incorrectly
anyways this_place also_has really_good rice
its actually flavored
overall my_favorite place_to_eat in_madison so_far
i_love_this_place
nice and_very_friendly staff
my_sister is a_regular
and i_would_be if_i_lived on the_west_side
if you're craving_indian and_do not_know what_to_order
the_lunch_buffet_is where it's at
i'm one of_those picky types
where decisions are difficult for_me
so a_buffet is_perfect
plus
if_you're_not familiar_with_indian_food
then it_would no fun if you chose something from_the_menu and ended up not liking it
and_this_place crushes all stereotypes of a_buffet
it always is_clean
the_food_is_always fresh
no crunchy rice
and they_serve a_wonderful variety_of_dishes
chicken_masala is_my_favorite with the_vegetable fritters
and they_always bring the_naan out right away
and_it's so warm
mmm
just what you_need on_a cold day
cheap too
i_always leave stuffed_and ready for_a nap
love the_lunch_buffet
i_probably go once_a_week
but_the dinners are_great too
and_you definitely get a_lot_of_food with each order
the_restaurant_is never very crowded
and_once you_get_to know the_waiters
they_are extremely generous
and_love to_see familiar faces
love_this_place
great_buffet for_a very reasonable_price
i_wish_i_could go more often
don't_let_the empty parking_lot and smallish looking restaurant fool_you this is_some_of_the_best indian_fare
and dining_experience
you'll find in_madison
i'll admit
seeing the_place from the_outside didn't_have me convinced
but_since when did_i start going_to restaurants for_their outdoor decor
the_night of_us went_for_dinner
the_place_was empty
not another soul there
the_staff_was_very_friendly and_accommodating right_off_the bat
getting us situated with_a table_and bread before we_had_a chance to_take_our coats off
i_love free stuff
at_one point during the_evening
we_had separate folks waiting our_table
talk_about service
all very_friendly
trying_to be helpful_and clear things quickly
i_didn't order a_drink like my_other two compadres
but_the_staff brought out chai for_me
without asking
on_the house
it_was phenomenal
and free
they_had me_at
on_the house
down to_the_food everything_was incredibly flavorful
our_table had chicken_dishes
curry
veg dish
and sides of nan
the_chicken_was done perfectly and melted in_your_mouth
portions_are plenty big
we_ate more_than we should
in_short
these_guys know what they're doing
go
i wanna gonna give_stars because the_food_was_excellent but_the_service_was terrible
so minus one_star for_that
the_place_was crowded and they_didn't_have enough waiters
when_i asked_the_waiter to_take_a photo of_me with_the_food
he said ok and_never came_back
when_i_asked for the_bill
the_waiter forgot
i_ordered wine_and they_never brought_it
i_had_to remind them that_i_had ordered wine
the_food
however
was_excellent
the_daal was_very_tasty
and_the_chicken_tikka makni was_amazing
the_mixed tandoori platter seemed really popular
i_saw many_people order plate after plate_of meat on_a sizzling hot plate
so_i_ordered it_too and_it_was so_tender
you_get chicken
shrimp and beef
bottomline
come_here when it_is_not crowded
i_love_the indian_buffet
only on_weekends and_it cost bucks
so very_reasonably_priced
tandoori_chicken_and naan is_very_good
i_still love_the_food here
but frankly we most often eat_at_the east_side location
i_recently had_a http
restaurant
com certificate for this_location
though
so_we made_the trek over
i_was_not pleased with the_way my certificate was handled they shorted the credit by a_few dollars
and_when challenged
had_some goofy excuse
not_sure how
but three reasonable adults still racked up_a bill over before tip and_after a_coupon
i_also didn't_like that_the gin and tonic i_ordered was each for rail gin
wow this_place_is_amazing
i seriously could_not stop_eating
buffet variety is_excellent
taste_is average by indian_food stds
good
authentic_indian_food
thanks yelp for helping us find_it
i've_only had_indian_food on a_few occasions
and_most_of it_was either homemade by friends or limited to appetizers
i was_excited_to_try maharaja because i_had_heard good_things and it_would_be a_new experience
they for_sure do_not disappoint
we_walked_in to a_quiet restaurant_with only_a_few patrons for_a_late dinner
and were_greeted by polite hosts
servers
etc
upon seating us
they pulled the chair out for_my fiance and set her napkin which i_thought_was a_nice_touch
we mentioned to the_server that_it_was our_first_time there and_asked_for some recommendations and he_was_very responsive
he_suggested an_appetizer
the_samosa
which was_absolutely_delicious
he_also recommended that_for our_meals we try_the mixed_grill and_the tikki_masala chicken with_garlic nan_bread
and_to throw a_little sweet into_the mix with_a_mango milkshake smoothy
we_did all_of_the above and it_was_fantastic
other waiters_were prompt on getting us water
and there_was_only about_minutes between_the appetizers_and the_meal which_was a_good_amount_of time to_let things settle
we_also_had some bread crisps with_three different kinds_of chutney to_sample while we_waited
overall
one_of_the best experiences i've_had_in madison at a_restaurant
i_highly_recommend
i'm_going back soon to_try_their lunch_buffet as it_looks_like the_same food albeit at_a more affordable price
dinner entrees_are normally in_the range
we_wanted_to try_a_new indian_restaurant_and found_this_place near west towne mall via yelp
service_was exceptional
i've been in_the_restaurant business for_over years and_they went above and beyond what_i expected for a_small family_owned business
we_came_in around pm_on_a monday night_and upon seating our_party of
the_server set our napkins for_us and made_us_feel welcomed
the_restaurant wasn't too_busy that evening so_my rating may be skewed because_of that
i_didn't give_them_a full stars because_they_were always there at_the_table or near by
i_would_suggest to_them to_be_able_to
read
the_table better and adjust their services accordingly
but_i definitely give them credit for_being courteous_and anticipating our needs
like asking if we'd like more rice
food_was_delicious
spices_were just_right without being too_spicy
the chutney's served_in the_beginning of_our_meal were_tasty as_well
we_ordered_the lamb_rogan_josh
lamb_masala
and chicken_vindaloo
the_meats were_very tender_and the_curries_were tasting light
we also_ordered chapati and_the plain_naan which_were amazing
this_was_the_best naan i've ever_had
texture was light_and airy
so soft it melted in_your_mouth
we_had mango lassi's to_drink and complimented the_spicy notes in our_food
the_lassi was not_too_sweet and_perfectly tangy
pleasantly
at_the_end_of our_meal they_brought_out clean hot towels for_us_to refresh our hands with
we had_leftovers and to_my_surprise the_next_day
the_server had put_a scoop_of rice in_the container for_us_to enjoy with_our leftover curry
we_will_definitely_be_back
thanks_to yelp we_found a_great_indian_restaurant just minutes_from our hotel
we_were_in town_for the_great taste_of_the midwest and needed some food_after several hours of beer drinking
this_place filled the_bill
we_started_with_the best samosas i_have_had large_and crispy with_a very_flavorful filling
all_of_us really_enjoyed our main_courses
i_had_a lamb_dish with tomatoes and mushrooms
husband_had chicken_tikki_masala and daughter had paneer
i_liked that_they cooked the_food_to your spice_level
we_also_had excellent naan
garlic flavor was_the_best
and basamati rice
service_was_excellent_and very prompt
we enjoy several indian_places_in the chicago area
and_this_was as_good if_not better
we have_never_had a_bad_meal here
we recently ordered_some carry_out and_it_was superb
we_ordered two_different chicken_curry dishes
the_prices_are a_bit high but we_are more_than happy to_spend more_for good_quality and maharaja delivers
the_mango_ice_cream is_delicious
the service_was_quick and_very_friendly showing interest in what_we were_doing the_day_we stopped by
the_atmosphere_is pleasant_and the_background music very_nice
all the_previous reviews are spot_on
we_loved this_restaurant
best_indian_food we've_had in_years
we_had cheese pakora
mulligatawny soup
chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori_chicken_and aloo_gobi
it_was_all delicious
but the_tandoori_chicken was_the_best
and_naan
can't forget that
would_definitely come_here again
friendly_staff
we mentioned we_were passing through and_he_said he knew_we were newcomers
the_others in_the_restaurant were regulars
some_of whom were indian
which_is always a_good_sign
stop_here for good_food
this_place_is_great
i_was_looking_for a_great_place for_dinner_with the_bf and found_this_place
we_ended_up going_there for_the_lunch_buffet
when_you first walk_in
the_place_looks a_little_on_the fancier side and_i_had jeans and t shirt on so_i sort of felt a_little under dressed
after_looking around though it_was_more that_they just_had nice_decor because everyone else seemed really casual too
their_lunch_buffet_is
and completly worth_it
everything that_i_had was_so_good and_flavorful
they_also_had so many_different varieties
i_had_the mango drink which tasted like_a fresh squeezed mango
fresh
for_dessert i_went_with mango again and_had_the mango_ice_cream
cold
that was_good_too
all in_all i_highly_recommend_this_place
it was_the_only meal me and_the man ate that_day but_it kept us full the_entire day
ooooh and the_naan_is included in_the_buffet too
not_only_is the_food great
but_the_staff always treats us like royalty
i go_in with_my three young kids
by myself or to_meet friends_for lunch
we_are always greeted like old friends
my kids love the_chicken_tiki_masala
vegetable balls and mulligatawny soup all mild
i_love the_aloo gobhi and_their lovely fried cauliflower in_the sweet red sauce
among many_other things
their_chai is warming and_good just_the_right_amount_of sweetness and_spice
very family friendly
the_lunch_buffet has_a_great variety_of_food
wow
this_place made_me love_indian_food
i_had three entrees with_my_husband and_all were_good
i_can't_wait_to_go for_the_lunch_buffet to_try different_things
the_staff_was_friendly and_the_place_was clean_and well pressed
this_is_one_of those mediocre indian_restaurants that reek of complacency in just_about everything they_serve
i_feel sorry for residents of madison because there_isn't a_single good_indian_restaurant_in this city so_they obviously don't know what they_are missing out_on
fortunately hours away in_the_city of chicago you_have the_best_indian_restaurants_in the_country and cheap too
thank god for_that
the_meat here isn't the_best quality_and definitely_not fresh
its frozen chicken
the_biryani is_a joke and more_like_a pulao
service_is slow but_what will shock you the_most are the_prices
wayyy overpriced_for the mediocrity they dish out
any_indian_restaurant worth its salt that_serves classic non vegetarian_food will_not have south_indian_cuisine on the_same menu
that to_me was_a dead giveaway that food_here_was not_going_to be_good and was_i right
after_dinner they_were thoughtful to_serve hot towelettes to wipe our hands with but_one whiff and you_could literally smell the dirty water they_were washed in
absolutely terrible experience
will_not_go here_again
they_are_so great
the_staff_is super_friendly at both the_east and west_side locations
the_lunch_buffet_for
amazing
the_west_side location_is cuter
more niche
but_i_am a_fan_of both
the_food_is_amazing
definitely get_the bang for_your buck
will_definitely be_back
time_and time again
went here_for_the_first_time while_visiting a_friend
and_i_must_say this_place_is pretty_good
i'm a_fan_of_indian_food by far
and_this_place rocked
the_only gripe i_had_was that they_had_a batch of_basmati_rice on_the_buffet for_a_while and_when_i put it_on_the plate it_was_too crunchy
i told_them about_it
and thy immediately put_out another pot of_rice which_was fresh
the_mango_ice_cream was_out_of_this_world
i like_this_place
and_would return
i_absolutely_love this_place
the_staff_is_friendly_and the_food_is_delicious
the buffets_are great_and so_is any food_you order_off_the_menu
i_have_never_had a_bad_meal here_before
every_time_we are in_madison
we stop_by and_have lunch_or_dinner or take an_order out
we_are seriously going_to miss maharaja's now_that we've moved_to south florida
no indian_food lives up to_this_place
i've had_better_indian_food once or twice but_it has_always been_in bigger cities and has_been much_more expensive
the_food_is_great and i_highly_recommend_the buffet
i_have_never found an_indian_place that match the_quality at_this value
fantastic
you gotta go_for_the buffet_so you_can_try a_little_bit_of_everything
the_paneer is_the_best
the_staff_is super_nice too
my_second indian_food experience
and it_was_not had_the_lunch_buffet
good_food
good_price
you_walk into the_restaurant_and the_buffet looks really_delicious with_an overwhelming variety
the highlights were the_mango_ice_cream
grilled fish
vegetable_pakora and_the homemade chutneys
the_service_was very_friendly_and_attentive
the_food_is all way_too mild
there should be
at least
one_dish in_an_indian_restaurant that threatens to burn your_face off
the_dishes all look good but_they left_me very unsatisfied
in_addition
all_of_the dishes seemed_to be off temperature
it_wasn't_bad
but i_am_not ovewhelmed
the_chicken_tika masala_was tough
the_sauce_was not thick enough and_was
as_i mentioned earlier
way_too mild
i_have_a hunch
had i_ordered off of_the_menu
the_food would_have_been much better
the_bread_was more_like pita and less like naan and_that's a_shame because_the bread_is very important to_me
for_an_indian meal
there_was_a cabbage dish_that verged on being fantastic
i_probably will not_have_a sunday_afternoon craving for_this_place
in_the_end
i_found a_few items_that i_liked
and i_would_probably give them another shot
this is_my_first less than stellar review on_yelp
but the_last_time_i went_here
nobody was satisfied
we_have_been before for_the_buffet
which if_i remember well was pretty_decent
so we_went_for_dinner when my_parents and brother visited me in_madison
i_don't_remember exactly_what_i got
but_it_was_a vegan dish with_peas as a_star
what_i do remember is how very_bland it_tasted
i'm no expert
but_i'm also no stranger to_indian_food
the_spicy tomato y sauce that_is_a base part_of many_dishes was water y and lacked flavor
i_even ordered_it
medium
my_family all had similar complaints
though they_all tasted mine and agreed that_it_was the_worst of_the four
i t was_very unfortunate because i_love_indian_food
and_i_love peas
and_i_have generally liked_the two in_madison
but_this fell very short
i_have_eaten in indian_places all_over_the country and_this_place ranks up_there with_one of_the_worst
the_wait_staff_is nice
the_water stayed full
but_the_food_is dead avg at_best
one_of_the reasons i_love_indian_food is_the depth of_flavor
last_night i_had_to salt the lamb_dish b c it_was_so flat
we_have left_overs which_is usually a_hot commodity for_lunch_the_next_day
neither one of_us have touched them
i've just moved_to madison and_this_is my first_time_here
but_i_don't envision returning anytime soon
for madison
for chicago
so either way it's about as_good_as_it gets for_indian_food here
we_first went_to_the one_in milwaukee
then moved_here
and_found out_the place_in milwaukee
which we_thought was_awesome
had_more here
yay
so we've eaten_here a_bunch_of times
usually carry_out
nice portions
the_price isn't too_bad for_indian
which from my_experience tends_to be high priced
low portions compared_to other cuisine
we_love_the tandoori_chicken
the curry_sauce which_comes with_it
good basmati as_well
hard_to make that_bad
we_love_the veggie appetizer plate
which includes samosa which is_very_good
and others
we like_all of_them
probably the_least favorite_is_the cheese thing
pakora is_great
we_love_the breads
we_order on_the side
stuffed naans
prathas
etc
all in_all great_indian_food for anywhere
still could find better in a_larger city like chicago
nyc
or la
but_this_is bumble f
wi
so be_happy there_is some decent_indian_food
p
s
also ate_the buffet_lunch one_time
and it_was_a_very good_value
plus you get_to_try a_whole bunch_of different_things you might_not normally get to_have
i_suggest going at_some_point
i_ordered through
straight your door
when staying at_a hotel in middleton
wi
i_had_the chicken_biryani and_it_was_delicious
more chicken than_in any_other biryani i_have_had
and_i_have eaten_in many_indian_restaurants across the_country
i_would_definitely order_from here_again
best goat i've ever_had
ok
yes this_is the_first_time i've_had goat
but_i_have had_a_lot_of indian_food_before and_this_was so_good
i_absolutely had to_order_the cheese nan for an_appetizer
it arrived_in about_minutes after_ordering
which_was fine since_i nommed on some_of_the crackers with cilantro mint relish while_i waited
the_nan came_with four pieces with_a mild cheese on tip
which_was absolutely scrumdilliumptious
for my_entree i wanted_to_go a_little crazy
so_i_ordered the_goat malabar
i_was_a_little frightened
never_eaten goat before
but_i_was super surprised and excited that_it_was tender
flavorful_and totally awesome
i_ordered_it mild_and it packed quite_a punch
i_love that you_can_order different spiciness levels
super plus
they_have_a_great selection_of_indian beer too which_was fun to_try
i_ordered_the flying horse
which_was_a light_and refreshing ale that cut the_heat of_the spicy_dishes
the gentlemen working were very_polite
they pulled out_my chair and placed a napkin in_my lap
i_felt_like an_indian princess
the_only con was_that_the decor was_a_bit dated
with_a 's feel
the carpet was old_and dingy and_they_had fake flowers on_the tables which_were rapidly collecting dust
not romantic
however
the_wait_staff_was always willing to_come and fill up water_and ask_us how_we were_doing
it_felt nice to_be taken_care of
i'll definitely_come again_and order_something else adventurous
excellent chicken_vindaloo
great tea
nice service
beautiful presentation
good_place
very_reasonable
best_indian in_madison
this_is_my happy place
the_dining_room is_always filled_with other happy madisonians mowing on_indian
maharaja do_it
and be_sure_to order the_masala tea
the_lunch_buffet_is great_for_a group or just_a_couple
the_food_is wonderful_and consistent
if you always wanted_to try_indian_food but are afraid you'll order_something and_not like_it
fear no_more
the_buffet_is a_wonderful way_to_try a myriad of representatives of_this fine international cuisine
this_is_a favorite of my_family_and my coworkers
and_i work with_a_large number_of indian citizens
best_indian in_madison
i've been coming_here_for the_past couple years the_food_is superb and_only surpassed by the_service
on just my second_visit
the_manager recognized me_and took_the effort to_have_a conversation
learn my name
etc
he's friendly every_time_i come_in
treats me like a_regular even_if i_haven't_been around in a_couple months
he truly makes sure_we have_a_great dining_experience and_it's not_just me
all customers seem_to get similar treatment
the_food_itself
i_could go_on forever just try_it yourself
my favorites_are the_lamb_vindaloo
madras
goat malabar
chicken_saag
you can't_go_wrong
oh_and the_weekend buffets_are a_great_way_to try a_bunch_of delicious things too
delicious
we_ordered dinner take_out
the_tikka_masala_and aloo ghobi
both_of which were_fantastic
naan delicious as_well
priced the_same_as all_the_other indian around
will_be_going back
incredible
seriously
i_live in_an area with_a_large indian population
and_with really_great places to_eat
i_went_to_this restaurant while in_madison on business
i_was floored
everything from_the papadam and_chutneys to the_masala tea at_the_end was_delicious
i had_the_lamb_vindaloo
hot
the gravy was thick_and spicy
and the_lamb_was_tender
naan was_perfect
for desert masala tea_and gulab_jamun
both_were outstanding
service_was_attentive
friendly
and_we_were provided with scented hot cloths to clean after_eating
my only_wish was_that they_served their_dishes thali
but_i left so stuffed that i_really didn't need it
if_you_are_in madison and like_indian_food you_must give them your business
you_will_not_be_disappointed
the_beginning of brought many resolutions my_way
all_of which_i have kept thus far
thank_you very_much
one of_those said resolutions was_to try_indian_food
wow
have i been missing out
i_am a_fan_of heat_and spice
i_find myself trying to_find_the next hotter sauce spice
while i_am_not_sure what_it_was
i_think i_found_it
i_found my breaking point in hot sauces
that alone will bring me back somewhere
having gone on_a_friday with_a_group_of woman from work
i_really had_no_idea what_i_was getting myself into for_the_lunch_buffet
but_i decided
heck
i'll_try it
worst case scenario i_am out
plus
i_figured i_had the_chance_to just try small bites of_something i_have_never_had before
everything_was warm hot_and nothing_was sitting_out for too_long
i_wish_i_could tell you everything_i ate
but_the two_things that_really stood out for_me were_the tikka_masala_and_the sausage made_with lamb
which should really say a_lot coming_from someone who_is a faux vegetarian
the_only_thing_that brings down_my rating is the_decor
i_felt_like i_was walking_into a 's banquet hall
besides that
the_staff_was incredibly kind and_helpful
especially when_i started_to cry from whatever spoonful of hot_sauce i foolishly poured down_my throat
will_i be_back
you betcha
will_i eat whatever magical sauce i_ate that_day
darn right
will i_get_the buffet
no
because_i like myself_and like to_be_able_to breathe after i_am done eating
better_than swagat on old sauk for_sure
and possibly better_than taste_of_india on monroe
we_came_here for_a_late lunch_buffet on_a_sunday
and_we practically had the_place_to ourselves
there_was_a huge variety_of foods on_the_buffet
with about_a split of meaty vs
vegetarian_options
most_of_the items weren't super_spicy
which i'm_sure they_have to_do on_the_buffet to_meet most people's preferences
they_bring naan to_your_table
and_it_is excellent
tender yet chewy
and slightly buttery
yum
also
don't miss the_mango_ice_cream
it_is incredibly delicious and_refreshing
this is_fabulous food
and_the_service_is wonderful
woe is me
what took_me so_long to discover this_place
and to_think
all_the times that_i've craved indian_food
maharaja was_just_a short drive away
my_friend_and_i ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
mild
the_fish_curry
medium
and_the regular_naan
our_entrees came with_a_side_of rice_and_a complementary flatbread appetizer served_with tamarind_sauce and_two types_of chutney
onion_and cilantro
while the_portions_are small
the_food_is_very filling probably on account of_all_the carbs
p
as_for our_dishes
the_chicken was_a_little tough
but_otherwise well_seasoned
i_really_enjoyed_the creamy tomato base
and_i_was glad_that i_ordered_it mild instead_of medium because_the medium fish_curry was really_spicy
i_was a_huge_fan_of the battered catfish cooked_in_a garlic ginger sauce
but_i could_only take so_much heat
service_was impeccable
our water_glasses_were always filled quickly_and plates were cleared off the_table as_soon_as_we were_done with_them
the_staff continually circulated by to_see_how we_were enjoying the_meal_and seemed genuinely interested in_any feedback we_had about_our dining_experience
just an fyi
the online menu is_a_little outdated
i_wanted_to order the_chana_masala but_it_wasn't an option on_the restaurant menu
fortunately
you_really can't_go_wrong_with any_of_the curries or masalas
give 'em a_try
if_the important things_about buffets_are the_quality_and variety_of_food stuffs
this_place definitely has the_latter
i_couldn't help but try nearly everything
plates_and dessert bowls later
i successfully gathered my parts together in time to_write this_review before falling into_a very_long nap
there_was_an appetizer table_with fried goodies
chicken_cooked at least different ways
delicious veggie_options
a soup bar
and a_dessert table
probably different chutneys
i cried with delight when_i spotted the idli and coconut_chutney
and dosai with sambar
seeing as those are_some of_my_favorite_indian food_items
it_was hard_to hold back
late sunday after noon
customers were_still filing in_on the_regular
a_wide range_of people_were dining here
from couples to families to large groups of students
it seems_like they_have plenty of regulars and a_very diverse crowd at_that
m f
for_the_lunch_buffet
and_sat sun will set you back
laterzzzzzzz
i_would_not recommend_this_restaurant to_anyone for_one reason
pathetic customer_service
they_really don't_care about their_customers as they_know they_are one_of_the very few_indian restaurants_in_madison
food_is_very ordinary and_they cheat on_their timings
they mention they_are_open till
but stop taking people_and orders by
let them rather put they_are_open only until
they_need to learn proper business etiquette
people come_for food_and they_just turn them down without any_kind_of considerations
i_hope we_get better restaurant_in_madison and_we avoid going_there
the_best goat_curry_and kulfi
yum yum_yum
i_was_in town_for business_and i_used yelp to_find_a good_indian restuarant
i_enjoyed this_place_and if_i find myself in_madison again
i_would_definitely_go back
the_atmosphere
sort of dark in_the_restaurant but_it_was well maintained and_had_a typical
indian_restaurant
type decor
there_was indian music_playing but_it_was not_too loud
the_service
the_service_was_very attentive
my_water_glass did_not go empty
my food_arrived very quickly
almost too quickly as_i_had just been served the crackers with sauces chutneys
several different waiters_were working together to ensure that_everything a diner could want was_there
the_food
very_good
i_ordered_the lamb_vindaloo_and asked_for_it
hot
often when_i_go to indian_restaurants_and say
hot
they_actually serve it sort of medium
this was_pretty hot_and my nose was running a_bit and_i drank a_lot_of ice water as_well
i_also_ordered a_naan
with pistachios and raisins
and a_mango_lassi to_drink
i_thought_it_was all quite_good
the_only_thing wrong was_that some_of_the rice was_a_bit tough and_hard
i'm_sure they_would_have brought_me more rice but_i_just picked around it
the_amount_of_food was plentiful and_i_could only eat about_half
when_i_was finished with my_meal the_water brought_me a_small dish_of mango_ice_cream
it_was_a_little icy but_i_thought it_was_a_nice end to the_meal
i_think you_would be_hard pressed to_find_a better_indian restaurant_in_madison
in_fact some_of_the_best_indian_food i_have_ever_had
the_service_was_great_and the_atmosphere_was a_bit dark but cozy
maharaja is_a_great indian_buffet restaurant
you_can_try anything or everything
quality_is good
no waiting
the_atmosphere_is very utilitarian but friendly
a_great_place_to take hungry college students who want some authentic ethnic food
the_best_indian_food and wait service i've ever_had
from_the complimentary papadums to_the after_dinner hot towel
classy and very_reasonably_priced
two nan orders
two entrees
for_less_than
delicious
ok indian_buffet
you_are brought fresh_naan
ask_for more fresh
don't bother with_the soggy naan at_the_buffet
potatoes were hard
but lots_of chutneys_and chicken_dishes
the carrot_halwa was_not so_good
its better elsewhere
my_husband i_used_to love_this_place until we_had takeout one_night found_a dead roach the_bottom of_his briyani can't eat there_again
one_of_the worse indian_food_i_have_ever tried
i ordered_lamb josh and_the_lamb_was not well_cooked and lamb_biryani was_also_a big failure
who the_hell puts water chestnut in lamb_biryani
the_taste_was also terrible
will never_go_back
was_here twice in_the_last couple months
once for_a lunchtime buffet
which_was spectacular
and_most recently for a_quiet dinner_for_two
i_would_give this_place five_stars if_it weren't for_the quirky service
as_is_the case with_most establishments in_madison i've noticed lately
the_service_is often mediocre
inconsistent
or_just downright bad
unfortunately
in_this instance
maharaja was no_exception
my_dining partner and_i_were promptly greeted by a_waiter at our_table
being that the_menu_is quite extensive and wanting plenty of time_to pour over_it
i indicated my indecision and_told our_server that we_weren't in_any rush
he must've taken that_to mean to disappear for_the_next minutes
during that time
my_companion and_i_decided on_an appetizer_and i_had_some questions
feeling_like we_were stranded on_an island
i closed my menu a_couple_times as_a lifeline signal
that didn't work
frustrated
we_finally flagged someone over
i_was irritated that_i could've spent all those wasted minutes noshing while pondering my_meal selection
after a_bit_of_a communication issue over the_menu
we each put in_our individual dinner orders
my_companion relayed the_drink choice
chardonnay
plus a coke for_him
seeming confused
the_waiter attempted to clarify
i interjected with_a chuckle
well
not in_the_same glass of_course
referring to_the soda and_wine
moments later
the_waiter returned with_a wine for_me_and what appeared to_be_a watery coke for_him
it_was obvious after the_first sip
the chardonnay and coke were indeed combined
ummmm
did this just happen
again our_server remained mia
finally he returned with_my companion's entree
but_not mine
about_a third of_the_way into his meal
my_dinner finally arrived
sorry
but_that_is just_not acceptable
there_was no apology and_no indication of_the extended wait_time
our service throughout_the_meal was spotty
with intervals of more frequent attention and_drink refills
it_is important to note that_we showed up just_as they_opened at pm so the_restaurant_was not busy at_all until a_bit later into our_meal
the_food_was_very_good
and mine was nice_and_spicy as_i_had requested
perhaps this was_just_a fluke
but hopefully next_time the_quality_of_food will match the_level_of service
so i_want_to like maharaja but_i_have a_hard time doing it
i_live very_close_to the_restaurant_and it always smells delicious from the_outside
plus
how_can you beat a well_priced lunch_buffet
however
i_love_indian_food_and have had_some terrific foods in_other states and_this just doesn't stack up
their_naan isn't quite fluffy enough
not_sure they cook_it in_a tandoori
and their_food_is a_little_too one note and_a_bit on_the heavy side
i_went_to_this restaurant_on a friends recommendation
woo hoo i_was_pretty surprised with the_experience
i'm from bay_area and have_been_to many_indian_restaurants
on my_recent visit_to madison
wi i've_been_to maharaja restaurant
i_ordered for malai_kofta_and aloo parathas that also came_with_a bowl_of rice_and_a free desert
carrot_halwa
i_ordered_it over the_phone and_went to_pick_up the_food after an_hour
the_staff_were really_friendly and_have to_mention_the potions were_more_than usually i_get for_one order in bay_area
malai_kofta was_spicy_and well_made to_my taste_and i_liked the_rest_of_the food ordered that_day
over_all its a_very_good eating joint
good_service
nice food_and it_was_worth for what_i paid_for
i_will recommend_this_place_to my_friends
i_had punjabi saag_and shahi_paneer and_both_were delicious
i've_eaten at_indian_restaurants around_the_world and_this_is up_there with the_best that_i've experienced
staff very_friendly_and_attentive
right next_door_to an indian_grocery so_i expected something really_tasty and_that's what_we_got
i'll keep_it simple
you_are missing out if_you_don't try_this_place
it_has the_best_indian_food with amazing_service
all_i_can say_is the_next_time you_want_to grab food
come_here and_you_will leave happy_and stuffed
we cannot wait to_go_back
overall a_good_place
a_lot_of selections and even_had ice_cream and a_good_amount_of dessert
curry was_a_bit watered_down
but_still edible
had_the_lunch_buffet
was_probably_the most worth_it
good_service
tandoori_chicken_was delicious_with a_little_bit_of kick
the_sauce that_came_with it_wasn't impressive but not_bad
the_lamb_biryani was_very_tasty moist_and flavorful
do_not hesitate
this_is where_you want_to_eat lunch
just go_there
trust_me
i_am_an indian_food fanatic
and_this_place is_one_of_my_favorite restaurants of all_time
we_were just visiting madison for the_weekend
but maharaja lunch_buffet is_one_of_the many reasons i_will_be returning_to this great city
at_first i_was_disappointed that the_buffet did_not feature saag_paneer
my_favorite
but let me_tell you
everything_was amazing
i_am kind of glad there_was no saag_paneer because i_ended_up trying a_lot_of dishes_i had_not tried before
there_was not_one single thing_that_was not delicious
everything_was spiced perfectly
just_the_right_amount_of kick
there_was_a desert soup coconut pistachio that was_amazing
as_a_vegetarian
and_a lover of scrumptious foods
this_place_was a_delight
it_is about_minutes from downtown if_i remember correctly
nice restaurant
with_very attentive_staff
service_was_prompt and_courteous
rather large menu
with something_for everyone
i has the_paneer masala_dosa
which_came_with there sauces
coconut
a_cold tomato based one_and a_spicy bean
the_portion_was huge and_delicious
i_will_definitely_be_back
great_food_and great_place
we_had_the calamari as appetizer_and the_non veggie combination for_two_people
that's a_lot_of_food
i_think_that was_enough for_three people
service_was fantastic
maharaja was_one_of_the first restaurants i_came_to when_i first moved_to madison from long beach artesia ca
where some of_the_best_indian_restaurants_in the_country are
and maharaja shot up_to the_top_of my_list
wonderful buffet
predictably good
wonderful wait_staff
i_highly_recommend maharaja
absolutely_delicious
great_service
there just aren't words in_our vocabulary to_describe how stellar the_service_is as_well_as_the quality_of_the_food
if_you_go in_for_the_lunch_buffet you_get the_best value_for your money
we find_that dinner tends_to get on_the pricey side
but_the_service makes you_feel_like a king and_or queen
the_servers stay on_top_of your drink situation and_do everything they_can to make_you comfortable
if you catch them at_a slower time of_the_day
they_will actually bring_you a_hot towel after your_meal
we_love this_place_and recommend_it_to all_of our friends
yum yum_yum
great_lunch_buffet with_many choices and_flavors
great_for larger groups with ample space
service very_friendly
ordered kadhai paneer naan
the_paneer_was extremely hard did_not taste authentic
have_had beter
best_service i_have_had_in years
incredibly attentive
but_not_too much_so
friendly
warm and_helpful
for_those of_you who_are interested in help navigating a new_menu
i observed the_owner
providing really_nice assistance to_the adventurous and_or timid afraid of what_to_order
i learned a_few_things
and_i've_been eating_indian for decades
i_would_suggest ordering a_bit_more spicy hot than you typically go
as the_food_was_a bit_on_the mild side something i_have noticed more in_madison
food_was_delicious
particularly the shahi_paneer
staff could not_have_been more_than welcoming_and patient with_my young daughter
while she is_very laid back_and good when dining out
we_are often met with initial curtness
not this_time
i_cannot over stress the extraordinary service enough
while i_do_not expect staff to fawn over me
the attentiveness greatly enhanced the_experience and_made me_feel like_the occasion
and_i
was something extra special
i_often bring my_wife_and daughter here_for_the_lunch_buffet
the_reason i_only come_to the_buffet_is that my_daughter and_i_can experiment with mixing the_different sauces_and trying new_things since we're not very_well versed in indian_cuisine
i_don't_know nor care whether they_are authentic because everything they_have is pleasing to_my palate
wife really loves the_saag
service_is_always prompt
cave creek is such_a cute little town_and everytime i_go_to az i stop_by the town it_is_so old west
we_were wandering through and_were hungry and_saw a_sign for_indian fry_bread
yummy
so basically you_go in through_the souvenier shop and_walk through a_little alley kitchen and_there_is_a small dining_room tables or_so nothing fancy
i_was_very much like mexican_food with_the beans ect
the_bread_was really_good_and the_owner_was so_so friendly love_it
i_love_this_place
it's inside an american indian souvenier shop
just go_to_the back place your_order and sit_in their little eating area
everyone their is_friendly_and the navajo frybread is absolutely_delicious
it's huge and_hard to_finish
prices_are_very_reasonable
really_fresh mexican_food
good_prices and owner is_very_friendly
he'll fire burrito is_great
i'm from chicago but_i_have traveled to arizona many many_times
i_discovered this_place_on my_first trip and_now every_time_i vacation to arizona i_make sure i_go_to indian_village multiple_times
i_love_their tacos and_the crunchy shell is_amazing_and they taste so_fresh
i_also_like their enchiladas
the_place_is a dive but_i often find those are the_best_places
the_service_is_friendly
bart
the_owner
is wacky but_he keeps you entertained while_you wait_for your_food
i_usually browse in the_shop attached to_the_restaurant
i_can't_wait for my_next arizona vacation so_i_can go_to_indian village again
my_friend_and_i were swayed by other_reviews to_try_this restaurant
expecting a_gem in_the rough a treasure an_amazing find
we_didn't find_it here
in clarification
it didn't_taste bad
it_was_just nothing_special
i've made better at_home just by trying
the_most flavorful part_of_the_meal was_the hot_sauce on_the_table
essential
and_not just_because i_like a_little spice
and_i do mean a_little
but because_i prefer flavor to my_food especially_when i_have_a choice
the_reason i_didn't give just one_star is_because it_seemed clean and_had_a cool
hole in_the_wall
mom pop feel
there_was no
service
to_speak of it's_a
we'll cook_it and_you pick_it up_at the_window
environment
totally fine
if the_food_is_good
the_people were_very_nice
but_there_are just_so many_other places_to try_that unless the_experience is craving worthy
i'm moving along
no harm no foul
just no looking back
if_you_don't try_the navajo taco you'll never know what_you missed
i'm_not_a lover of mexican_food
but i've_never_had a_lunch i_didn't_like at indian_village
when volunteering for_the local chamber of commerce
i_always recommended this_place_and several folks came_back to thank me for_a memorable meal at_a_very inexpensive price
don't_let_the lack_of ambiance fool_you
the_food_is the_reason this_place_is_great
this_is_a_great mom_and_pop shop with great_food
i_read some_of_the_other reviews_and the_ones that gave_it low stars are ridiculous
they_were expecting something_that is_clearly not how this shop operates
also
i_think someone reviewed their ribs
which_they do_not_have there_and clearly mistook the indian_village for_the horny toad which_is next door
but
if_you_want good tacos
good people_and a_good environment
check_this_place out
the_owner_is particularly hysterical
i_love_this_place
who eats a_hot dog in fry_bread
you_will if_you_go to indian_village
great tacos
fry_bread and burritos
stop at_the circle k next door_and get_a sixy of_your favorites to_enjoy with the_best mexican_food in cave creek
it's cool because_it's a_big time dive
the_food_is ok
the shells are deep_fried
but_the guts are_very boring
overall it's ok and_the_prices_are ok
it's worth_going once
twice max
hoping_for a unique arizona experience
we_stopped_in to indian_village
carefree for_lunch
at for tacos for_three people
it_wasn't at_all the
little local joint
atmosphere we_were expecting
staff_was straight faced
minus any warm_and fuzzy
food
albeit just standard fare
came out_quickly
seven tables inside the_dining_area needed attention and_there_was no temperature control
it_was freezing cold inside
there_was_an outdoor patio with additional tables but_we probably won't go_back_to see if_it_was any cleaner
such a_good_place
my_parents know the_owner bart personally and_he is_always really_friendly talkative and_always has a_smile on_his face
kind of hidden from more_of the_desert ridge area_and kierland but it_definitely is worth_the_drive if_you_live far
fry_bread
tacos
and burritos are definitely_the_best here
super cheap which_is better
employees are_always working hard and smiling so thats a_plus
food comes_out very fast_and theres seating out_and inside
there_is_a bathroom which doesnt look_like there_is one but_there_is and thats a_good_thing for_a carefree restaurant
meh
chimichanga seemed_like it_was_a pre made
kinda boring
i_had something a_bit_more authentic
decent
bit nothing_special
the chips are_just like mission out_of_a bag from costco
like another reviewer mentioned
there_are way_too many_other places_in cave creek to_try
you_can grab some_of this awesome mexican_food and_walk across the_parking_lot and_have_a beer at_the hideaway bar everyone_is cool
you_will_be put_off by_the look of_the indian_village but_it_is great
if_you_go to_the hideaway they_have menus and_will be_happy_to call your_order
it's_a win win
give_it_a try
we_were wanting a_small dive with authentic
good mexican_food
and_that's exactly what_we_got
food tasted_great
chicken tacos were_good_and my_husband loved_the tamales
the fry_bread with honey and sugar was so_yummy
if you're wanting a_small mom_and_pop joint
this_is your place
i_thought by going_to the indian_village i_would get_some great_food
i_have gotten their fry_bread before and_it_was_pretty tasty so i_thought_i would try something else
i_went_there with my_friend
i_got chicken tacos and frybread with powdered sugar and honey and he_got a_vegetable
egg and_cheese breakfast burrito
when_we_got the_food it_looked really appetizing
when we_started to_eat it_was_a different story
the_food_was_very bland
very_bland
the_chicken tacos had_no seasoning or_anything
the_plate came with_a_side_of salsa so i_tried_to use that_to kick off the_flavor
didn't work
with_no tabasco or any_other hot_sauce i_decided_to just tough it_out and finish my_plate
my_friends breakfast burrito was_not impressive either
he_had the_same complaint of blandness
the fry_bread was the_only_thing_that was_good
it_was_very inexpensive so_i'm_not too upset
both_of our_meals plus fry_bread and drinks_were
but as_a college student i_would_have_liked to_save the_money or cooked something at_home
i_told my_parents about the_experience and_they said_it_was hit_or_miss
so_if you_feel_like taking a_food gamble go_to_the indian_village
also the_service_was at par
nothing great but_nothing awful
spinach enchilada was_outstanding
tacos crisp
perfect
quesadilla with shredded chicken
cheese vanished from our_plates
rice_and beans perfect sides
we_thought we_ordered to much
nothing_was left
this_was authentic_and well prepared
five thumbs_up
this_place_is worth stars at_most
bland no_flavor fry_bread tacos
the fry_bread was_too doughy and soft_and thick for_me
i_like my fry_bread more airy and a_little_more crispy
the beans were dry_and the_cheese wasn't even melted
the_staff_was_very nice
the_atmosphere_is very cool
bikers everywhere
it's next_door_to a biker bar
i_love that_it's a_hole in_the_wall kind of_place which usually has the_best_food
i'd probably try_it_again after a_few drinks next door
food always taste better then
maybe that's why all_the high reviews
every year we_visit phx and head up_to cave creek to_visit bart and_eat some fry_bread
always delicious
always character
always an experience
love_this little_place
the_food_here_is simply amazing
when_i_walked in
i_did_not know what_to_expect
but
my_friend assured me_that this_place_was the_real deal
i_had_the spinach enchiladas and_they_were made_with perfection
this_place_is exactly how_i like_my mexican_food
we_sat outside on some benches which_had a_real cool southwestern feel
which_was wonderful since i_am_not from_the area
can't_wait_to try_this_place again
vegas is_the land of_the strip_mall
seriously
outside_of downtown
they're everywhere
and wedged in between all_the nail salons and paycheck advance stores
you_can find_some pretty_good restaurants
if_you_don't mind the_less than breathtaking surroundings
gandhi is a_solid
reliable indian_restaurant_that we've been_going_to for_years
the_building is mysteriously huge
with super high ceilings and_a dining_area that goes on for miles
but it_does fill up_at peak times on_the_weekends
the_decor_is nothing fancy bare white walls livened up_with_some wall hangings or framed pictures but you're_not there_for_the ambience
you're there_for tons_of spicy_food
when you_sit down
they'll plop some pappadom down in_front_of you
those crunchy cracker like flatbreads
plus a_mint cilantro sauce_and a_sweet and_sour sauce
i_love_this stuff
but be judicious in_your use_of the spicy_sauce
because water service_can_be a_bit_slow here
everything here_is good
especially the_garlic_naan
the_tandoori_chicken is yummy
as_is_the rogan_josh
palak_paneer
and_tikka_masala
entrees range from
although they_also have special tasting menus
including salad
rice
and_dessert
that range from
they_have_a lunch_buffet_on weekdays that's also an_excellent value
and_there's a_pretty_good selection_of beer_and_wine
including a_few indian_beers
to_go_with your_meal
nothing fancy decor or ambience wise
gandhi nevertheless delivers good and_reasonably_priced indian_food_in a_quiet and_pleasant setting
if vegas isn't already hot enough_for you
spice it up_with_a trip_to gandhi
and_get the_garlic_naan
desperate for some_indian_food
we_were referred to gandhi's india's_cuisine
we_arrived_at
pm
only_to discover they_don't open for_dinner on_a_saturday until_pm
as_we debated whether it_was_worth waiting_for
a_couple_of guys pulled up next_to us_and raved_about place
saying
it's really_good
it's hella good
so
hearing this
we_had_to come_back at_pm_and so we_did
what_a mistake
as_we piled in_at
pm
we looked around at the_customers already seated
lots_of indians were already dining and we_took this as a_good_sign
and_then we_saw the_buffet table set_up
hmmm
we_were hoping_for an a_la_carte_menu
unfortunately
they_only_had the_buffet option available and so_we_were stuck with_that
we_ordered mango_lassi to_drink and that_was_a highlight
then we_all loaded up_for_the buffet_line
gandhi's offers a_mix_of north and_south_indian cuisines and_i_was disappointed_with pretty much everything available
i_usually want indian_food when_i desire lots_of rich spices_and tastes going_on
and_all th dishes simmering away lacked any full or individual flavors
there_was no_spice
no heat
nothing that stood out
blah
they_offered mint cilantro sauce
but_no pappadoms
argh
i_love pappadoms and they_didn't_have any
i_was already disappointed
i_love naan_bread in_general
but usually try the_garlic or onion kinds
or whatever else_is offered
not at_this_place
they_just had plain_naan bread_that lacked any real flavor
everything had potatoes_in it
too_much potatoes if any
one_of_my dining companions felt that_she didn't_eat her money's worth and went_back_for dessert the_mango condensed milk dessert with fruit cocktail
we_all agreed that_was the_only_thing worth eating_there
how sad is_that
sure
i_ate
i_was hungry
it_wasn't particularly good_indian_food
it_was_just that
food
and_nothing else
this_restaurant was noted as award winning and
best ethnic restaurant_in_las_vegas
at_one point
i_would assume they_were a pretty_decent indian_restaurant some_time ago
but no_longer
i_guess it's a_sign when an_indian_restaurant starts out with_an a_la_carte_menu
then ditches it completely to_go for_the_buffet thing
it means hard times
they_are strapped and desperate for business
too_bad i_won't_be that desperate enough to_come_here again unless i'm dragged
yeah
for_the_price of less than pp
you_get more bang for_your buck this_way
but that's_not why i_came_to gandhi's to_eat
i_can't_believe this_place_had a banner outside calling it_the
best ethnic restaurant of_las_vegas
i_don't_remember what year or what company judged this_place
obviously the judges might_have ate_at this establishment years_ago
or_the judges had_been starving
for_days
so_that anything tastes delicious
prior_to eating_here
my_party was suggested by other frequent patrons that this_place_was
hella good
i_was_very disappointed because as i_walked_in i_noticed the_buffet_line
we_were_told that a_la_carte items_were not offered
so_that means the_buffet food_has_been sitting_out or possibly left_overs from yesterday
the_tandoori_chicken_was so dry_and unflavorful
the_lamb_was full_of_flavor from_all the_spices but_was just_too tough
a_lot_of_the vegatable dishes had_more cauliflower than expected
filler
so a_lot_of farting
ooh
and_that shredded carrot dessert
yech
the_only yummy thing_was the tangy mango_lassi
im not_sure if one_of_the_dishes i_had_was palak_paneer
if_it_was
it didnt taste_like what ive had_before
the_decor of_this_place was_so dated
it_was white walled with_a high ceiling with a_huge rug above you
it was_also_very chilly inside
the_buffet_line took away the appeal and_decor of_the_place
im assuming they went buffet_style b c of the_lack_of business
it_is_a hard find with morton's and buca di beppo right smack in_front_of you
i really_do love_indian_food can somebody please help out_here
is_there a_fantastic indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
hmmm
i_can't_believe that_other yelpers didn't_like gandhi
as_i_have had_only excellent dining experiences there
i've never tried_the_buffet
and_have been_wanting_to
but maybe_i won't now after what you_guys said about_it
i'm also vegetarian
so_if their meat_is horrible
i have_no_idea about_that
i_have_had the narvatan korma twice
excellent
and the_aloo palak
yum
you_can tell it's full_of butter
but who cares it's so_good
the_first times i_was_there they_brought pappadoms as_an_appetizer
i_was_a_little disappointed when they_didn't on my_last_visit
not_usually crowded unless you're there_at peak dinner_time on_weekends
the_room is_kind_of cavernous
i_wouldn't want_to sit right in_the_middle surrounded by tables of_people
try to_get one_of_the super comfy booths around the_outside
waiters_are nice_and super cute
kinda marginal indian_food why go_here when you_go down paradise to origin india which_is_great
i_went_here a_bunch_of times before_i found_out about origin for_the_lunch_buffet_and once for_dinner
it's_just basically a standard indian_place
but certainly nothing_to_write_home about
not_bad
just_not good
i'd keep looking
i_wasn't looking for_indian_food
i_was_looking_for cvs
so_i_could get_some excedrin for_my headache
but_i turned into the_wrong stripmall
and passed gandhi
no
not_that gandhi
he's dead
gandhi the_restaurant
what caught my attention were the_people
dozens of indian_people headed into the_restaurant
hmm
best of_las_vegas
proclaimed the banner
in_this_place
what_the heck
my_last vegas review was fatburger
let's diversify a_bit
the_restaurant_itself_is well appointed
clean
comfy
check
lots_of people on_the_buffet_line
is_there a_buffet tonight
no
they_said
that's just_for_the private party
which turned_out to_be_a busload of indian_people
no matter
i_looked at_the_menu
and_ordered one_of_their combo dishes
along with_a_large flying horse
within minutes
complimentary papadum arrived
along_with a tamarind_sauce and_a cilantro sauce
to_my_surprise
the papadum were awesome
hot
crisp
tasty
the_sauces_were excellent as_well
the_combo arrived and_the_food continued to impress
i_haven't_had indian_food_this tasty_and authentic since_i_was back_in ny
one_thing_i disliked was the_dish a metal plate with compartments which reminded me of_a tv dinner
i_would_have preferred to_see several small plates
but_i_guess that_would_be more work
the_combo included a_choice_of dessert
and_i passed up my_usual kheer in favor of_a pistachio kulfi ice_cream recommended_by my_server
it_was_amazing
except_for_the spoon
see below
reading the_other_reviews
either they_have improved dramatically
or perhaps i_was the beneficiary of stumbling on this_place_on a_night where_they knew they_had to have_their a game on
or risk upsetting said busload of_people
i_would award stars
except that_my napkin was slightly dirty
and_the spoon accompanying my dessert_was clearly dirty as_well
as in_the dishwasher didn't do a_good job
i_left stuffed_and content
aka
feeling very un gandhi like
this_place isn't as_good as orgin india
just down_the_street
or india_palace
also just down_the_street
but_you_can do a_lot worse
we_have dined here_a_few_times
with_our year old
and_we_had a_great_time
the_food_is_good not stellar but_good
it_has what_i consider to_be_a run of_the mill americanized northern_indian menu
typical selection_of_indian beers
staff_was_very_friendly
food_was_great quality
everything_we have_ordered has_been good
the_buffet_is ok here
i_actually enjoyed dinner much_more
i_got one_of_the tandoori sets which was_pretty_good
i'd rather_go to_other places_for an_indian_lunch_buffet
but the_atmosphere_is kinda
eh
here compared_to some_of_the_other places around which_is why this wouldn't_be my_first choice
average_food
good
traditional and ethnic atmosphere
buffet_items are often cold_and limited
service_is rude
unless_you are an ethnic indian
they often take_your food away while_you are_still eating and do_not like_to answer questions
i_prefer tamba restaurant myself
which_i hear is managed by same individuals
however
they_just started managing this_place
so_maybe there_are good_things to_come
we shall see
i've_never_had such a_bad_experience with_indian_food
the_food_was serve on_a metal tray like_the one_in prisons
its terrible and_it_is rediculousy expensive_for the qaulity and portion
unbelievable
spend your money elsewhere
again
uninspired indian in_vegas
the_service_was poor during_the sunday dinner rush
and_the_naan i_ordered was burnt to_the_point that it_was_almost inedible
the greasy pakora_and dry curry were_not helped by_my continuously empty water_glass
pass
everything about_this_place was_just so_so including the_service
nothing_was really_bad but_nothing stands out
had decent lamb_vindaloo
asked_for extra spicy_but_not so_spicy
chickent tikka_masala
malai_kofta_and a_couple_different naans which weren't that_great
still looking_for_a_good cheap eats indian in_vegas
this_place_is a_little_pricey though not_as ridiculously overpriced as gaylords
if_your craving decent_indian_food and_not afraid_to spend a_couple bucks then this_place should fit the_bill
i_ate_here a_long_time ago when it_was_just a_vegetarian place
but_now i_think_they got new_management
new interior design
and most_importantly new chefs
i_went_for lunch_buffet_and dinner
the_buffet_was excellent
well flavored
the_only flaw is_you have_to_go up_to_the buffet to_get naan
so everyone_was just waiting until they_make some
then everyone rushes to_it
really_good food
reasonably_priced
but_it's_not as_good_as_it gets
stars
i_went_here with_a_friend from vegas on_his reccomendation and at_first was_a_little put_off by the_outside of_the_place as_it didn't_look so_nice
but looks can_be deceiving
the_inside of ghandi's is_very_nice
their service_was_prompt and_their food_was_pretty_good
not_the_best_indian i_have_ever_had but_definitely solid food
next_time i'm back in_vegas i_would try soemthing different but_i_would not_be afraid_to return here
located_in_a weird angled funky strip i_came_here to_satisfy my_indian_food binge
this_restaurant_is large_and looks as_if it hosts banquets and members of_the community
i_have_only had_indian at_one other restaurant
gandhi does offer a_wide_variety_of dishes
there_are over vegetarian_entrees
there_are_some nans and baked breads i_have_never seen before_and i_love_the breads
my_friend_had tandoori prawns which even_in san_francisco i_don't_see at_all
there_are a_few_dishes i_will order next_time just_for_the sheer fact i_can't find these_dishes at_home
whoever gave this_place more then one_star has_never eaten_indian_food before
the_food_was_very bland
and expensive
for
including soft_drinks for_a_lunch_buffet
besides being very_bland there_was_a serious issue of_meat
there_was almost none
just a_little_bit_of chicken_in their_dishes
and the_tandoori_chicken left a_lot to_be disired
thats it
no beef somosas or lamb or goat
this_was_my second time_here
the_first was yrs ago
sadly the_place hasn't improved
food
service
had_the gandhi thali a sampler of_vegetarian items
the_malai_kofta was_tasty
but_the mattar_paneer was blah and_had only_one small chunk of cheese
the_samosa had_a tender crust
for_dinner
it_would_be better to_go with_a_group so_you_can choose the_things to_share
service_was_ok but unexceptional
i'd_like_to go_back_for lunch to_try_their buffet
having just_got off_the plane from la and_having not eaten for several hours
i was_on_the verge of passing out
not_really
but_i_was feeling pretty peckish
jeff and_i_were driving towards_the hotel
when_i spotted gandhi out_of_the corner_of my eye
knowing that_he likes india
having lived there_for over_a_year
i_thought he might like to_try
i_am always willing to try_a_new indian_place
i_got_a combination plate that had_chicken_tikka
some marinated chicken
kafta chopped up and_a grilled shrimp
the_plate also came_with some lentils
rice
raita
lettuce
paneer in_a curry_sauce and_a curry_with shrimp in_it
jeff got a_vegetarian plate that_had the_same rice
raita and_lentils
but_he also_got a cauliflower dish
i_don't_remember the_name
and some_other curried vegetable
he ate it_all
so_i_know he liked_it
but_i_don't_think he_loved it
i_loved pretty much everything_i got
except the_lentils
they needed something
salt
the_paneer_was delicious
it reminded me_of_the fresh cheese my grandmother used_to make
the shrimp_curry was_delicious
just_the_right_amount_of heat to_it
the_raita was_tasty
the_rice_was nothing_special
i_liked_the naan
i_ate several pieces and_i_don't normally do_that
jeff ordered a_mango_lassi
he_asked that_they make_it special with_no milk
just yogurt
they_did that and_he loved_it
he might_have ordered another
if_he weren't so full
the_service started_off really_well
but_then it went downhill from there
we_got_the food and_then we_never saw the_waiters again
they_were_busy serving others
so
we_waited forever for the_bill and_a box to_take_home the_leftovers
the_decor_was kinda nice
kinda funky
kinda dark and kinda fashionable
i_liked certain parts of_the_restaurant
like_the giant wooden ganesh near_the entrance
the_red on the_walls was_nice
the paintings weren't anything special
they turned up_the lights for_us
so_we_could read the_menu
there_were_some special rooms that could_be shut off_with curtains
i_liked that touch
i_would_definitely_go back
i_wonder what the_buffet would_have_been like
since_we_were there_for_dinner
the_food_was superb
the_service
well
it_was clear our_party was_a burden to the_server
we_weren't told_that we'd be charged extra_for things_like rice_and bread
even_though_the server kept bringing us more
i'm not_sure how_much each side_of_rice was
but_it_was really expensive and they_didn't bring_us a complimentary portion for_our_entrees
the_portions_were tiny
think happy meal tiny
this wouldn't_be a_problem if the_prices weren't so high
all in_all
i_won't_be back
but_i'll be looking_for another_restaurant that_has good_food
good portions
good_prices
and_good_service
stars just for_the_food
i've been a_fan_of this_place_for several years
my trips to_las_vegas are_not complete until i've visited the_buffet
the_quality has_been the_same all_the_time
the_taste has_always been_great
and the_people there are_very_friendly
i_don't frequent an_indian_restaurant_in los angeles as_much_as_i have in_las_vegas
looking_forward_to more_food next_time_i go
alright
this_is another place_that you_have_to know_how_to do right
i_have_been_here for lunch_and_dinner
and lunch_is totally the_way_to_go
they_have_a really_tasty indian_buffet with_lots_of options
i_am_not_sure which ones are gluten_free
so the_next_time_i go_back_to vegas
i'll_have more_to report
the_service_is alright
i_usually_go thirsty for_water
remember
your lassi is_not included in_the_buffet price
they_do_have large bus tours of_people who come_here en masse
so rub your rabbit's foot to_make_sure you_don't show up_at the_same_time
dinner_is table_service
which_isn't the_most awesome
and provides less value than the_buffet
great_vegetarian selections
again
will update this again with gf facts
the_best value_for indian_food_in_vegas
gandhi features a_very solid indian_lunch_buffet that_can sometimes miss_the mark slightly depending on_the particular variety they_put out_for the_day and_how well it matches your personal preferences
the_location isn't_the greatest
inside a_rather nasty east flamingo strip_mall next_to a cigar shop
but they_do_a good job of making you forget this once you_enter the establishment
a_hole in_the_wall place
indian owned
i_like how when_you_walk in you_feel_like you_are_in a_real indian_restaurant
complete with_a hindu elephant god statue there
there_were lots_of indian customers eating_there
food is_ok
bucks lunch_buffet
def get_the off coupon from hotel magazines
i_don't_really know my_indian_food
so hard_to judge it's authenticity
not the_best_i've_had
but def edible
naan_bread
salad
tandori_chicken
sauces_were good
skip on the_curry
lunch_buffet_was very crowded on the_weekend long line
but water drink service_was still_good
a_wide_variety_of food nan_was actually out_in the_buffet_line which_was_nice to_see done
only_thing was the_plastic utensils bothered me
i_could live with the_plastic water cups but plastic forks and spoons seem like picnic items_and eating tandori_chicken with_them proves difficult
i_was glad to_see_a well_stocked buffet even_with such_a crowd
good_food but not_the_best to_bring me back often mango_lassi_was okay too
after a_week of all_you_can_eat in_vegas
what_do you_do next
have ayce indian_food of_course
back_in college
my buddies and_i_would always swing by gandhi india cuisine at_the_end_of each visit_to vegas
nothing cures a hang over like nice buttery
saucy
and oiling indian_food
it_really isn't_that disgusting when eating_it
brian from family guy describes indian_food_as
brian is_so hungry he eats stewie's diaper
hey
at least its better_than indian_food
that's exactly how_i feel
indian_food quality_is always hit_or_miss
if you_cannot stomach
ethnic
foods
i_don't recommend trying_indian_food
but if_you_have_a taste for adventure and_have_a strong stomach then try_it
i_love garlic_naan_and curry_chicken
there_are a_lot_of other_items and_sauces that i'm_not sure_what they_are
but_they taste delicious
be_warned you_will_have a food_coma after your gandhi experience
the_restaurant_is family_owned and servers make_you feel at_home
i_went a_few_times with_indian friends to_help explain what everything_is to_me
this_place is_hard_to find
it_is near terrible casino and behind a morton's steakhouse restaurant i_think
near a massage parlor just off_the_strip
i_think the_way_i first discovered_this_place was through a_coupon in_a las_vegas magazine
my_friends were semi serious about going
it_was_a_very hot day_and our car broke down right in_the_same plaza
call it fate or luck
i_don't believe in luck
in_vegas
its all skill
i've been told this is_some_of_the_best indian_food_in_town
oh boy am_i in trouble
i_miss good_indian_food
my trip_to_vegas is_not complete without_the fountains at_the bellagio
the lions at mgm and a_few_other places_that i_can't mention here
but last but_not_the least is gandhi india cuisine's exquisite lunch_buffet
i've_been_to vegas
for various reasons
times_and had lunch at_this_restaurant
don't_get_me_wrong
i_am sure there_are people who prefer_the wide spread buffets at_the casinos
but_this_one is_no less
the_food_is well_cooked and_the arrangement is_nice
the_price_is
if_i still remember
all_you_can_eat
isn't_that sweet
its about a_mile or_so from_the_strip in_a_strip_mall
enjoy
there_is a_lot_of indian_cuisine competition but_this_place does have great_service_and great comfort food_at_a good_price
i_really_enjoy the_neighborhood competition
mint_indian_bistro and origin of_india more though
but_there_is something about_this_place that continues to_keep itself standing
despite this
i_would_definitely_go here if_i_had more friends_who like_indian_food or ate out as_much_as_i used_to
this_place_is_a lot older
but_i live right_up the_street_from this_place_and if_i got tired of frequenting mint_indian_bistro on flamingo
i_would_go here to_get_a change of setting
i_think_it is_a_little more_authentic than the_mint
but_i_am not_a_fan_of authentic
i_like a_little_bit_of flare to my_food that_is catered to americans
my_friend likes this_place more_than mint
so_maybe they_have_some special dishes_that stand_out for_vegetarians
again
because_it sits in_a terrible neighborhood
the_fact_that it_still survived the_many years of recession probably says a_lot about_the authenticity of their_dishes
i_don't_know a_lot about_their off the_buffet menu entrees but_i hear they_are pretty_good
the_decor has antique wood and_has_a fine_dining appeal with the_table cloth and_nice water_glass
but
this seems to_be_a common theme for all_of_the indian_restaurants
they_are_very properly set
the_indian_food buffet_is_a good_deal
but if_i_had patience i_would order_off_the_menu because they_will cook_it to_order and_the_food will taste fresh_and more flavorful
the_restaurant_is very simple_and plain on_the_outside
once you_enter
the_decor_is simple
yet nice
the_atmosphere and music is upbeat
service_was_good_and the_food_here_is good
but_nothing compared_to baluchi's in new york
i_was_there with_a_group and we_ordered mango_lassi
a_variety_of naan
chicken_vindaloo
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_biryani
and_more
the_place_is worth_a try if_you_are out in_vegas_and are willing to explore outside of_the_strip
good atmosphere
once you_get inside
knowledgeable helpful staff
lamb_was tough
but vegetarian picks were_good
solid value in_the all_you_can_eat lunch_buffet
carb overload usually sets in_minutes later but worth_it
the_service_is okay the_decor works
they_could turn down the_music a_little
it_felt a_little cluby during_the day
they_have_a chutney with olives that_i put_on most everything
it's spicy_and bitter at the_same_time but i_like_it
all_of_the dishes_are prepared_with quality in_mind
this yelper likes the_lunch
i_am indian so not_to_mention i know_how_to make indian_food
during recent trip_to_vegas
i_had lunch_buffet_for
at_this_restaurant
food_was_so terrible in_terms of_spices that_it broke all_the records of high spices i_had ever_tasted in_my_life
if_this_is the_quality_of_food served_at gandhi restaurant_and people_are revisiting this_place that means either they_have no clue of_indian recipe or they_really love very high spices
i_went_to gandhi's while in_vegas with a_friend_of_mine from high school back_in july
if_you_don't know_where this_place_is
chances are_you probably won't find_it as_it_is hidden within a_strip_mall and you_would think_it_was closed down if you didn't know any better
we_were_seated_immediately as_it appeared that my_friend knew everyone in_the_place
everyone made_sure to_come over_and say hello and_to constantly check on_us all evening
i_actually felt like_a celebrity with_all_the attention we_were getting
anyway enough about_that
onto_the food
we_ordered_the paneer_pakora which_was homemade deep_fried cottage_cheese
gosht vindaloo
and_the_chicken makhanwala along_with tons_of nan
i_was_in indian_food heaven
the_lamb was_cooked_to_perfection and_the_chicken had_a_nice blend_of_spices and the_sauce_was divine
i_am sitting here licking my lips still remembering just how_good it_was
this_place_is a_nice_little hidden_gem that you_should really try if_you_are ever in_vegas
you_do realize that_it means you_will_have to explore outside of_the_strip so venture if you dare
amazing_food and beautiful decor
really_enjoyed my_visit and will_definitely go_again
this_review_is_for_the lunch_buffet only
i've never been dissappointed
well
that's_not true
i'm on_the verge of tears when_they run out_of naan
which_is_a frequent occurrence for_the_lunch_buffet
but
it's one_of_my favored lunchtime stops
plenty of vegeterian options
and_they_have enough variety that_it's rarely same combination_of dishes
they_really won me over with_their okra dish
magnificient
muah
that's_what sticks out_in my_head the_most
so_i_guess the_rest is good_but_not necessarily spectactular
it_is_in a somewhat seedy strip_mall
but heck
some_of vegas' greats share that characteristic
lotus of siam anyone
interior decor i_find quite pleasing
the_lunch_buffet will run you around
so middle_of_the road pricewise
too
i_think_this belong on_your list if you're racking up_your checklist of vegas' indian_buffets
i_want_to give minimum possible star
horrible food
worst customer_service
while_eating the dinner_buffet
i_have_been asked twice
i_mean guy couldn't see me eating the_food
tiniest bowl i_have_ever seen at_this_place
you_can't even take_out the_curry with_a spoon out_of that bowls
please don't waste_your money at_this_place
avg and expensive food
we_went_for_dinner
aloo tiki was pieces_of fried dough
green chutney felt like spolied cilantro smoothie
dal_makhani there_was nothing makhani about_it just dome boiled lentils
the_nan with_nuts was_so sweet_and had_only coconut and_no nuts
if u tell them what_the problem in_food they_just completely ignore u rather than fix it
so don't_go by menu descriptions they_just do whatever is convenient to_them and use left_overs
a_big avoid
guys please avoid_this place_at least for_buffet
i'm_not allowed to_give no rating else would have_done that
we_just came_back from vegas_i couldn't_stop myself from writing review for_this_place
being an_indian knows how indian_food taste
smell
looks like
believe_me it_was nothing_like that
the_menu_was ok nothing fancy for_the_price you_pay
here_is list_of items_in vegetarian sect
yellow daal
rajma
any damn indian can_make that better_than what they_had
shahi panner
tasted just_like heinz ketchup
aloo baigan
big chunk of uncook potatoes
naan
it took_forever_to get them
we told_them times that_there_is no naan how are we supposed_to eat all above items
rice
we didnt cared about_that as we_left within mins of_our so called lunch bufftet
onion pakora
cold pakora
have you ever ate one
idli
hard as stone
they made_it days_ago to_serve it
sambhar
sambhar was_way tooo spicy trust_me when an_indian says too_spicy it_is
the_service_is really_really really_bad
they dont care that you_want something or_not
they_were behaving as if_they_are doing big favor on_us by attending us
ohhh guys cmon
its one_of_the buffet you never want_to waste_your money
believe_me
the scenery is pretty_nice here
from the_outside
you_can't see much_and the_place_looks secluded
but_once you're inside
the_place_is actually pretty nicely_decorated inside
food_here_was decent
i_still feel like india_palace had better_food just_because the_food_was hotter
then_again
that might just depends on when_they run out of_food_and have to_put new ones in
i_would_say ghandhi has more selection on food
it_was_just a_little disappointing since they_didn't_have that popular chicken_dish i_like
service_was fine
ohhh myyy agahhh
ghandi has this lunch_buffet_that you_cannot beat
sometimes i daydream about_the_food the_next_day
that's_not normal for_me
sometimes i_will think about who would_be willing to_go_with me_for sunday lunch
i_can assure you that_every single person i_have_ever introduced to_indian_food by taking them here has begged me to_go_back immediately
if you've never_had_indian_food
its the_perfect place to_start because you_can pick and choose
it's addicting and_you can't_really beat the_price for_a_buffet of about per_person
the_food_is_so flavorfuls and_there_is always a_ton_of variety to_choose_from
the_outside is_nothing to_write_home_about
located_in_a sketchy parking_lot area but inside its like_a beautiful indian palace of deliciousness
the_service_is nice
like_the cashier makes jokes sometimes that i_don't immediately understand
but_then eventually i_do
my boss wanted_to_go here
so we_had_to
the_decor_is a_bit dark but nice and_clean
i_thought_it_was a_bit_pricey for_the limited selection
food_is flavorful though
already been_back a_few_times
wow
such_an upgrade since i_used_to spend countless lunch_buffets with coworkers
back_in the_day when i_used_to work in_the howard hughs pkway offices
i_took_my wife there_for_lunch just last_week
the grub
chutneys and_sauces galore
plenty of_your veggie favorites
stewed chick_peas
saag_paneer
spinach with cheese
curry potatoes_and peas
fried onion dumplings
and other_dishes all_delicious
meat too tandori grilled chicken
chicken_tikka
butter_chicken
etc
got bread_and carbs
basatmi rice
naan
rice cakes
spicy noodle dish
samosas
all_good
dessert
mango_custard with fruit
fried brown sugar pastries in_a sugary syrup sauce
and_fresh fruit yummy
hot tea
coffee
mango_lassi
sodas and juices available
the joint
such_a turn around from when i_used_to frequent years back
the_white table clothes have_been replaced by all wood tables covered by fancy black linens
the open balcony now houses private dining areas perfect_for parties that want an intimate booth
even the_buffet section is granite counter tops with built in buffets fancy
much fancier than the_old tables with_the_buffet heat trays
indian decor many intricate paintings and woodwork abound
including a_huge wooden hand carved goddess at_the entry
floor to ceiling curtains and fabrics of_india surround you
very_nice
plenty of seating
clean_and upscale
especially for_a_buffet
the squeeze
friendly_and_attentive service as_always
about per_person for_lunch a_little_pricey
cash and card accepted
the_final say
my_wife_and_i enjoyed_our lunch_buffet
and_it kept us full for_most of_the_day
and for_me
it was_such_a pleasant surprise to_see_that the_owner has done so_much to upgrade on such_a_great indain buffet restaurant
i_go for_the_buffet
i have_no_idea what_i'm eating but it_tastes great
the service_is_excellent
yummy
we had_dinner_here and it_was_the_best indian_food_i_have_ever_had
can't to_try_their lunch_buffet the_next_time we_are_in vegas
everything_is ala_carte so_it can_get pricey_but well_worth_it
great_food
avg
price
spicy_enough to stimulate your taste_buds
good_service
great tomato_soup
bhindi_masala
chana_masala
naan
jeera rice
dal
great interior
location_and view from outside dose not reflect that_this_is located in_las_vegas
dull and dark from outside
definitely_will go_again
woman cannot live from liquor alone so at_some_point i_had_to eat
being_a pissed off hungry vegetarian in_a city catered to meat_eaters
i began_to feel aggressive
then_i drove down paradise road and_saw a_sign that read gandhi
i_remembered the_concept of ahimsa all_of a sudden
took_a deep breath
and figured that_the_food gods were on_my side
i_walked inside and_saw meat_on the_plates of_other patrons
i_was mildly annoyed since gandhi was_a vegetarian_and i_normally would_have_been a pain in_the ass about_it
but i_was_so desperate for_food that_i_was willing to sacrifice my principles for the_good of my_stomach
i_asked_the server if there_were_a_few vegetarian_dishes present at_the_buffet
and_he smiled and proceeded_to show me_the goods
after correctly guessing that i_am_from california
a_vegetarian twenty something with_a serious sense_of entitlement
where else could i be from
i proceeded_to eat_this excellent
varied
and overpriced lunch
surrounded by friendly_staff who_were attentive but_not overbearing
i_had such_a_great meal that i_made my_friends go_there with_me again the_next_day
i_highly_recommend_this_place to vegetarian tourists
don't_be deceived by the_outside
this restaurant_is_located at_the_end_of a_strip_mall
there's_a simple neon sign outside_and when_you_walk in it's_a_bit frightening for_a moment
then_you turn the_corner and_see a_beautiful restaurant not_what you'd_expect
the ceilings are high
the_tables have high backs so you_have a_little_more privacy
there_are rooms that_have curtains that_can_be drawn
and_it's dimly lit
the_food_is_very_good and_the_prices_are reasonable_and can't compare_to anything on_the_strip
this_is based on my_recent visit
end_of sept
food there_was delicious
specially butter_chicken_and paneer_masala
yum
me and_my_wife were amazed on how_good tasting both entrees_were
for_a_buffet
great food_and_great_service
i_have_only eaten the_lunch_buffet_which is_good
i_really_enjoy the_variety_of food_and_the must_have mango_lassi drinks
yummy
my_wife and_i_have_been coming_to this restaraunt since for_one very important reason
they treat us like family
we've experienced other_indian venues
but according_to my_taste_buds
nothing compares
the_food_is_great if_you_are into strong herbs and_spices
i_dont know what_is in_most dishes
but thats not important if_the grub is smack good
i_know one_of_my faves is chicken_masala
they_have_a selective buffet from pm pm for
which_is_a great option_for those who want_to dib and dab here_and there to_see_if this kind of cuisine_is your thing
the_interior_is exotic and the_music is_indian pop which all adds to_the dining_experience
when_you come_in
ask_for_a server named megiddo
i swear he_is ghandi reincarnated
my_wife_and_i have_tried only the_lunch_buffet
since they_do_not serve from_the_menu during_lunch
maybe i_have_been spoiled by_the excellent_indian_food in_and around san_francisco
i
e
pakwan
shalimar
and others
at_any rate the_food_at ghandi is mediocre and overpriced
for_the_lunch_buffet
loaded with bland vegetarian_dishes and_a_few chicken scrap entrees
oh
well
i_may try another indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
though_i may just wait until the_next_time i'm_in san_francisco
despite being located_in_a seedy strip_mall
a_friend_and i_had previously tried_this_place for_dinner
and_it_was decent
star territory
however a_recent visit to_try_their lunch_buffet_was a_different story
the_first_thing that stuck out was_the cheap plastic plates
disposable plastic eating utensils
and styrofoam plastic cups for_water and soups sauces
i_have_been_to many indian_lunch_buffets
but this_was_the_first time_i've seen such cheap dining ware being used
while they_had several vegetarian offerings
they_only_had a_couple_of mediocre meat_dishes
chicken_tikka_masala_and tandoori_chicken
there_was_a huge tray of naan_which looked overly doughy and dried out so_i didn't_even bother trying_it
the subpar mango pudding was_too watery_and contained cheap canned fruit
the halwa dessert was_extremely dry_and just gross
my_friend_and_i commented that the_only_thing at_the_buffet that_they seemed_to do pretty well was the_basmati_rice
when_the bill_came
i_was_in for_another shock
for an_indian_lunch_buffet
that_has got_to make_this the priciest one in_town since most are_in_the range_of
to
now if this_buffet was_one_of_the_best
i_probably wouldn't mind paying a premium price
come_to think_of it
if_they lowered the_price to
it_still wouldn't_be worth_it
there_are just too_many better places_in_town
i
e
taj_palace or mt_everest
to waste_your appetite on_this_one
came across this_place when_i visited las_vegas just before christmas and_wanted_to find a_place_to have indian_food
ordered_a_chicken biryani carryout order since dinner_buffet was_almost on_the verge of completion
let me explain here i_am_a food lover and_can instantly say by_the look of_indian_restaurants on what_kind_of food to_expect
there_are different versions of
authentic
indian cuisines floating around and_i_must_say this_is_not one_of_them
biryani_was sweet
authentic biryani_is never sweet
with cashew and raisins
good luck with_this_place
from_a shady looking
wrecked place from outside to_a exquisite ethnic indian loungish looking interiors this_restaurant really did surprise me
we infact planned to turn around go elsewhere looking_at it_from outside
and_we_are glad not_to have_done that
the_restaurant_has_a lotta potential to_be turned into an_indian nightclub lounge at_night
thanks_to their multiple rooms
multiple floors
red interior decor_and tall ceilings
we_took the_lunch_buffet_which i_felt was kinda ok
the_best_part_of all_was the_tandoori_chicken
delishhh
one of_the_best_i've tried
the_rest were passable
their mango_lassi_was pretty_good however
overall_i felt aint a_bad deal for_a_quick indian_lunch quite close_to_the strip in_a grand setting
the_food_was terrific
soooooo
good
i_could_eat their nan for_the_rest_of my_life
i_will_definitely_go back
the_parking however
is sketchy and i_was_quite concerned leaving my car outside
the_service_was probably the_worst i_have_ever_had
my_server never said a_single word to my_table the_entire time_we_were_there
we_were never asked_if_we wanted anything to_drink or_anything
very_very strange
i_do_not think_the parking_is sketchy
it_is vegas folks
it_is_a city
get over_it
decor music was_rather odd
i_liked_it personally
but_was far_from what_i_would consider
indian
buffet food_was_ok
but rather bland
all_of_the dishes tasted as_if they_had used the_exact same recipe
the_spice_level was non existent which_is_a deal breaker for_me_and indian_food
although the_outside is_not spectacular
i_was_impressed with_their set_up and buffet service
i_was feeling the_mood
the_music
the_food aroma
the curtains
etc
it_was_a_nice place_and our_waiter_was very_attentive_and funny
the_food_was_delicious and_i thoroughly_enjoyed every_dish
mango_lassi was_to_die_for
overall
lunch_buffet price_is within inexpensive affordable
i_will_be sure to_make_a trip here whenever i_go_to vegas
went_for buffet_lunch
the_food_is ok_and reasonable
the_variety is_good
maybe a_dish or_two more_for the vegetarians needed
decor is_ok
adult price_is
and kids is
great_for out_of towners who crave indian_food
this_was_the_best indian_restaurant my_parents liked
they r vegeterrian and_were happy_to_see lot_of veggi options
their_food_is like home and_desserts
sevayian kheer
was_awesome
i_absolutely recommend brunch buffet
good north_indian lunch and_south_indian breakfast
overall a_good_place_to have_a brunch
for gandhi
i_had_to make myself stop_eating because_i_was so full
but_it_was sooooo good
in_las_vegas_for business
four_of us went_here_for dinner after_a_long day
i_really wasn't in_the_mood for_indian_food
but_i_was too tired to_try to_talk the_other into going somewhere_else
i'm so_glad i_didn't protest
the_restaurant looks_like_a nothing hole in_the_wall in_a_strip center
but it's_very nicely_decorated on_the_inside
a young ish sihk guy
who may_have been an owner or manager
just_got that impression
greeted us and_took our_orders
he_has super_nice
and i_got_a kick out_of how
when_my boss was being_a heinous jerk for no reason per usual
the_guy would just look_at me_and laugh
awesome
the_buffet looked amazing so i_opted_for that
i_was planning on waiting until everyone else got their_food to dig into the_buffet
but_as everyone else_was ordering
our_server tapped me on_the shoulder and whispered
go get_your food now
trust_me
just_go
i_was totally confused
but_he seemed very_polite_and earnest about_it
so_i did
not two minutes later
an entire busload of indians on_a site seeing tour came pouring in_and lined up at_the_buffet
so_glad he_told me to_go
almost the_entire buffet_was vegetarian
score
and_it_was all_good
the mattar_paneer was_amazing
i_could_have sat there_and eaten that_all night until_i exploded
i've_never_had indian_food_that good before
i_will_be_back next_time i'm_in_vegas
if i_have_to leave my_curry fury boyfriend at the_hotel and_eat that mattar_paneer by myself
i_will have_it again
thanks_for the_great
friendly_service and_the beyond delicious_food
best food_i've_had_in vegas so_far
my_boyfriend_and_i loved everything_we_had
i'm a_vegetarian he's not
our service_was_a_bit spotty
we_had_to_wait a_good minutes_for_our bill
and_i never_got the_dessert that_came_with my_meal after_ordering it
i_would rate_this if our service had been_better
we beat_the dinner rush thankfully
when_we_walked_in there were_only ten other customers
when_we_walked out
that number had_at least tripled
the_ambiance was intimate and_the restroom was_one_of_the cleanest i've seen in_this city
my_family went_there and_had a_great_time
the_decor_is_very good looking
the_service_was slow they listen to everything you say
the_best_thing is_that_the waiters_are very_friendly_and are_very conversational
the food_was_ok the_lamb vindulu is_delicious_and the ice coffee was_awesome
i_would_recommend_this restaurant to_anyone
not_a_good service experience after the_third time
they_give preference to people who arrive after you_and i_would_not reccomend going_there
terrible experience from the_owner
i_have_to take back my four_stars review about_this fine indian_cuisine
that make_me every_time happier
we recently went_to_the buffet on_the labor day weekend and
it_was_amazing experience
the food_selection was_excellent_and we_had few items out_of_the regular_menu
still love the_service
also the_place
i_like gandhis
always_have
sure
the parking_is sketchy
and i_wouldn't live_in_the adjoining neighborhood if_they paid me
and_there's at least guy that lives
or least weekends
by_the dumpsters
but this_restaurant_is very_very_good with an_awesome buffet
beautiful decor_and quality service
and_that's all_i_can ask of_them to_be
looking_for_good indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas for_years
we_finally found
the_one
everything about
gandhi
is_good
maybe location is_a_little farther than i_would_like
decor
rich dark colors
very spacious rooms
food
excellent
papadom
compliments of the_chef
light crispy
not_overly spicy
for_starters we_ordered paneer_pakora
very_good seasoned excellent appetizer
mulligantawny soup
be_prepared_to unusual preparation
not_what you_would_expect
but very_good
entries
chicken_tikka_masala omg
best tikka_masala i_ever_had
fish korma
this_dish is_not on_a menu
but i_asked_if it_would_be possible to prepare it for_us
that's another big star to gandhi restaurant
every our request was accommodated
they try to_make your dinner a_real
experience
which gives a_great feeling of_being taken_care of
back_to entries eggplant bharta
we_asked to_make_it mild
well
you_can not_really make_this dish mild it_is meant to_be spicy
but_hey managed
funny
mild on_a beginning it gives you_a
kick
a_couple_of sends later
we_actually asked to_make another one like_it
so we_can take_it home
naan
excellent
another item we_ordered more for_take_out
we_enjoyed later
prices
surprisingly inexpensive
the_portions_are quite big
we_ordered mango_lassie
which_was twice the_size_of any lassie we_had before
price however was
i_almost was_ready to_say to our_waiter that_this_is to cheap
and they_should raise the_price
but
of_course i_did_not say anything
overall great_restaurant
if_you_get a_chance stop_here and_you won't regret_it
my fiance and_i_were on_a mini vaca for the_weekend
we_had just gotten out_of_a unlv game and had_no_idea where to_eat
we didn't_want_to go_back on_the busy strip and_came across gandhi
i_love_indian_food_and haven't seemed_to find any i_like since leaving sacramento for arizona
we_were_there_for holiday and_so the_restaurant_was strictly buffet
which the_owner said is_not usually the_case
the assortment_of foods was_the_best_i've seen on any buffet
plenty of options_for meat_eaters and vegetarians alike
everyone_was friendly
in_fact in_some cases they_were a_little_too on_top_of their game
perhaps checking_in on_us a_little_too much
we knew from the_moment we_walked_in a saw the_place packed that_we_were at_the right spot
i_will_be_back there and_only wished i_lived closer
lunch_buffet_is perfect
i_am all_about indian_buffets
the_price here_is good_too
went_here_for lunch_with co_workers and_had a_great_time
plenty to_choose_from
the_potatoes that_have spinach in_it is_amazing
the_naan_is nothing_to_write_home about
and some_other just_okay dishes
for_sure try the_butter_chicken
best_of all it's not_too heavy
i_was_on a vacation with_my girl friend was craving_for_indian_food
finally on_the busy strip
i_found gandhi
though i'm an_indian
its been long i had_indian_food
we_were_there_for the_buffet
the_place_was_packed
there_were lots variety_of foods and is_one_of_the_best buffets
plenty of options_for non vegetarians_and even for_vegetarians like_me
navratna korma was_awesome
crew was_friendly_and were prompt in serving
they made_us_feel like at_home which justifies the_crowd inside
it_is definitely a_good_indian_restaurant
this_place_has thali's with different names like bengali thali
south_indian thali etc
thali with names from every part_of india
but each thali has more or less the_same food punjabi food
like chicken_tikka nan_and dal
i_had ordered south_indian thali and_thought he_had got the_wrong order
when i_told_him about_it
he_told me i_should_have read the_menu more carefully
he_told me no matter_what the_name
it_only has punjabi food
i_felt cheated by them and_left
they_did charge me_about for_that fake thali
review_is_for_the lunch_buffet
not_the_best buffet in_vegas and_not_the cheapest
running about
but_you_can expect some_good spice from_the_buffet options
what sets gandhi india cuisine's buffet aside from other_indian_buffets in_vegas is_the surprising spice
the general tendency in an_indian_buffet is_to keep_it bland
the_buffet has to_make a_lot_of different palates happy and_the general tendency is_to keep_it bland to_make_the most folks happy
but cheers to gandhi for_not skimping on_the spice
they_usually have several vegetarian_options in_the_buffet and a_number_of delicious chicken_dishes
there's some real hit and miss going_on with_the dishes
i_loved_the paneer in spicy butter cream and_the_chicken_tikka_masala
and thumbs_up for_the_naan and the_okra dish
that_said
many_of_the dishes simply fall flat
problem is
at
this_is_one_of_the more expensive non strip buffets and_it_is simply just_not spectactular
wow
driving down flamingo and_saw a_couple_of indian_food joints
ghandi had_an authentic feel
after going inside_and seeing a buffet_style set_up
i_was_a_little thrown off
after asking the_lady
she explained you_can either do_the buffet_or order_off_the_menu
i_decided_to stay because_there were_so many_people there
the_food_was_so good
so_good_that i_went_back for_dinner the_same night
for_dinner i_ordered off_the_menu
there_is no_buffet at_night anyways
and i_cannot believe_the results
the_food off_the_menu was_even better_than_the buffet
which_was already some_of_the_best_indian_food i've_had
i_will_be eating_here every chance i_get every_time i'm_in_vegas
favs
chicken_masala
lentil_soup
basmati_rice
garlic_naan
the_dessert buffet
make_sure_to combine them
awesome customer_service
we visit_this_place every_time_we are in_vegas
but_on dec th they_only_had dinner_buffet and_when_we told the_manager
laddi
we_were leaving cause we_couldn't order our favorite_dish
malai paneer
he_had the_kitchen make_it for_us
we_felt so special_and taken_care of
u guys gotta try_this_place
u wont be_disappointed
lunch_buffet
food_was_ok
ridiculous
utterly ridiculous
i_just called and attempted to_place an_order by telephone
i_was promptly asked to_call back in_minutes
what_kind_of business asks a potential customer to_call back
i apologized for bothering them_and informed them that_i wouldn't_be giving_them my business
sorry about_it
when_we entered the_restaurant
the_buffet time was_almost over
erik kept the_buffet on hold for_us and_even arranged for fresh_and_hot roti
totally adds a_star to_our trip_to_vegas
worst customer_service
the dude doesn't even know_where the guest are seated
allotted our_table twice to others while we_are grabbing the_food from buffet
we've been_going here_for years_and today was_very likely the_last_time
sad_to say
the_parking_lot was_surprisingly empty_and i_guess we now know_why
my_wife normally loves the_tandori_chicken but today it_was extremely dry_and unedible
we_told our_waiter about_it and_he takes the piece_of dry chicken from our_table_and takes it_to_the back kitchen_and seemed_to tell the_cook that the_chicken_was bad
well
no follow up
no apology and_he seemed_to laugh it_off with_the female waitress that seemed_to be flipping the dry pieces
just picking at them
i've kind of noticed the_food_was getting lower in_quality lately
but_didn't say much since_it_was my wife's favorite indian_lunch_buffet
even_the solidly prepared mango_lassi was_full_of ice pieces
didn't_taste good and_didn't arrive to_the_table until my_plate was nearly finished
i didn't_even go for_seconds
since_there really wasn't anything worth going_back_for
we_have other choices for_indian_food_and next_time it won't be here
maybe_they changed owners
i_went for_dinner_and ordered_the_tandoori chicken
it_was_very tender_and flavorful
the_atmosphere_is also_great
i_am on atkins diet lately and i_highly_recommend their_tandoori_chicken
one order is more_than enough_for even two people
i_had_a great_experience when i_ate_here a_few_days ago
i started_with_the tandoori mix grill
this plate had_a_nice mix_of chicken
lamb
and prawns
it_all tasted_great
for the_main_course we_had_the chicken_tikka_and the prawn curry
both these_dishes had just_the_right_amount_of spices_and filled_with taste
if_you_have never_tried indian_cuisine
make sure this_is_the st indian_restaurant you_try
the_food will not_disappoint
worst food_we had_in_vegas
couple_of my_friend_had stomach ache after eating_here
also for_the_price its not_worth
will_not recommend anybody to_go_here
also the_parking_lot was_empty
now we know_why it_was empty
the_buffet_was amazing and_the_service_was prompt
lamb_curry was_tender_and delicious
the_samosa was_the_best i_have_ever_had and_the mango_custard was a_perfect finish
i_would_highly_recommend this_restaurant
very_clean_and hygienic
love_the ambience_and openness
much better_than overcrowded restaurants right on_the_strip
service is_awesome
waiters_are very_kind
always available and seem_to want you_to ask_them for things
food_is absolutely_amazing
i've_never_had better_indian_food in_my_life
tastes very_fresh
chicken_dishes are_very juicy and succulent
other_indian_restaurants just_don't match up_to the_quality_of_food
i would_definitely_recommend_this_place to_everyone
my vegas trip was complete after coming_here
i'm definitely coming back
one_of_my_favorite_indian restaurants ever
the layout makes_you feel at_home and helps enjoy your experience
the_staff_is great and_friendly
the_food_is_outstanding
the_lamb was_cooked_to_perfection which is_hard_to find
the_menu offers a_lot_of variety for_both meat_eaters and vegetarians
i_will_be_coming back for_sure
i_try to_find an_indian_restaurant_in almost every city i_visit because i_love_it so
i've made three visits to gandhi's while in_vegas_and every_time have_had an_excellent meal_with great_service
i've even visited the_lunch_buffet
lunch_buffets can_be mediocre and_are often bland
but_not at gandhi's
good_stuff
bacchanal buffet my ass
gandhi buffet it_is
the food_tastes fresh
there_is variety_and its delicious
what's not_to like for_a hungover group_of guys
i_had_a sampling_of everything but stuck to_my dal chaawal staple which_was perfect_for me
they_have idli
sambhar and upma too for the_average south_indian
when a_buffet costs
you_would think they_would invest in cutlery
nope
although_the plates are ceramic
very_light
the cups are 'take out' material cups and_the spoons look metallic but_they_are 'faux' metal spoons
the fork bent while cutting into_my idli
haha
come_on guys
invest a_bit_more
will_be_back
went_there and_the_food_was decent but_the_service_was aweful
my_girlfriend and_i_were the_only_ones in_there and_they took_forever_to come_back_to our_table or_even bring the_check
we_just wanted_to leave
good_value_for your buck
very_close_to the_strip
what happened here
when_i_was here_for_dinner a_little over a_year_ago
the_buffet
the matter_paneer in particular
was fan flippin tastic
service_was_great
the_food_was_amazing
and_i swore an oath to myself that_i_would somehow come_back_here
i_was_in vegas with_my fianc this past weekend and
even though he's not big on_indian_food
i talked him into having dinner_here because_of how_good it_was
womp womp
did they change ownership
there's no such thing as_a dinner_buffet anymore
well
i_can't eat embarrassing amounts at_the_buffet
but_at least i_can order_the matter_paneer off_the_menu
i_thought
there_was one nice host busser
one food runner
and_one disinterested waiter
which got to_be_a problem as the_dinner crowd picked up
the_naan_was sub par
more burnt air bubbles than_anything
my beloved matter_paneer was totally different
it_wasn't_bad
actually
it_was_pretty decent
but nowhere near as_good_as_it used_to_be
we_sat at_the_table
done eating
plates cleared
for_a loooong time before i_was_able_to practically tackle the_waiter_to get our_check
had i_never been here_before
this_would have_been_a
rounded up_to stars to_be generous experience
but knowing what_was and_what could_have been
this mostly left_me disappointed and apologizing to_my fianc for misleading him
the tomato_soup was_out_of the_world
the_most delicious i_ever_had
better_than many restaurents in_india
my_family_and i_used_to go_to_this_place all_the_time to_get_our indian fix but ever_since they_got new_management the_food started tasting different_and the_overall quality went don't
seriously they don't_even give_you real glasses or utensils to_use
they_also let go the_best servers which really made_the place_so welcoming_and
homey
had this_place last_night and_it_was_very_good
ordered_the_tandoori mixed_grill
chicken_tikka_masala
paneer kadhai and all_three dishes_were hot and_flavorful
the service_was_a_bit_slow and since_there were_only few other_tables being used thought_it would've been_better
maybe_they were_a_little short on staff since_it_was a_tuesday night
would've given stars_if the_service more on_the spot
the food_was_ok at_best
we_want on monday in_the after noon and it_looks_like they_were serving food left_over from the_past weekend
why was_i surprised
after_all this_place_has many two star_review
i_guess because i've_eaten here_before and_thought the_food_was_pretty_good
but_there's more_to a_restaurant than the_quality_of_the_food
so briefly here's my prob with_this_place
first
they raise their_prices when_they feel it's appropriate christmas week
yes
the_week
not the_day
how do_you justify with_no additional menu_items
next
naan_is part_of the_buffet_and good_but dry most buffets serve fresh_naan at_the_table
there_was no patek paneer i_know
amazing huh
finally
the_plastic silverware was_just too_much
buffet_with plastic silverware
so_i gave this_place another_chance for_dinner_and lunch
it_was_pretty_good still not_a_big_fan_of the obvious downgrade on_the silverware department but_the_food_was much better keep_it up
lots_of tasty vegetarian_dishes even though i'm_a meat lover
i_was_quite surprised_that the_lunch_buffet was_more_than_enough
spices_were just_right
flavorful_and a plethora of_dishes including dessert
i_would_have given it a_star but the_location and_atmosphere needs improvement
be_prepared_to walk_away satisfied and_extremely full
love the_ambience here
food_is just_ok
we_had buffet_here
the_food_was_not so fresh_and_hot
the_owner_was generous_and nice man
this_place_is awesome_and so_far the_best indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
long weekends they always_have lunch_and_dinner buffet_which is_fabulous and_their food_is_awesome as_well
whenever we_come to_vegas we_just eat_here
we_are vegetarians_and they always_have lot_of options_for us compare_to other_restaurants
we_love this_place_and recommend_to all vegetarians indian_food lovers
the_service_was_very poor
the_atmosphere very average
food_was_good
even_though_we were_not ask if_we_wanted our_food mild so our_food_was hot flavored
price was_ok till u realize that_all food_is a_la_carte
i_did_not realize rice_was extra with_your curry
so be_sure_to get_your side otherwise you_will disappointed
overall
i_will_not come_here
fresh_food
excellent taste_and very_nice new owner
i tried_a_few others and_had_to go_back_to gandhi time and_again
buffet was_excellent too and_when ordered service_was_quick compared_to their competitors
i_was a_big_fan and_still am a_fan_of gandhi
but_there r a_few major things i_would_like them to_change
first
please do_not let us use plastic silverware and plastic water cups
secondly
if customers are in_the_restaurant
no matter if it_is time to_close
keep the_environment cool
don't switch off_the a c mins before closing
it_gets really hot on_a summer afternoon
unlike in_the_past
there r now many_other comparable indian_restaurants_in_vegas
i_recommend not giving your most faithful customers any reason_to move to competitors
i_have_to_say that the_good was_decent
now i_am_an indian and_i eat_at indian_restaurants_in nj and india all_the_time
service really need_to_be worked on or they_will have_a hard time
for_an_indian_restaurant in_the_us i_was_quite impressed that_their plates_and cups were clean
restrooms
like_all indian_restaurants were dirty and overfilled with fabreez
while_we_were there paying the_check they_had_a call from_a customer complaining about an delivery and it_was_not handled professionally while there_were many others listening to_her on_the_phone
small changes and_they could_be the_best place_to_eat indian_food_in_vegas
good_food
i_was_surprised to find_that they_charge for_rice though
on the_side_of curry
doesn't that usually come_with it
and
the_waiter told_me that i_couldn't order one_of_the curries because_i_was not_indian
i_think he meant it_as_a warning about the_spice but_never the_less i_thought_it_was funny and_worth mentioning
fyi the wifi password is
iloveganhdi
this_place_is as_good_as_the other_indian_restaurants that i've_been_to in_las_vegas
the_food_is_very_good
the_portions_are still small
but if_i go_with someone else
i_can usually finish their plates as_well
one_thing that stands out is the_decor
it is_beautiful
high ceilings
indian nick knacks hanging all_over_the place
linen table cloths
etc
the_service_is fast
and_the_prices_are in_line with other_indian_restaurants in_the_area
i_will_go_back if_i'm ever on_that side_of_town again
rrally awesome_food
malai paneer was_excellent_and butter naan_was too good
even lassi_was great_too
gandhi is_awesome
please don't take_my word for_it
go try_their fish tikka_and fish pakora and_i bet you you'll fall in_love_with it
this comes from_a foodie who loves authentic fish
some_of_the_best_indian_food in_las_vegas
their_naan is_to_die_for and the_chicken_tiki_masala is mouth_watering
their_lunch_buffet_is damn_good too
if_you_like_indian_food
you_have_to try_this_place
the_only_place we_go for_indian besides my kitchen
they_have_some awesome indian_beers too
try the_mango dessert
be_warned
the_vindaloo wasn't spicy_at_all
the_tandoori tikka_masala rock
i_love_it
i_love_it
i_love_it
until around a_year_ago
this_was_the_best indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas and remains a_favorite
on_our most recent visit we ordered_naan
basmati_rice
chicken_tika marsala and rata lamb
we_received naan
basmati_rice
chicken_tika marsala and rata chicken
not a_problem because_we have_never_had rata chicken_or rata lamb or rata anything for_that matter
each entre was both flavorful_and spicy
service remains attentive
i_can't_say i'm an_expert_on_indian cuisine but_this_is my_fav spot in_las_vegas
i_know the_location_is questionable at_best but_the_food_is worth_it
best_naan in_town
saag_paneer
chicken_tiki_masala and vegetable_korma are_great
lunch_buffet_is but_it's a_great_way_to try an assortment_of what they_have to_offer
the_place_is small_but it adds to the_ambiance
out_of all_the_indian_restaurants i've tried in_vegas
this_is_the_best so_far
and i'm_pretty picky seeing as_i grew up in_an_indian household with awesome homecooked indian_food almost everyday
the_buffet lunches are your best bet
because you_can_try everything for hella cheap
my favorite_is_the chicken_tikki_masala
saag_paneer
and_of_course
their_naan
if you're into yogurt drinks
try_the sweet lassi
yummilicious
the_way i_found_the india_palace was_to ask_the locals where_they go
over_and over_the recommendation was_the india_palace
this_place_is consistently good
never fails to please and_i've_been going_here for_years
make_a point_of at_least_one meal_here on every vegas visit
can't_go_wrong here
great_service
great_food
great_price
this_place is_small_and somewhat hidden
their_food_is pretty_good
i'd tried almost_all of_them and they_all taste good
i_would_come back_to_this_place
they_had mango_custard and_rice_pudding dessert
rather dark inside
definitely unassuming from the_outside
a_bit skeptical to_give_it_a shot after cruising through the_neighborhood but pleasantly_surprised that_i_did
an earlier reviewer was_right
you can't_go_wrong here
as spicy_as you_like
i_like
with tastefully exotic ambience
well_worth_the cab fare from_the bellagio
there_were of us_that ate_at this crowded and cramped place
with stinky overflowing restrooms in_las_vegas
the_food_was_delicious
some_dishes could_be less greased with butter
but_overall the_food_was_good in_comparison to mid range indian_restaurants_in_the us although_it_was priced higher than_most in_its range
the_wait was long_as there_are few tables to seat
restrooms were absolutely a disaster with things overflowing with_no attention from the_owners
a common problem_with most_indian_restaurants like this_one
if the_food_is_good
the_price_is high but_no funds are diverted to keeping the_restaurant clean for_a clean experience
where does all_the cash go not_to the poor low cost undocumented workers
ok
so were from san_francisco
which arguably has the_best cuisine in_the u
s
so_this may be_a_bit biased
the_food_is not_that_great
we_went_for_the buffet_and_it_was really bland
but_there_were a_lot_of_indian and bangladeshis in_the_place
which makes_me think_it must_be the_only game in_town
this_review_is_for_the buffet_only
after_reading_the reviews of_this_place
i_was lead to believe_it is_the_best_indian place_in_vegas
after eating_here my thoughts are
this_is_the_only indian place_in_vegas not likely
people in_vegas have_never_had good_indian_food
people in_vegas don't know what good_indian_food is
my thinking is either or
the_food
an assortment_of curries which all lack that usual tasteful magicness found_in indian_cuisine
the consistency was_fine
i've_been_to some places_that have real watery curries
but_the blending of_spices came out bland_and not_good
the_naan although fluffy tasted like burnt popcorn
i_have_to_say the_one saving grace was the_rice_pudding
kheer
was_actually quite_good
i_went_back for_seconds
the_atmosphere
typical for_an_indian_restaurant
my_water_glass was_filled at appropriate times
they_had pleasant light music_playing
as opposed_to obnoxious bollywood videos
and_the_decor is_fine
i_have_to_say i_did_not venture into the_bathroom as_i_was afraid for my_life
the_next_time i_am_in_vegas i_will skip this_one
my_brother found this_restaurant
asking local folks where_they went for_indian_food
certainly the_outside of_it would_never have attracted us
but ooooh
the_food
the_lamb_curry was_good
the_chicken_vindaloo was delish
and the_goat_curry
yes
goat_curry
was_to_die_for
service_was swift and_friendly
the_decor_was odd a cross between new delhi and someone's living room but_that went weirdly well_with_the sense that_this_was
in_fact
some fabulous home cooking
when an_indian woman gushes to_me about an_indian_restaurant
i_usually take her word for_it and rush over there_and expect_a good_meal
i_mean
i_just assumed that_she should get_to decide what good_indian_food was
anyway
that's_not the_point
after we_paid and_we_were waiting_for a_cab
a_bunch_of men standing by the_door gave_us_a handful_of seed looking things from the_restaurant counter
they_put a_handful in_their mouth and chewed with glee
and_told_us to_eat_it
and it_tasted_like soap pepper seeds
and_i kept thinking
what the_hell was_that
why did_i just eat that
anyway
that's_not the_point either
the_point is
i_forgot the left_over chicken ticca in_the trunk of_my car
for two_days
but_after two_days it_was totally fine and my_dad still ate it and_said it_was_good
five_stars
best chicken_tikka_masala i've encountered
it's_also one_of_the_few places_that ever has dosas readily available and the_service_is_good
since moving_to the_bay_area
i've noticed_that india_palace_is a_bit_pricey for_indian_food
but considering_that it_tastes better_than all_the_indian places_i've gone_to here in_the_bay
i'd say_that it's_worth_it
las_vegas lacks a_variety_of quality ethnic places
luckily
there_are few_places like india_palace that make up_for_it
i_had_the buffet today
i_don't_think_i can give a_fair comprehensive review til i've ordered from_the_menu
buffet_is_a different animal
ey
but the_buffet_was damn_good
i don't_eat much meat
but_i_just drizzled the_sauces from the_meat_dishes all_over my rice_and sopped up_with naan
flat_bread
i_agree_with the_other_reviews that the_naan was_a_little burnt
but maybe that's intentional
it_was_still fluffy and_i kind of like_my foods on_the charred side anyways
adds character
the_naan_is not on_the_buffet_line
but a_waiter will drop it_on your_table
i'm assuming so it_doesn't dry out under_the lamps of_the_buffet
nice_touch
indians
the meatball sauce was_awesome
on_the sweet side_and i_went_back for_seconds and thirds
the_saag_paneer
spinach_and cheese
was_also_good
but the_paneer cubes were scant
the kahari goat
house favorite
was a_little_on_the salty side
but_still_good
on the_dinner_menu
this_dish is
the_kheer
rice_pudding
was_good
too
not_too_sweet
but_still sweeter than others i've_had
their samosas_were okay
i_like samosa factory's mo bettah
they_offer a_couple_different chutneys
cilantro and
mango maybe
they_also served raita
chicken_tandoori
aloo_tikki
little fried potato chunks
like_indian tater tots
and mango_custard
everything i_had_was yummy
they_have_a fat seafood menu
too
but_no seafood dishes were_offered in_the_buffet
at least not when_we_went
their dinner_menu looks out_of control good
i'm gonna have to_go_back
a_lot
the_buffet_had a_really_good variety for_only
manfriend got_a salt lassi
which_was not too_salty
for_two buffets_and one drink
the_bill came_out_to
the_restaurant_is in_a free standing building on twain
east of paradise
dangerously close_to school
small parking_lot
the_interior was_surprisingly well_decorated
there's elaborate wood carvings and_indian illustrations decorating the_walls
the_walls are painted flat planes of colors
similar_to indian_spices
the_restaurant_is pleasantly under lit
they_don't just sport the_name
fine indian_cuisine
for fun
tables are elegantly set_up with linens and all_that fancy crap
waitstaff is nicely dressed in uniform
the bar_is constructed with a_solid dark wood and_there's a_large flat screen behind_the bar playing shitty bollywood movies
no audio
the nice_decor is surprising because most authentically ethnic restaurants_are designed as_an after thought
like in old country
when_we_went in
lunch_time on_a monday
we were_only the_second party
by_the_time_we left
there_were about eight parties
off_the_strip
non casino
mmmm has_a_great buffet all_you_can_eat buffet_for_lunch for_a_good price
it's monday through sunday
they_have just remodeled so there's_a bar added_to it as_well_as_a larger area to_sit
i_have_been eating at_india_palace for ten years
imagine my_surprise when_i my_favorite_indian_restaurant now completely renovated
the_building is_now very modern_and upgraded
i had_the_lunch_buffet today_and was_pleasantly_surprised that chicken_tika_masala is_now part_of_the buffet
still my_favorite menu item
i_highly_recommend_the lunch_buffet if_this_is your first foray into indian_cuisine
my_only quibble is_that_the dinner_menu averages per entree
a_little_high
but well_worth_it in_my_opinion
my_wife_and_i have waited to_try_the india_palace we_were looking_forward_to it_very_much
but_what a_disappointment
the_place_was not clean
the_service_was awful
the_food_was
let me say passable at_best and nowhere to park
i_had_the_chicken vidaloo
the_chicken_was fatty and_chewy with_three pieces_of_chicken
although_it_was spicey enough_for me
the utensiles were dirty and the_plates were_not clean enough_for me
being from london where_the indian_restaurants_are excellant i_can assure you_that our_first_time will_be our_last
you_will_get the_customer once but_to stay_in business you_have_to attract customers back_and on_this showing we wont be_going back
john
las_vegas
india_palace closed for a_few_months to renovate
a_few very sad months for_some friends_and_i
it completely changed its decor completely modern now and_the lighting so_much_better
food is_still excellent and_i_will come_back every chance i_get
hip location_and atmosphere
and_the_food_was above_average as_well
veggie pakoras_were outstanding
and_i_loved the_red chili chutney that_is served alongside the_mint and_tamarind
northern_indian entrees_were rather good
but_the dosai were_very average
sambar was watery_and low in_flavor
it_was_the surprisingly pleasant facade that brought_us to_india_palace on_a_sunday evening
as_we drove through the_parking_lot
we_were stunned to_see_how busy it_was
the private lot was_packed and we_took the_last parking space
there_were still cars coming in as_we walked into the_restaurant
could there be private event
as i_took_a quick peek in
it_didn't seem like_it_was closed for_a party
we_took the_last of_the_two tables available
which_was our luck since the_rest_of our_dinner there_was a_large_group of_people waiting
checking_out our fellow diners
and_we_were surrounded by indians and_non indians
this_place_was was ridiculously busy
as a_result
it_took awhile to_get_our orders in_and for_our_food to_come
it_looked_like a new_restaurant inside with_the simple decorations and complementing paint choices
as_other yelper mentioned
they_just renovated
a lone tv behind_the bar showed bollywood videos throughout_the_meal
they_also have two smaller rooms off to_the sides
the husband_and_i both ordered a_mango_lassi
sweet yogurt based shake made_with mango pulp
to_start and_it_was probably one of_the_best_i've_had
presented in_a copper cup
i_would_say they_give_you more_than other_places do
we_both chose a_dinner special
which_comes with chicken_or dal soup
choice_of bread plain_naan
garlic_naan
or roti
basmatic rice_and mango_custard
the_dal soup
a traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils
was simple
but_tasty
a_nice start_to our_meal
the_garlic_naan_was a_generous amount
and we_actually had_leftovers
it_was tasty with_lots_of garlic
my vegetable dinner special included
saag_paneer
navratan korma
dal_makhani
raita
the_saag_paneer
creamy spicy spinach with chunks_of homemade cheese
is_usually a_favorite of_the husband's
so_i let him have most_of_it
it_was_good
but not_my_favorite
the navratan korma
mixed veggies with cheese in_a creamy_sauce with cashews
almonds raisins
was a_favorite though
probably because i_love creamy sauces in indian_cooking
the dal_makhani
lentil delicacy flavored with_onions
tomatoes
ginger
garlic cream
was_also_very_good as_well
because i_love lentils_and cream
the_raita
yogurt seasoned with cumin
cucumber
tomatoes mint
has_never been something i_could enjoy
so the_husband enjoyed most_of_it
the_husband went_for_the rack of_lamb dinner special
rack of_lamb
malai_kofta
aloo matar
the_malai_kofta
cheese vegetable balls in_an aromatic gravy
was_a_bit interesting
as_we would_say
it's considered a
house favorite
but it_was_just a_bit weird for_us
the_aloo matar
green peas cooked_with diced potatoes_and aromatic spices in_a curry_sauce
was_yummy
as_most indian_curry dishes_are
the rack of_lamb was_also_good
and loaded with tons_of onions_and bell peppers
which the_husband ate up
the mango_custard was_a light simple liquid custard drink with chunks_of fruit in_it
not exactly_what_i call a custard
but more_like_a thicker lassi
service_was okay when our_waiter finally took_our_order
the_food_took awhile and_our bill took awhile too
the women serving the_food could use a_little brush up_on how to_clear a_table
simple things_like clearing the_soup bowls before bringing out the_other food might help a_bit
we_were_seated at a_small table
so_it_was crowded with all_our mini dishes
overall
india_palace served up_some good_indian_food
in_general
i_love_the intense spices used in indian_cooking
and_you definitely get_it here
i_can't_say how authentic it_is
but from_the many indians eating_there
i take that_as a_good_sign
it_is_a_bit pricey though compared_to_other_indian restaurants
i_would_be giving this_place_a but_they really_really irritated me
ok so all_that aside
the_selection_is good the_atmosphere_is good
the two_times i_have_eaten there the_food_was imo overly salty but_not enough_to keep_me away
now the_third time_i_go in_there
they_were down right rude
there_was no_one in_there and_we asked_if_we could sit_in the_little room by the_windows
yes we_asked politely and_were answered by
no
sit here
points to dark dark corner by some older lady who seemed_to be having a_bad day
i responded by gently telling her we_did_not want to_sit_in the dark corner and we_wanted_to read a_bit while we_ate so
we_asked again if_there_was anyway we_could sit here or is_there some_reason we can't
no
sit here
points to dark dark corner
oh man so_i stood there a_second wondering if maybe we_were having_a language barrier issue and_this nice old lady wasn't intentionally being rude
so_i look to_the young man who_was holding the ice water pitcher
he looked_like the woman scared him hitless and_he pretty much tried_to usher us to_the dark seats
oh man
so_i turn to my_girlfriend_and we_both walk right back out the_door
we_went_to india_oven down on_sahara and las_vegas blvd
instead
and_yes they_have good_food and_good_service
they_even let us_in before_they were_really open for_the_lunch_buffet
well
i_had tried origin india
tamba
bollywood grill
and india_oven
none_of them compare_to the tastes of india_palace that_i experienced in oct
everything tasted_great
from the_mango_lassi to the_chicken_tikka_masala
the only_negative was_that_the waiter's indian accent was_very thick_and he tended to_speak quickly
so_he wasn't always easy_to understand even_for a_well traveled person like myself
still
i'm yet to_find_a better indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
i dropped in with_a buddy for_the_lunch_buffet
it_was_ok
the fare is standard for an_indian_place
lamb_curry
chicken_tikka_masala
naan_bread
here's a tip if you offer a_buffet
don't bother offering salad if all you're_going_to have_is iceburg lettuce and canned fruit
i'm glad they honored the_coupon for_the_buffet
and_the_service_was polite_and good
terrible_service but good_food
pretty pricy for_curry
if you wanna see the_most unfriendly servers
this is_the_place_to_go
i_will_never go_back there
tho
last_night in_vegas
my_girlfriend_and i_wanted_to eat somewhere off_the_strip and have_some good_indian_food
we are_both glad we_found_this_place
ok it may_not be_in the_best_part_of town
but_the_food more_than makes_up_for_it
appetizers
complimentary flat breads with dipping_sauces
entrees
lamb_curry chicken_tikka_masala
sides
keemon naan and_plain_naan
everything_was oh_so good
i_don't_really eat too_much indian_food
maybe because_i'm worried that_i'm going_to_get bad indian_food
but_i'm glad we_went_here
first_thing you notice when_you_walk in
is_that everyone that_is sitting_in the_restaurant_is indian
ok
so they're all_indian this_place must_be good
and_yes it_was
for_sure we_are going_to_have to_go back_here_again if and_when_we are in_vegas
wife_and_i tried_the_lunch_buffet at_india_palace and_found it_to_be ok
but unremarkable and_a_little under spiced
the_restaurant_is rather pleasant compared_to some_of_the strip_mall establishments that vegas indian_places can_be
but_i_just didn't_have my socks blown off enough_for a_repeat visit or to want to_sample the_dinner_menu
sunday_night
january
indian_food heaven
my_bf yelped this_place while_we_were thinking of a_place_to grub my last_night in_vegas before heading back_home monday morning
when_we first walked_in
i_thought
wow
tons_of indian customers_and wow
very classy spot
we started_off with_some flat breads and a_couple_different dipping_sauces
very_delicious
for_our_entrees we_ordered_the chicken_tikka_masala_and_the lamb_curry and_of_course being total mcfatties we_ordered different_types_of naan_bread
ohhhh how i_love naan_and ohhhh how they_made them just_right
and to_finish off_with dessert we_ordered some_indian ice_cream
i_had_the pistachio and_he ordered the_mango
very_different
but_very good_as_well
the_service_was_also quite excellent
i_definitely didn't_think we'd find an_awesome indian_restaurant as this_one that_night
definitely gotta try_this_place out_if you're ever in_vegas_and looking to_dine off_the_strip
i'm a_huge_fan_of this_place
wonderful
wonderful indian_food
i've_eaten here four times in_the_last months and_each_time everything's been terrific
highly
highly_recommend
so
diamond palace in diamond bar
ca had the_best chicken_tikka_masala as of yet
well
i_have finally discovered
so_far
the winner of_that title
it now belongs to_india_palace in_las_vegas
nv
it is_located a_mile east of_the_strip
the_neighborhood seems run down but the_restaurant_is beautfully decorated and_modern looking
the flavours of the_chicken_tikka_masala were_perfect
i_ordered mine spicy_and_it had just_the_right_amount_of kick
it_was unanimous within our_group of_indian_food lovers that_this_was the_best_place we've_had yet
the_waiter recommended the_rice dish pea pulao
which contained white basmati_rice
peas
yellow raisins
and either peanuts or cashews
can't remember
he said_it_was more special and_flavorful than_the regular rice
it_was_good also
but_i prefer_the plain_rice
the_naan_was perfect as_well
but who could mess that up
i_am sad that_it_is so_far away because_i can't eat_it often
but luckily i_visit las_vegas a_few_times a_year and it_will make_it that much_more special to anticipate eating_it
i_will_never hit_the casino buffets anymore and opt to_go_to india palace's buffet instead
now that's money well spent
zagat rated pretty much indicates that a_restaurant is_quite excellent
and_they're correct with_this_place
best_indian_food_in_vegas so_far
the_only_place that i_know of_that knocks this_place out_of_the map would_be curry in_a_hurry back_in ny
but
this_place_will do
unless i_visit ny again
go_for buffet during_lunch
great_price and_selection
best_indian_lunch_buffet in_a town where_the indian_lunch_buffets i've tried aren't particularly fantastic
no comments on any non buffet action as i_haven't_had it
located right near_the convention center for_all of_you out_of towners
but_also not_in_a particularly_good neighborhood the further you head away from_the_strip
still though
if_you're_in that area_of town it's a_pretty_good meal
their_lunch_buffet_is nice
their north_indian dishes_are really_really_good
good ambience
the_dosa is_also nice but huge
basic veggies like okra are just_ok
but_the paneer_and cholle etc are really_nice
if_it_were in_my hands i_would_give this_place negative ratings
i_am_an india_and i_have_been_to all sort of indian_restaurants_in us_and in_india
so let me start my part_of experience_here
me_and_my friends went_here reading all_the nice yelp_reviews
we_ordered some appetizers
some sabji
naan_and mysore masala_dosa
the_waiter took_our_order and asked_us if we_want the sabji spicy or medium_spicy
we_said medium_spicy would_be good
so_he brings everything from started_to the sabji and_naan in_order
the starters were_okay and sabji was totally bland
we could_easily say
since_i have_some cooking experience
that_the mixed_vegetable sabji was_made out_of frozen ready made cut vegetables
partially cooked_and lacking all_the spices_that make_it indian
but we_did_not complain because_we thought_that it_might_be because we_said medium_spicy
so
after we_all but_my poor friend_who had_ordered the_dosa
were_done with our_lunch
they_bring the_dosa
the sambhar is sour like lemonade
we_did_not complain about_it
but_the mysore dosa_is full_of red chilli powder
she
could barely eat two pieces_of it
so
we call_the waiter_and tell him that_we find_it to spicy
he starts explaining us_that we_don't know what an actual mysore masala tastes_like
and tells us_that since_we have_not eaten an actual mysore masala in_the_city of mysore in_india we cannot complain about_it
so
i informed him that_i_am from_india and i_have_eaten mysore masala for more_than years and_yes in mysore too and_its never this spicy
he_made faces and_so i_told_him that_its their mistake because_they should_have mentioned that_it_is very_spicy in their_menu
so
he_got a_bit scared and offered_us some complimentary dessert
which_we obviously denied and_left the_place paying_for everything
with bad taste in_our mouth
wow
the renovation has really improved the_ambiance of_this_place
great_job
so much_more open
with a_lot_more space
some_good bollywood videos on the_tv
low lighting
nice
anyway
the_lunch_buffet
has several vegan_options
one_of which_is masala_dosa
i_know
you're freaking out
you_have been_looking_for an_indian_place that_even serves dosa
much less has it on_the_buffet
well
this_is_a blessing and_a curse
masala_dosa should be eaten immediately after it_comes off_the griddle
which does not happen at a_buffet
but if_you_can hold out til you_see a_fresh batch brought out
it's pretty_good
and the_sambar to_go_with was_super tasty
bad news though
their coconut_chutney has dairy in_it
the_server was_very_helpful pointing out_the vegan_friendly dishes
pakora
rice
chana_masala
cabbage
dosa
sambar
some salad stuff
they_will also bring_you
vegan
roti upon request instead_of naan
it's_an a_ok place
a_nice_change of pace from the_usual trip across_the_street to_mint
oh
and meat_eaters apparently you_must try_the meatballs and_the_goat
that_was_the word around the_table
can't confirm personally
i've_been_to india_palace a_number_of times_now_and would_say it's one_of_my_favorite indian_restaurants_in_las_vegas
the_neighborhood is_a_little sketchy
but_don't let that fool_you
this_place_is worth_it
a_few people i_know used_to not_like this_place_because it_was_really dumpy
i_never saw how it_used_to look
but the_place_was renovated a_couple years_ago and_is quite_nice now
even the_people who used_to not_like going_there have returned
the_menu items_are typical of_what you_will find_at most_indian_restaurants
however
they_have_a number_of southern_indian foods that_i_was not_familiar_with
one_dish
the_dosa
is_something i_would_highly_recommend to_anyone
essentially
it_is_a gigantic crepe filled_with ground potato_and onion
to give_you an idea_of the_size
it's probably about inches long
inches wide
and_an inch thick
if_you_want to_make_it amazing
you_can ask_them to include ground lamb
it's_not on_the_menu
but_for an_extra few bucks
it's overwhelmingly worth_it
it_comes_with two sauces
sambar and coconut_chutney
i've never cared much_for coconut
but everyone else always thinks they go well together
paired with their_naan varieties
you_really can't lose
the_tandoori
masala
and_everything else i've tried has_been very_good
additionally
they_have_a lunch_buffet_for about that's worth checking_out
overall
if_you_are looking_for_good indian
this_is somewhere you need_to_go
it's_a rather sad thing_that i_don't frequent indian_restaurants
being ethnically indian
i_should be galloping to_the nearest indian_place to gorge on_the curries_and breads but_i never do
the_first reason is_that for the_most_part
the indian_buffets or restaurants leave me_with a_very uneasy stomach
the_second reason is_that a_lot_of_indian restaurants leave something to_be_desired in_the hygiene department
i'm happy to_say_that india_palace has somewhat alleviated my prejudices against indian_restaurants
esp the_ones in_las_vegas
we_went_on_a sunday_afternoon
they_serve a_lunch_buffet
bucks
every_day
the_restaurant_was packed
and_it_was quite well_decorated
muted romantic colors
nice lighting
wow
a refreshing change_from_the usual indian_buffet experience
one_of_my friends' went_for_the buffet_which had_about dishes and_a multitude of salads
yogurt dipping_sauces and deserts
my_husband has partaken in_the_buffet before_and both of_them had_only good_things to say_about the_buffet
as_i_was feeling not_too hungry
i_decided_to have_something from_their dosa menu
i_ordered an onion_and chili oothapam
thick pancake made_from fermented idli dosa batter
the batter needs to_have_a distinct sour taste and_it_is topped generously with onion veggies or whatever you fancy
this_was served_with_a sambar and coconut_chutney
the oothapam itself was_pretty_good and the_sambar although definitely_not authentic traditional south_indian sambar
certainly tasted_good
my_friend_had a paper dosa_which was crisp_and tasty_and my_husband_had_the mysore masala_dosa
dosa stuffed_with a_spicy potato masala_with some spicy chutney in_it
i_was_pretty stoked to_eat south_indian dosas in_vegas_and have_it taste good_and be_seated in_a relatively nice establishment
the service_was_a_bit crazy
they_had about waiters waitresses and_no_one was wearing any sort of uniform
all the_wait_staff were indian_and so were the_customers
imagine my confusion and uncertainty when calling for service
my_husband also_had_the chai and_said it_was_really_good
he_didn't leave any for me_to_try so i'd_have to_take his word for_it
i_ordered coffee
although_not the_traditional filter coffee served_in south_india
the combination_of the coffee and dosa made_for a_very satisfying lunch
i'd_definitely go_back_for their dosa offerings
the_vegetarian_dishes was_okay
i_did enjoy_the cabbage dish and_i_believe it_is called kutu
anyway
it_was fresh_and_tasty
the_vegetables was cooked_perfectly right
not_too soggy and_still had_a fresh crisp at each bite
i didn't_eat as_much
but_i_was extremely full right away
i_wonder if_the myth about buffets is_true
you_know
the myth of putting something in all_of_the_food that makes_you full fast so_you don't_eat as_much and waste any food
well
my_stomach seems_to think_that the_buffet myth applies to_india_palace
it_feels_like i_ate a_whole roast pig
i_just feel awkwardly bloated and_full from eating a_few vegetarian_dishes
i_am_not_sure if_i would_come_back
considering_that the_lunch_buffet_is
the_waiter also_had poor listening skills
the_bill was
my_friend_had cash and_i_had_a card
we_told the_waiter_to bring back_in change and put the_rest on_the card
simple enough right
he put into_the bill_and charged
on_the card
ay yay yay
i_had_a hankering for_indian_food_and had_been meaning to_try india_palace
i grabbed a_friend_and we headed on our_way
as_others have_said
the_neighborhood is_a_bit sketchy
the_restaurant_is nice_inside and looks recently renovated
the_staff was_extremely_friendly and seated_us right away
the_food_is_good
really_good
they immediately brought_us papadum and_a_few various sauces
we_ordered some_garlic_naan
delicious
and_the bombay fish
decent
we_ordered chicken_tikka_masala_and reshami chicken along_with two_orders_of basmati_rice
i_ordered_the tikka_masala as_spicy as_they make_it
it_was_spicy but
i_wanted tears and_didn't get_any
it_was_still delicious
it's the_best_indian_food_i've_had in_las_vegas during_the years i've_lived here
great_service
great_atmosphere
and_great_food
go
this_is_the nd best_indian_food ever
we've been_to_the middle east and_had true indian_food_and experienced the_full cultural effect
anyhow
we live_in orange county
ca
and eat_here every_time_we come_to vegas
which_is pretty often
we've tried numerous places close_to_home and have_found nothing that_comes even close to_india_palace
we_always leaving enjoying the_food of_other establishments since_we love_indian_food but_it always feels_like something is lacking
we always_get_the same items
papadum served_with various sauces you_get this for_free right when you_sit down
garlic_naan
chicken_tikka it's_all white_meat with_onions and_peppers
chicken_vindaloo extra
indian
spicy
peas pulao
simple
easy and delish
the_place_is_clean and_the_service_is warm_and_friendly without being overbearing
my_friend_and_i called ahead to_see_if they_had_a lunch_buffet on_sunday
the person_who answered the_phone was_prompt_and courteous
he confirmed that_they_had a_sunday buffet_for
i_asked_if there_were any vegetarian_dishes
he said yes
and_then rattled off a_half a_dozen of_them off the_top_of his head
great
we're on our_way
this_place_is located just off of_the_strip don't walk it_though
it_seems_to cater_to locals and adventurous tourists and california visitors looking_for_good indian_food
like_me
the_area is_a_little run down
definitely_not the pride of vegas
buffets_are common in_this town
even_in off strip restaurants
where even all_you_can_eat sushi is_the norm
india_palace has_been completely remodeled inside_and out since_i_was last there a_few_years ago
i_think_that even_the assphalt parking_lot was new
the_new space is_awesome inside
it's very_nice_and well appointed
trendy
somewhat techno indian_music adds to_a well designed layout with dark wood tables
cozy booths
and_a_nice central bar area
the_lunch_buffet_was great
lots_of veggie stuff to_choose_from
little to no vegan though hard_to find with indian_food_since ghee and cream are staples
they_also must_be paying attention_to some yelpers since the_service_was_great
the_service_was fast_and friendly_and hot_naan hit our_table about_as fast as it_takes to cook_it
and
yes
you_can get_the matriarch to smile when_you smile at her and compliment her naan
which_was fantastic
we'll definitely be_back
nice_decor and very_clean
the_servers need_to take some training on etiquette
but they_didn't mean bad
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was tasty for_sure but a_small portion for_the money
goat biryami was_bad
gulab jun was_yummy
let me start by saying
this_was_my_first_time having_indian_food
i_was_a_little worried because_i'm not_too sure i_like curry
didn't_think i_would_like indian_food
but_my mother in law wanted_to do the_lunch_buffet_for her birthday
she and her husband spent a_year and a_half in_india
wow
with the_exception of_some chick_pea salad thing
i_liked everything on_the_buffet
and_i basically tried everyting
the chicken_tikka_marsala or
butter_chicken
was_so yum
my_mom in law called around trying to_find_a lunch_buffet_with this_dish and_only india_palace had_it
so score
i_also really_liked_the spinach
not_sure what_was in_it
but it_had_a spicy kick
there_were also these vegetable fritter things which_were great
sorry
i_can't be_more descriptive
but_i_was overwhelmed
the_service_was_great
i_believe the_owner_was waiting on_us and_he talked to_the in laws about india and_really made_it a_good_experience
cute decor
parking_is tight
overall
i would_definitely_recommend_this_place
this_review_is_for their_lunch_buffet
i_was_so lucky today
the_buffet_had my_favorite entree and_dessert
all for_about
which normally would_have cost me close_to easily
goat karahi
the_meat_was so_tender and_flavorful
place a_piece_of this delicate meat on_a piece_of_naan
add some white onions_and a squeeze of lemon
what_do you_get
yummy yummy in_my tummy
kheer
traditional rice_pudding made with_basmati_rice
milk
sugar saffron
i can_eat bowls_of this easily
so_delicious
they constantly bring_out naan to_you when your basket gets low
aside from these awesome things_that i_eat from the_buffet_line
they_also offer other_dishes like the_pakora
aloo_gobi
chicken_tandoori
and many other_dishes and_desserts
my_friend_had mango_custard and_she said it_was_very_good
i vowed to_try_it next_time by not overstuffing myself with the_kheer
their_menu changes though
the_other time that_i_was here
instead_of the_goat karahi
they_had lamb_vindaloo
instead_of kheer
they_had gulab_jamun
milk cheese balls soaked in_a honey syrup
which_was_a sad day for_me
i expressed to the_server with_a pout
indicating that_i_would much prefer the_kheer
next thing you_know
he brought_out_a serving_of kheer just for_me
yay to_the awesome server
therefore
if there_are certain items_that you_like
you_might want_to call ahead to_check_out what's on_their line
other_than_that
if you_feel adventurous
please check_this_place out
i_will_definitely come_back
went_for_the_lunch_buffet and_came away very_pleased
with the_exception of_the crazy lady seated behind us rambling and talking about weird
crazy shit
the food_was_fresh
tasty_and we_enjoyed many_of_the different_dishes we_tried
it's_been a_long day_and i_can't_remember exactly what_we_had by name but we'll definitely be_going back
the_tikka_masala_was great
yum
yum
and yum
the_garlic_naan is_to_die_for
i had_the_chicken_tikka_masala and_it_was absolutely_delicious
last sunday i_took_a friend from oregon to_india_palace
i've been_there many_times and_each_time is_as_good or better_than_the last
the renovations make_it quite lovely inside used_to_be pretty drab
we_had_the buffet and_i_had honestly forgotten how_much it cost so was_pretty surprised to_get_the bill
under for_two
the rogan_josh is out_of_this_world
but_everything on_the_buffet is_delicious
the_flavors_are wonderfully blended and_some_of_the dishes_are moderately spicy_but_not hot hot
the_naan_is included which
as you_may know
can add quite_a_bit to the_cost of your_meal if_you_order from_the_menu
i've_been_to several other_indian_restaurants_in las_vegas_and india_palace has_never disappointed
my_friend was suitably impressed and_is looking_forward_to going_there again on her next_visit
and am_i being anti pc to_say_that we_were_the_only non indians in_the_restaurant that afternoon
that speaks well of_the_place
oh_and if_you_have an entertainment book
there_is_a coupon although it's_not good for_the_buffet
but_at
who needs a_coupon
india_palace has_been voted best indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas by_the zagat survey every year since and it_has_been described to_me by indians as the_most_authentic restaurant we_have
i've dined there a_handful_of times to_see_if i_agree
although_i wouldn't normally want_to hang out_on east twain
one_of_the city's most dangerous areas
i will_always take unnecessary risks for good_food
the_restaurant sticks out_as the_only kept up
interesting piece_of architecture in_that area
so it's_hard_to miss
you_will forget about_the exterior surroundings upon entering as the_decor_is immediately welcoming
the_walls are painted in warm
cheery earth tones that_are beautifully complemented by heavy amber drapes and_rich
dark woods
there_is_a comfortable full service bar you_can enjoy a_drink at before your_meal
making india_palace stand_out from many of_its competitors
my_favorite thing to_get here_is the_dosa
a thin pancake made_from chickpeas
it_is of such great diameter that_it must_be folded upon itself so it_can almost fit on your_plate
and_it_is eaten by tearing off more reasonably sized pieces
the_only_other place i've seen dosa_is at india_masala in_the_riviera
same owners
i_believe
so i_highly_recommend ordering it_here
you_can_have your dosa stuffed_with an incendiary potato filling
or get the_plain papper dosa
which_i prefer
both
it_is served_with an addictive coconut 'chutney
' which_is more_like_a coconut puree
and sambar
a tangy tamarind based soup dip
even without_the accompaniments
the_dosa serves as_a fantastic vehicle for eating your main selections and proves to_be an_interesting alternative_to naan
the_chicken_tikka_masala
and mushroom matar
are fantastic
but_i_think_the chef's abilities stand_out most in the_lamb_rogan_josh
the_tomato broth is reminiscent_of an_authentic
slow cooked italian marinara that has_been spiked with exotic spices
and the_flavors continuously evolve in_your_mouth
revealing the sauce's complexity
the_lamb is perfectly tender to boot
and hasn't a hint_of the gaminess that_can come_with lower quality cuts
so
is india_palace the_best_indian_restaurant_in town
i_can't affirmatively say yes
i_had_a spinach soup that_was inedible and they_don't use many fresh veggies in their_lunch_buffet
but_it is_definitely_a contender
finally after several years of going_to lunch_at another nearby indian_restaurant we_tried india_palace
what took_us so_long
yeah
the_neighborhood
i_would_be pleased if_they hired some armed soldiers with
enfield rifles to stand at_the doorway and_of_course in traditional_indian army garb
just kidding
but_that_is a part of_las_vegas that_isn't a_place_to walk through at_any time_of day
what really surprised us was_the immediate sense_of peace and luxury when_you stepped inside
what_the hec
are we in_the bellagio off east twain
felt like stepping into_a ford pinto and on_the_inside it's_a ferrari
although we've been dining on indian_fare for many years
we_still don't know_the proper names of_all_the different foods
yeah sag is spinach
naan_is the_bread and_so on
but_what we_do know is_that the_food_here at the_lunch_buffet_at india_palace_is probably_the_best we've ever_tried in so
nevada
the_flavors_were all_a step above_the competition
service_was attentive_and_friendly
the_buffet_line is_a_bit shorter in length than_the competition
but_the overall quality far exceeds quanity
naan_bread_is brought to_your_table fresh_and not_in cold piles in the_buffet_line
overall_a great_experience_and we_have_been converted
i'll even overlook the overly engergetic bollywood videos they play behind_the bar
oh yes
i_like samosas
but no_one seems_to have_it available very often
i_do miss those
since our last_visit approximately years_ago
the_restaurant_has undergone a_complete makeover so the_dining_room is quite_nice though_the immediate area surrounding the_restaurant remains depressed
we_did_not require our reservation as the_dining_room was_empty
shortly after being_seated we_were_served complimentary papadum and chutney sauces
we_decided_to share orders_of garlic_naan
chicken_tika_masala
basmati_rice_and lamb sagwala
the_flavor and spice_level_of each_dish proved to_be too tame for my_taste_buds
we_got_the rack of_lamb dinner without knowing that_it_was enough for_two_people
we also_ordered this masala_dosa or whatever you call it
a_huge crepe looking thing stuffed_with potatoes_and onions
the_lamb_was delicious
and_the_rest of_the_food_was just_ok
i_am curious about their_lunch_buffet probably_would go try_it sometime
but don't_think_i will_be_back_for dinner
i'd give_this more_of_a
it's las_vegas
so_i_guess you_should expect_to_pay las_vegas prices
i've_had dosas in california and_in asia
and_would give_this a_for flavor
that's why we_came to_this_restaurant for_the paper dosas
we_also_had_the malai_kofta
and_that_was better
naan_was solid and so_was_the basmati_rice
service_was_great
i've been all around_the_world eating_indian_food
especially
dosas
their dosas_are mediocre
they're supposed to_have_a crunch to_them
however
theirs came collapsed and slightly cold
the_malai_kofta we_ordered_was a_touch bland
now_the tragedy
they_charge for a_small bowel of_basmati_rice
i've never_heard_of ordering curry without_a serving_of rice
what_a rip off
so bottomline is that_you_get mediocre food_for_a terrible price
i_would_not go_back
went to_the_lunch_buffet
very_yummy
unfortunately they_didn't_have the_chana_masala
which_i heard was_very_good
so_i plan to_go_back_and_try that
i_had_a mango_lassi
it_was creamy_and delicious
complemented the_flavors_of the_food nicely
and_the_service_was super friendly_and_attentive
great decor too
our_favorite indian_food_in_las_vegas near the_strip_and unlv campus
sure
it's kind of in_a sketch area
but the_building is_nice_and once inside
the_decor_and food are_just great
they play bollywood movies or clips on_the tvs and_it's fun to_watch while_waiting for_our_food
tonight our_party of was_really hungry so_we_ordered our staples
vegetable_samosas
for
garlic_naan
basmati_rice
matar paneer
and dishes_we haven't_had before
house special lamb_rogan_josh
full tandoori_chicken
and chicken_vindaloo
we're wimps so everything_was
mild
spicy but_still very_flavorful_and delicious
with_plenty_of leftovers to_take_home
i_like_to try different_things on_the_menu each time we're here
but would_definitely order_the lamb_dish again fantastic flavor_and tender
i only_wish i_had room for_dessert when_i eat_here
i_always come_here with a_coupon to_make_the meal an even_better deal
ended up being person including tax
and_the_waiter always have_to_be reminded to_take_the discount
but i've_always had_good attentive_service and_great_food here and_that's why we keep_coming back
india_palace_is an_excellent alternative_to nearby buffets on_the_strip
and
generally speaking
far less expensive
for_about
you_get_a solid variety_of popular indian_dishes
chicken_tikka
tandoori
veggie_korma
dosas
basmati
naan
salad
and_desserts
to name a_few
which all taste pretty_good
i_have_had indian_food all_over_the world
so_that's a_definite compliment from_me
although_the place_was_pretty clean_and had decent decor
the_service leaves some room_for improvement
the_location_is also a_bit seedy
but understandable as_it_is on_the outskirts of_the_strip
i_also gagged when_i discovered something_that resembled a cockroach leg in_my masala
after inspection
i'd_like_to give india_palace the benefit of_the doubt even though i've never seen such_a thing in_the countless masala dishes i've_had
but nevertheless
it totally ruined my appetite
but_not enough_to not give india_palace a_second chance
the_lack_of service_and room_for improvement on_the curries
i_have_had better saagar in newport beach is_a comparable place_and is_much better
led me to_give out_of stars
great_food
being that_i'm indian_and have_had my fair share of_indian_food over_the years
the_staff_is_friendly enough
no_real quips there
they_did take a_while after dropping off the_check to_come_back_and pick_it up
but_nothing major
water was_filled constantly which_was_good
the one_star taken off was_for parking
there are_very few spots and_its kinda weird trying_to get_out as_you drive around back_and through_the trash area if you park on_the side
but_nothing major
still worth checking_out
we bought a_groupon to_india_palace and_decided_to use_it last_night
we_ordered goat briyani
malai_kofta
garlic_naan
and_mango_lassi
the_meal started_with_the typical papadum and_chutneys
the_tamarind_chutney was pretty_decent
i'm not_a_big_fan_of tamarind
but_this_was better_than_the tamarind chutneys i've tried elsewhere
the_mint_chutney was_also pretty_good
they_also_had a pepper chutney which had_a_nice kick
my_wife thought the_mango_lassi_was almost as great_as at her favorite_indian_restaurant
the_garlic_naan_was good
not_too burnt or chewy which i've_found to_be_the case at many_indian_restaurants
the_goat briyani was_really_good
it had_a_nice mix_of flavors_and textures
my_wife really liked_it until i_told her it_was goat
she doesn't like goat and i_ordered_it while she wasn't listening
the briyani came_with raita which_was decent
the_malai_kofta was_also enjoyable
the_sauce_was very_flavorful_and the
vegetable meatballs
had_a_nice texture
the_service_was_pretty slow
but_overall it was_a_good_experience
and i_think_i'll probably be_back
really good_lunch_buffet
they_had all my_favorites
and_were careful about keeping the_vegetarian stuff and_meat stuff separate
the_ambiance here is_very_nice
the_only_reason i_am_giving four and_not five_stars is the_location
it seemed_very scary
even in_the_middle_of_the afternoon
i_would_not come_here at_night
especially not by myself
it's a_shame such_a nice_place is_in such_a shady neighborhood
i've tried_a_few indian_places during various trips_to vegas
and_i_must_say this_was_the_best food for_sure
the people_working here_are also very_nice
overall this was_a_good_experience and i_suggest trying this_restaurant
every_indian in_las_vegas eats here
if_you're_not indian and_you want_to_eat where_the indians eat
this_is it
it's_the bomb
and_i_don't mean bay
everyplace else_is like_the toilet that kid hid in in_the movie slumdog compared_to this
great_service
and delicious_food
always seems_to be plenty of staff on hand and_your glass hardly ever gets below half_full
the_neighborhood isn't the_best
but india_palace_is worth_going out_of your way for
my_favorite_indian_place in_town
we_visited on_a random reco in january and were_a_bit sketchy because_of_the neighborhood
you_have_to call a_cab for pickup
but_we live_in la where usually the_best restaurants_are in_a weird strip_mall
the_wait_staff_was terrific in recommending a_bunch_of options
we_are vegetarians so_we just asked_what the_house specialties were and_had_a fantastic set of different_dishes
we_did hear another couple raving about some_of_the meat_options so_i bet those are stellar as_well
prices_were very_reasonable and_it_was only a_cab ride from city center
the_staff_was_very_friendly and we're going back the_next_time we're in_vegas
i_stopped today to_try_the_lunch_buffet
what_a_great idea it_was and thanks_to my_fellow yelpers for_their reviews that helped me make my decision
the_restaurant_was almost empty when_i_arrived at
service_was_excellent_and i_know_it would_have_been even_if there_were a_lot_of_people there
while_i_was looking the_buffet over
the_waiter_brought me an iced_tea as requested
shortly after returning to_the_table
another server brought_me a_basket_of fresh_naan
here's what_i tried
vegetable_pakora good_but_not a_lot_of spice
goat_curry nice spice and_very_tasty
saag_paneer with cheese flavorful with_a_nice zing
basmati_rice standard
naan plain_and good
chana_masala excellent with_a_nice spiciness
bhindi_masala this_was noted as_a house favorite
i_didn't_think there_was anything special about the_okra nor the_potatoes and_it lacked much_flavor
navratan lorna good
karahi lamb nice flavor_and good spice
chicken_tikka_masala excellent
ras malai excellent sweet to_end this feast
lest you worry that_i cleaned the_place out
let me assure you i_didn't
i_took small_portions of_all these things just_to try_them
since_i_was alone
i_had a_great_time watching the_bollywood bang bang music_videos on_their tv screens
i'm anxious to_come_back for_a relaxed dinner with_friends and_enjoy being_served and trying some_things on the_evening menu_that don't show on_the_buffet
i_visit las_vegas about times a_year
and_am always looking_for unique restaurants
recently while_visiting
i happened_to ask my cab driver where_i might find_some good_indian_food
and_he directed me_to this quaint restaurant called india_palace
their address is_at east twain ave
in_las_vegas
it's_located just off_the_strip
east of_the wynn casino
the_host of the_restaurant_was surjit
he_was so pleasant
charming
and informative of_the different_dishes
each_dish was_a unique treat for_me
i_wanted_to share this information because not many tourist would_be aware_of this_restaurant since_it's not on_the_strip
this_was quite_a delightful experience for_me both in_the_food and with_the charming host
surjit
this_restaurant_is definitely worth_trying
went_here to support a friend's event and stayed for_dinner
the_staff_was_very customer oriented and_kept our glasses_of water full_and were checking_in on_a_regular_basis
i_tried_the bhel_puri chana chat which_is chick_peas
puffed rice
onions
and_potatoes tossed in_a tangy tamarind_sauce
this_was very_fresh
my_friend tried the_fish tikka which was_also_very_good
i_also_tried
dal_makhani pretty_good
malai_kofta yummy
bhindi_masala it_was_good but_very oily
naan both the_garlic and_plain_naan very_light and_good
gulab_jamun yummy
this_was very fluffy
not how gulab jamuns usually are_so this_was_a pleasant change
i_was_told that_the chilli_chicken was_good_too
i_would_go and check_this_place out again
have_been_here thrice
always for_their_lunch_buffet
the_price_is decent_and the_food_is_awesome
their_food_is not_too oily and they_bring really_fresh bread to_your_table
the_ambience and the_music is a_nice_touch too
the_mango pudding_is so freaking delicious it_takes you straight to heaven
very_nice indian_restaurant
the_food_is fairly priced_and amazing in_quality
best lamb_chops and_chicken_tikka_masala by far in_vegas
now this_place_has an_awesome buffet
i_was totally disappointed_with las_vegas indian resturants and_then made_it to this_one on the_last day_of our_trip
can't say_enough about_this_place
the_food_was_delicious
fresh
with enough variety_and each_dish was a_pleasure to_taste
the_decor was_nice_and indian_and even_the restrooms were clean
very_satisfied
highly_recommend
it_was_only okay to_me
i had_better_indian_food
customer service_was_very_good though
for las_vegas standards
this_is fantastic_indian dining establishment
the_food_is_fresh_and very_tasty
the_saag_paneer is subperb and the_price_is just_right for_the_lunch_buffet
and_no lunch would_be complete without a_bit_of bollywood in_the_background
the_food_was_very_good
and i_highly_recommend mixing and sharing some dishes_with those you_come with
however
i_must_say that our_server pressured us a_lot
and made_our eating experience very uncomfortable
for_that reason
i_don't_see myself returning for_another visit
i_love india_palace
it's located_in_a not_so prime location but_once_you enter the_restaurant
you forget what_the exterior is_like
the_atmosphere has_an elegant feel to_it but doesn't require a_person dining to_be dressed up
the_servers_are all friendly_and are_very_good at checking up_on their patrons
their food_is_delicious
i_have_tried their_chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_saag
lamb saagwala
goat_curry
lamb briyani
samosas
and_their naan_bread
garlic is_my_favorite
and they_were_all so awesomely delish
don't_forget to_order_a side a_mango_lassi cause theirs is_definitely one the_best in_the_valley
what an awesome_place
ricky was_awesome
owner was_fantastic
we_will_be_back for_sure
the_food_was_really_good
the_place_was clean and_the_staff was_very_attentive
i_couldn't leave sin city without an indian_dinner
there_are_no indian spots that_i'm aware_of in henderson but_the logistics of my_visit had_me spend the last_night a_few blocks east of_the_strip putting me_in close proximity to several spots
i_chose ip since_it_was the_closest and_with car rental already returned i_was walking it
plus of_my options it_had the_highest rating
i_had_the lamb_rogan_josh which the_menu describes as
kashmiri delicacy cooked_with intensely hot fragrant spices
which it_was but it_did_not compete well_with_the lrj i_had_in philly
i_did have_something called 'temrin sauce' with_the very thin wafer type cracker not naan but_if you've eaten_indian you_know_what my brain doesn't but_the temrin sauce_was a_treat t remember
the goin out the_door on ip is
i'm looking_for_a repeat of_my lrj experience in philly and_it could_be ip's is more_authentic and_i'm simply duh
there_was_a presence of_indian clientele so perhaps i_am more duh then ip is_in authenticity
when_i'm in these parts again i will_give ip a try_again
india_palace had catered a wedding at_my work a_month ago
seeing_the satisfaction of_the native diners drew me_to_try this_place_out
i_had originally wanted_to use my groupon
but_that offer cannot be combined with the_lunch_buffet
instead
i_opted_for my_sister to_try_some new_dishes and determine new favorites
no fear about_the unused groupon
next_time_i_will return_for dinner
although_i might_have failed with_my initial mission
the free_mango_lassi for my_first check_in made_up_for_it
the_yogurt drink was_a_nice balance_of tart and_sweet
really refreshing for_the muggy weather we_have_been experiencing
with_the fourth of july over
and done_with
my meat intake had thrown me_off balance
to offset the bbq
no cuisine is_better_than indian_for when you_feel_like dining on good vegetarian_friendly dishes
did_i choose to_stay completely meat free
no
i_could_not resist a_few pieces_of goat in_a curry_sauce
a_piece_of tandoori_chicken
and_some chicken_vindaloo
all_of these_dishes were_fantastic
nothing_was overly salty or sweet
instead they_had strong herbal or spice accents that did_not mask the_meat
the cilantro chutney only intensified the sensations within my_mouth
now for the_real reason why i_love_indian_food
the paag paneer_was addictive and_tasted wonderful with_the fresh garlic_naan
nice pieces_of cottage_cheese were found throughout_the creamy spinach mixture
the dhal curry was_also_a favorite
the complex spices_in this yellow lentil_soup is_great over_rice
or_just eaten straight
do_not forget_to help yourself to_some kheer
this creamy rice_pudding is thinner than_the kind you_will find_in mediterranean restaurants
but has slivers of almonds within
the_buffet_is open from
for_a reasonable
india_palace is_the_best_indian_restaurant to my_taste in_las_vegas
i have_been_going here_for_the past years_and have_not once felt the_food_to_be unsatisfactory and_only once have i_found one_of_the staff members to_be difficult
he hasn't been_there_for years
however
to understand the reasons why they are_the_best would_take me the_better part_of a_book
so with the_exception of a_few highlights
i_will encourage you to_experience this food_experience for_yourself altogether a_more satisfying experience than reading any review
first_off
since they_are_a ubiquitous and primary form_of indian_food consumption
i_have_to rave about their_lunch_buffet
at_about
india_palace will cost you_that extra dollar or_two over mint
which_is more nepalese
if i'm_not mistaken
mt
everest or india_oven
but not_even ghandi's excellent fare is close in_quality and_variety
every_day there_is_a pilaf
lentils
tandoori_chicken
a saag dish
a korma
a tikka
a masala
a_salad
both mango_custard and kheer
naan and_sauces
raita
tamarind
mint and_a_few others
for a_vegetarian
this_is_one_of_the_best buffets for_you
the break down always has at least vegetarian selections in_addition_to the_rice_and lentils most others are_not nearly as diverse
for_the carnivore
the_selection_is by no means meager at least chicken_dishes plus tandoor and_a lamb or goat dish
alone
the spread is_great
but
having eaten_here dozens of_times
i_have_to comment that_the clencher for_me is the_fact_that i_can't tell a difference in_quality between_the lunch food_and_the dinner food
this can't_be said
in_my_opinion
of others
secondly
i_find
despite_the opinions of others
the_dinner to_be reasonably_priced for_the_quality
if you consider that indian_restaurants_are usually priced well above other non european
ethnic cuisines
it_is easy_to think_of them as pricey
but_the complexity of_indian curries_and the_time to_cook makes them cheap if you compare them_to a steak
also
if you consider the consistent quality_of_the_food
india_palace is_worth_the extra buck you_might pay over bollywood or mint
additionally
i_find them to_be cheaper than tamba or origin
what can i_say
i'm a_huge_fan
went_here today for_the_first_time and_left happy
i'm_a relative newcomer to sin city and_am always satisfied when_i try_a_new eatery with_great results
i had_the_lunch_buffet and_everything_was fresh
tasty
and colourful without any nasty aftertaste
something i've experienced at_other ethnic places
my_favourite dishes included the_goat tikka_masala_and the_saag_paneer
the_chutney was_pretty_good too
especially on_top_of the_naan
for_about tax
one can_eat his or her fill of nicely spiced indian_food_that is heavy on flavour and light on_the grease
both vegetarians_and carnivores have plenty of_options with which to_fill their bellies
i plan_on coming back again soon to_try_the dinner_menu
with a_coupon from restaurant
com
off makes dinner_here affordable for_us every few_months
for_four people
we_order the_mixed curry dinner
and vegetarian_dinner
plus an_appetizer if we're still hungry
the_chicken_tikka_masala_is my_favorite by far
and_the_mango pudding is_a_great dessert
i_love_the mint_chutney
but sometimes it's_a_little too_salty
the_service_is_always pleasant
but often too attentive with five different waiters checking on_us
i_didn't_know they_offer_a lunch_buffet
so_i plan_on checking it_out soon
four people
table_service
two who really_know and love_indian_food_and two who love_this_place
though i_am unsure of_the breadth of knowledge on_the cuisine itself
service
the_service_was fantastic
vick really took care_of us_and
having waited on_my friends_for the_past four years
exuded a certain cameraderie that_really brought everyone together
he_made recommendations
made_sure we_wanted for nothing
and_kept the_meal moving forward without making us_feel rushed in_any way
food
the_food_was mostly good
not_great
but_good
tasty enough to_share amongst friends over a_couple bottles of_wine
and some_good conversation
the paneer_pakora
cheese squares made_of layers of cheese with_some thin herb veggie spread in between
then battered and fried
was_disappointing
maybe_the squares are_too big_and cool off too fast
it quickly becomes a hunk of room temperature fried_cheese
it_didn't make think_of indian_food_as much_as any_other fried_cheese product around_town
the chicken_pakora was_much like the_cheese
it_seemed_like any_other fried_chicken strip
the_flavors want_to_be there
but it's_just_not executed well enough
not_impressed
the_samosas_were really_tasty
the crusts were flaky and_the stuffing was generous and_flavorful
layered flavors
a_great kick of_spice
and_the textures were_good
a highlight
for_sure
the_sauces
mint
tamarind
and chili
were_fantastic
really
really flavorful_and fresh
we refilled our sauce dishes_at least twice
best part_of_the_meal
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was tasty
not_the_best in_town
but_tasty
we_ordered one medium and_one hot
the_hot was truly hot
pushing the_line of too_much
and therefore hiding some_of_the flavors
still
the_flavors_were good and_the_chicken_was tender
the_peas pulao
basmati_rice with_peas and cashews
was_pretty damn_good
actually
i tasted a_bite with_a_little of_everything and_really loved_the freshness
the combination_of flavors
great complement
the breads were_good
my companions had_to_try at least four kinds
i tasted a_few small bits here_and there and_found them good
again
not_great
but_good
worth_trying
cost value
the apps and bread are priced well
especially_for groups who want_to get a_few_things and_share
the_entrees
however
are overpriced for_what_we received
appetizer size at entree prices
the_tikka_masala_was tiny for_what they_charge and_the_rice_was a_la_carte
also a_bit_pricey for what_you_get
bad juju there
as your
entree
becomes a_dish but it's_just_not a_place
it_wasn't my dime
but_for a_group_of four is_a_bit excessive for_a_place like_this
even considering the_wine
overall
food
and value of same
made_me think_it_was a
edible
but i_have_had much better
but_the_service and atmosphere_was easily a
so
a_star
a_ok experience
i_would_go again with my_friends as they_have_a special affinity for_this_place
but_i'll also take them somewhere_else when_it's my turn to_choose
food_is_pretty good_but service_is not_good at_all
i went_for_lunch and_didn't order_the buffett the_staff acted all put_out by that
and_when_i tried to_order_a dessert off_the_menu they_said they'd check_and see_if they_had it
it_was_ok but nothing_special
stopped here for_a_quick to_go order_for lunch_on our_last day at vegas before driving to airport
got vegetable_biryani
and_that_was awesome
wish_we had known about_this_place earlier
would_have definitely tried_the_buffet and other_dishes
the dinning area looked good_and_the hosts were very_warm too
would surely visit whenever in_vegas the_next_time
i_love india_palace
best_indian place_to_eat in my_own humble opinion
but
i suggest_you to_try_their lunch_buffets before_you decide for_yourself
they_have goat_curry
which_is total awesomeness
their_garlic_naan bread_is the_best_i've_ever tasted in_my entire life
they_bring it_out all fresh too
the staffs are_super sweet
i_wouldn't eat dinner_there though
especially if_you_are_a girl
this restaurant_is_located at_a pretty shady area
if you_really want_to come at_night
you_should bring pepper spray and or_a taser with you
i_also wouldn't come_here if_you're_a vegetarian
the veggie_dishes taste_and look boring to_me
sorry
i focus on meat
parking sucks also
don't park there if they_have_a truck there_to restock their kitchen
being_the asian female driver i_am
i_couldn't back out_my car
so
a_waiter had_to do_it for_me
yes
i_know
very embarrassing
we r regulars here and_we enjoy_the_food as_always
delicious fish tandoori platter and_i_love the_dosa
we_always request for gary to_serve us because_he cater_to our needs
thanks gary for_being amazing_and awesome as_always
excellent with_a capital x
i've been fairly content with all_of_the indian_food_i've tried in_vegas
but somehow
india_palace managed_to blow me_away
i_came_in here_to finally use a_long standing groupon with kris j before he moved out_of_town
we_ordered saag_paneer
navratan korma
and chicken_makhani
if you_know me at_all
you_know that i_love my butter_chicken
ip's makhani failed to disappoint
it_was creamy
tender
and_oh so_delicious
i'm_so enamored by butter_chicken
i_feel_like i basically ignore every_other dish_that the culture has_to_offer
i'm glad_i had such_an ip connoisseur with_me
the_paneer and korma both kris's selections were outstanding
i'm_not quite sure what_it_is
but_there's something_about ip's food_that just ever so slightly sets them apart from the_crowd
the_one weird thing_about the visit
it_seemed_like we_had five different servers waiting on_us and they_all lined up behind_the scenes to_take their turn to_come over_and ask if_we_had everything we_needed
it's_not_a bad_thing
it_was_just comical
i_wish_i_had bought more groupons now
the_food_is_awesome and the_service_is_good
waiters were_very_friendly
i_am disappointed_in the_lunch prices
i_was_hoping for_a_quick lunch_with my_daughter for_less then bucks and_the two_times we_went spent near
parking_is also limited
i_never know_what_i will_get when_i_go to_india_palace
will the_rice be crunchy and_dry
will it take the_waiter minutes_to give_me my check after_my plates are cleared
will_i get stabbed
generally
the answer is_no
which makes_it one_of_the_better indian spots in_town
but
don't_get too excited
the_lunch_buffet_is the_only_reason to_come_here
dinner_is incredibly overpriced
for a_vegetarian platter is crazy
crazy
why spend for_one bland dish for_dinner when_you can_get the_lunch ayce selection_of bland dishes for_less_than
save your dinner pennies for_something better this_is_not_the best_indian you will_ever have
no matter_what the_review journal says
bright spots on_the_menu include lamb_korma
lamb_in a_creamy
coconuty sauce
aloo_gobi
sauteed potatoes_and cauliflower
and_saag_paneer
creamed spinach with homemade cheese
i_also_like their renovations
they've greatly improved the_atmosphere
sad spots include burned naan
rather bland food
small servings of_rice
with dinner entrees
and dirty looks from waiters when_ordering mixed pickles and chutney
i_have_no idea_what that's_all about either
i'd only recommend india_palace if you happen_to be driving along twain during lunchtime
interesting place
we brought a_restaurant
com_coupon and_there_were three of_us
service_was
interesting
while_i like attentive servers
this guy was_a_little_too attentive
it_was_almost like he_was another dinner guest
he_was always at our_table
we appreciated the suggestions he_gave us for_starters but it_felt a_little pushy and too_much like_an upsell
the shahi_paneer was_pretty_good
that's my standard order
some_kind_of paneer
the kulfi was_good
but not_as_good_as mint
i_may come_back but_there_are a_lot_of great indian_places much closer_to me
so_maybe not
over_priced and_the entrees_are served_in very small_portions
the_bf and_i_have_been trying all_the indian_lunch_buffets about town
the_buffet_was overall decent
the spread was_fairly good_with navarathan korma being_the definite star
it_was creamy and_flavorful with crunchy veggies
a close second was the_chicken_makhani as the_chicken_was moist
some_of_the_other offerings were_good
but other than_what_i mentioned
pretty standard
the_service_is really_friendly and very_attentive so major points for_that
didn't need to_ask_for refills and plates were cleared right away
we_were checked_on often
i_think_i prefer this over the_other much talked about namaste
but_it cannot beat mint for_me
my first_time_here
the_restaurant_itself_is big_and spacious but_their parking_lot sucks
so make sure you're_not driving a_big car
i'm good_at back up parking my truck but_it_was really difficult turning around anywhere in_this mini parking_lot
the_food_was_excellent
i_had_the chicken_tikka_masala_and my_bf had_the_tandoori fish
all sizzling
we also_got the_peas pulau rice which_is rice mixed_with peas
almonds and cashews
sounds weird you say
i_know but man is_it yummy
we_also_had different appetizers that_are like bread stuffed potato and_the_other is bread stuffed_with minced lamb
those smelled like yummy cheesy pizza when it_came_out
lol
the_potato one was_alright
i dig the_lamb one much_more
for_dessert we_got mango_custard and wow
it_was_good
pricing is somewhat expensive
all the_main_dishes are_about and up
my small bowl_of chicken_masala was
eeep
we_did order_a sandwich
that almost_like a greek gyro
for_the bf's brother in_the kids menu section and for_only it_was_a footlong
so its give and_take
some dishes_are expensive and_some aren't
but i_would_definitely come_back_here
this_place_was great
excellent_service
large_portions
great_prices on alcohol and_very_friendly
will_be_back
i've been coming_here_for the_last years_and i_have_yet_to have disappointing food_or service
i_agree the_service can border on being overly attentive at_times
everybody is_warm_and friendly_and eager_to have you as_a guest
i_can heartily recommend india_palace to both vegetarians_and carnivores alike
i've visited with_a_large group_of vegetarians and_there_were nothing but compliments
so now the_food
the_thing to_start_with
especially with_a_group is_the assorted naan_breads
my_favorites include keema which_is naan_with minced lamb
garlic_and poori which_is fried whole_wheat bread
the_naan rounds out_what seem_to some as small_portions
when_you have naan
your entree of_choice with_the aromatic basmati_rice you_have_a very_generous serving_of food
no matter_what you_order
i_recommend getting rice as a_nice complement to_the sauces_and curries
i'm_not_a vegetarian
but enjoy the_spices of_the channa
chickpeas
masala
the_goat saag in spinach_and herb is_delicious
the_meat is_so tender_and juicy it_can best most steaks
i_can_say_that about_the chicken_and_lamb as_well
to_top_it off
india_palace serves a_great_selection_of beers from_india including hayward
taj_mahal and king fisher
i_find taj_mahal the_most refreshing almost sweet tasting
and_it goes well if_you_like your_food spicy
bottom_line
very attentive_service
delicious variety
very_tender
very juicy meats_and indian_beer
you_can tell the_ingredients are high_quality and worth_the upscale price
summary
flavor probably one_of_my_favorite india restaurants_in_town
the_lamb is tender_and not overcooked like other_places
price portions the_prices_are on par with other_indian_restaurants but the_portions_are definitely a_lot smaller
locale the_restaurant_is located_in_a pretty bad neighborhood and the_parking_lot is dimly lit
decor though_it might_not look it_from the_outside
the inside_is quite_nice
lunch_buffet they_have_a lunch_buffet_for
which i_think_is a way_better deal
moreover
i_wouldn't want_to_be in_that neighborhood at_night anyway
ordered
chicken_tikka_masala creamy_and delicious
this curry is_a_must_try
lamb_rogan_josh the_lamb_was_tender
the_curry_was a_tomato base and wasn't_as thick as_other curries
garlic_naan your standard garlic_naan
fluffy_and soft
cheese_naan they added cheese to regular_naan
it kinda tasted like_a cheese pizza
but better
recommendations
i'd definitely_recommend_this_place
however
if_you_don't mind which meal
i'd say go_to the_lunch_buffet_for a wider selection and_a way_better deal
this_place_is solid
the_food_is_good and a_couple_of hose indian_beers will lay u away
the key to enjoyment is the_tandoori chicken_tika
as hot as_they will_do it
very_very_good
butter_chicken
very_good
nan
rockin
the_owner_is cool
and_this_place really hs great_food
get anything fish
lamb
fish
tandoori
it rocks
enjoy
i_have_been there times
each_time_i come away thinking i_should_have started_to eat_indian_food sooner
our_server_was vic
he was_very_helpful and_friendly
this_is_a place i_will come_back_to
i_think_the pricing is a_little_high
but_i always_come away satisfied_with my evening
well
on_a whim my_friends_and_i were_looking_for a_good_place to_eat_and someone suggested india_palace
having heard the good_reviews over_the years
we_decided to_give_it_a_try
i checked the_yelp app on my_phone and saw_that with 'check in' on the_app you_get free appetizer or cocktail with purchase
the_reviews were_also favorable so in we_went
we_arrived_at pm and_the_place_was seemingly in between shifts so_we_were sat promptly
i_noticed on signage that_there_were happy_hour specials until_pm so_i_asked the_hostess about_them
she replied
happy_hour
why_not
you_can get buy get_one free on appetizers
great
it_was_about the_same_as the_deal on the_app so_we_ordered
we_had veggie_and lamb samosas
very_nice as_well_as_a few other_items including garlic_naan_bread
chicken briyani
chicken mixed with_basmati_rice with_spices
cashews vegetables
and_chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori white chicken marinated_in yogurt spices
simmered in_a creamy tomato sauce
pretty standard stuff
we_even opted for_some traditional desserts and indian_beer
all in_all the_food_was_really_good and_tasty and_i_was very_satisfied and_full
service_was_a_bit off
but_i_think that may_have been due_to_the language barrier
and_sometimes the_server would_suggest an item
and_then bring something else
in_this case he offered a_couple_of different beers and_then brought something altogether different
it_wasn't a_huge deal as_the beers were_good_and of_us_were sharing so_they went fast
what_was strange was_when the_bill arrived
i_asked again about the_happy_hour specials
as the_bill had not_been adjusted
our_server_was no where_to be_found and_the_server presenting the_check had_no_idea what_i_was talking about
i got_up to_ask the_hostess that seated_us about_the specials
she_was the_one that_said
why_not
and_she acted as though she_didn't know_what_i was talking about
then reluctantly adjusted the_bill
the 'new' server brought over_the adjusted bill and_seemed pretty aggravated at me
possibly for asking about_the discount
i_don't_know but_it_was not_a happy presentation of the_new check
we_paid and_left
i_would_go again
possibly for_a_buffet situation
as_i wasn't completely satisfied with_the_service
but the_food_was_very_good
i_think at_least_one of_my_friends wouldn't return due_to_the service
we_weren't asking much but_the hasty and unhappy presentation of out adjusted bill kind of put us off a_bit
like_i said though
we liked_the_food
so who knows
you_should know_that india_palace_is on_a very sketchy part_of twain ave
it_is literally always surrounded by police cars and as_we pulled into the_parking_lot of_the_restaurant
no less than police cars with sirens blaring were pulling guys out_of_a car next door_and had them pinned to_the ground at gunpoint
i_mention it
because i_know_the neighborhood well
and_this has_to_be one_of_the less savory sections
i_just wouldn't want_a tourist to stop_in and_be surprised but commotions such_as an arrest at gunpoint in_a connecting parking_lot
happy eating
just awesome
this_is_my_favorite indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
i_have_tried many others
but india_palace has consistently the_best_food
the_new decor is_a_plus
too
favorite items include shrimp biryani
vegetable_samosas
dal makani
aloo_gobi
tandoori_chicken
and_garlic_naan
they_also have the_best tamarind_sauce
get_the rogan_josh
had_dinner_here with_a_couple_of close friends
i'm glad my buddy recommended this_spot because we_had quite an_indian feast
great food_and_great_service
i_go for_the_buffet and it's_always a_wide_selection of_food
love_the_chicken makhni and_the fresh hot_naan
lassi was_a lil on_the sweet side
pretty darn_good indian_food
service_can_be slow
the_buffet_is pretty_good as_well
it_has gotten really expensive over_the years all_things considered
the neighborhood_is a_little_bit strange too so make_sure_you lock your car doors
my_girlfriend_and i_ate_here tonight
we_had_a restaurants
com_coupon and needed to_spend to_get off
we_started out_with_a bread basket with cheese
garlic_and lamb naans
and_onion kulcha
the_lamb naan_was particularly tasty
but_all four were_fresh
hot and_flavorful
we then had_the vegetable_pakora
which_was like deep_fried vegetable fritters
they_were nice_and crispy
my_girlfriend
having_indian_food for_the_first_time
went_with_the safe choice_of the_chicken_tikka
just_about right spice wise for_her and_she enjoyed_the dish
i
however had_the_lamb pasanda
i_ordered_it with_a spice_level_of out_of
it_came_out perfect_for my spicy taste
it had_a_nice bite without overpowering the exotic flavorful blend_of_spices in_the_sauce
all in_all
we loved_the_food
the service_was_a_bit_slow
even though_there was_only_one other_table of_people when_we_got there
the_waiter also_tried to_change my_mind when_i made my_entree selection
which was_a_bit annoying
apparently he thought a_different dish would_have_been better suited to_me
the decorum was_very_nice
until you_got to the_tv hanging on_the_wall
it kind of ruined the_mood set by_the lighting and_the paintings
price wise we_got a_lot_of_food for
enough_to feed people
but we_will enjoy_the leftovers
i'd_definitely go_back
vegas has_a gazillion restaurants to_choose_from
so_the list_of places_that i_want_to visit is_quite extensive
i_definitely knew that wanted_to_go to a_place_that would_have more locals than tourists
after running through my_list and seeing_the great yelp_reviews
i_finally decided_on india_palace
wow
i was_not_disappointed
started the_meal off with_the vegetable_pakora and_the onion_bhaji
the onion_bhaji
which_are onions dipped in spicy batter and_then deep_fried
was_amazing
it_had the perfect_amount of spiciness to_start_with
and_when i_felt_like upping the_spice meter
i_just added a_little_of that_really hot dipping sauce
i_don't_know the_name_of that sauce
but you_know
the_one that burns your_mouth off
i_went_for my_usual chicken_vindaloo for my_main course
chicken_vindaloo is chicken cooked_in_a hot spicy_sauce with diced potatoes
and_of_course
you_can request the_level_of spiciness
i_went_for
hot
to_die_for
it_was sooo good
it_was_so spicy that i_started sweating while_eating it
yeah
that's some_good shit
i gobbled this down_with some_garlic_naan and cheese_naan
and was_quite full
i_didn't even_have room for_dessert
which_is usually required in_my_book
when_i checked_in
i unlocked a_yelp coupon code
which_they pleasantly honored
the_service_was absolutely awesome
nice
quick
and_always a_smile
will_be_going back
excellent indian_food_in_vegas
a much_more upscale place than most_of_the other_indian_restaurants
many are mall spots
naan
korma_and saag were_all excellent_and a_little_on_the spicy side
i_would_definitely_recommend_this place_if_you are_looking_for indian_food_in_vegas and_don't mind spending a_few dollars more_for better ambiance
the_saag_paneer is_fantastic
the spices_are perfectly blended
but_i_was bummed they sent the_appetizers
we_got takeout
in_a styrofoam container so everything_was soggy and not_that tasty
in spite of_the appetizer drawback the customer_service_is impeccable
i'll be_back_for sure
i met up_with my_indian friend here_for_the_lunch_buffet
if_you_get the tendori chicken while it's fresh it can't_be beat
they_have this deep_fried veggie ball that_when paired with_the chutnay is magicial
the_naan_is always_fresh and_amazing
the_only_problem is it's a_buffet and_most everything had_been sitting_out for_a_while
the_rice_was old
the_chicken marsala was_over salted
and_the_goat was_still chewy with_many splintered bones
kheer is_amazing
but_you needed_to asj for gulab
if_they have_it you_won't_be dissappointed
good_service
good atmosphere
average per entree
having returned from_a wk trip in northern india about a_month ago
i_was_disappointed with_the_food
mattar_paneer was_alright the_peas seemed to_be_the frozen kind
very_sweet
chicken_curry_was too_salty
goat rogan_josh was_good
rice_and_garlic_naan were_good
my_indian coworker recommended mint i_guess i'll_try that_one next
india_palace_is the_most_authentic indian_food_in_las_vegas
probably one_of the_best_in us
excellent_food quality
very_good service
friendly_staff
esp gary and many
they remember us each time we_visit
their catering is_very well_priced and_he sends lots_of food
not_to_mention very_tasty
their best creations are chicken_tikka_masala
malai_kofta
paneer_tikka and paneer_tikka_masala
downsides food is_on_the pricier side
buffet could_be more variety
its usually same stuff
i_prefer their ala_carte
this experience has virgin all_over it
the_first_time for real indian_food
the_first_time at_india_palace
i_can_say_that the it_was extremely pleasant
the_food_was_very_good
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
medium_spice
there_was no hint_of hot
but the_chicken_was smokey and_the_sauce was_delicious
my_husband_ordered the_lamb_rogan_josh
medium_spice
again
not hot
but delicious
we_ordered_the aloo_tikki
a_side_of peas pulao and_garlic_naan
we_left no crumbs behind
i_will add
the hotest food i_had that_night was_one_of_the three suaces that_came_with the flat_bread
the_atmosphere_was just_right for my_husband_and_i out_for date_night
they_had recently
within the_last two_years
renovated the_place and_it_was nice
the neighborhood_is in_an older part_of_town
but close enough_to the_strip
although_i have nothing to_compare this too
i_felt the need_to express our satisfaction and desire to_try_the cuisine again and_again
enjoyed service and_most_of the_items_on buffet
dosas and_left more to_be_desired
we_all enjoyed_the_food at_india_palace
it_was_the_best indian_food we ever_had
the_service_was_also great
my_girlfriend had_the_tandoori dinner and_i_had the_mixed curry dinner
both_had real wonderful flavors_and soaked everything up_with naan
we_had_a separate order_of raita
i_don't_think it_came_with our_dinner dishes
overall
we_had great_experience_and the_food_was_just wonderful
we_would visit_again when_we return_to vegas
the_food_is fantastic
the_staff_is attentive_and polite
we_had_the vegetable_samosa and_onion kulcha to_start
followed by chicken_tikka_masala
really_good
and_a mushroom dish_that i_cant remember_the_name_of but_we thought_it could've been a_little_more spicey hot for_our taste
but_was still_good
we_also_had rice_with peas_and nuts with_various spices
the_dips they_serve when you_sit down are tasty
one spicy hot pepper
one sweet
and_the_other a_mint
overall everything was_very_tasty
and they_didn't seem_to use too_much salt like_most restaurants do
it's_a_bit far_from where_we live but will_be worth_the_trip back
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
we finally_got a_chance_to try india_palace
and_it did_not_disappoint
for_appetizers we_had_the veggie_samosas and the_onion kulcha
the_samosas_were fantastic
the_onion kulcha very_good but i_would_probably try something else next_time
we_had chicken_tikka_masala_and matar mushroom for_entrees
both_were scrumptious
the_food_was on_the spicy side in_general
which we_love
funniest part_of_the evening was after we'd been munching on_the papadums with_various sauces
one_of_the sauces was_extremely spicy
and we_told the_waitress hostess we'd like to_have our_entrees just_as spicy
she looked_at us and_said
you're white
right
i_almost fell off my chair
apparently most caucasians don't request their_food spicy
all_the better for_us
everything_was reasonably_priced_and evocative of_the fantastic indian_restaurant we'd left behind when_we moved_here from new jersey
this_is_the_best_indian in_vegas
hands down
excellent
the_decor_is contemporary and_comfortable
a_bit_more ventilation and_more lighting would_be good
it's_hard_to read the_menu in_the dark
warning
you really_do come_out of_there smelling heavily scented with the_spices
but not_in_a good way
unless_you like wearing eau de la india afterwards
so
onto_the food
veggie_samosas
the skin was_a_bit thick
not puffy airy like i'm_used_to
sambar vada
the_fried lentil donut had_a_very thick texture
i've never this before
but_i would've enjoyed_it more if it_tasted less dense
the_sambar had_a_nice flavor
i_don't_think_i could've eaten the donut without_it
mom ordered_the_tandoori chicken dinner
the_chicken is less smoky and_had less tandoori seasoning than other_places
those_of you used_to smoky lots_of seasoning will_be disappointed
the white_meat was cooked_perfectly
but_the dark meat was_a_bit underdone near_the bones
the_dinner came_with saag_paneer
good
mixed veggies
spices didn't agree_with me
something with_a ginseng taste in_it i_don't_think they pulled the sinewy parts off_the snap peas
and soup
flavorless
the mango_custard never_came we_didn't bother to_ask because_we_were too full
i_ordered_the_chicken sagwala
well
for
you_would_expect to_get more_than just_a_few chunks_of_chicken
the bowl was_just slightly a_bit larger than_the side dish_of saag_paneer my_mom received with_her dinner
garlic_naan
good
overall
it_was_ok
i_would_go_back again to_try_the_buffet just to_see_if they_had_a dish_that could out do_the dinner i_had
tonight was the_second_time my_husband duncan and i_ate_here
it_was even better_than the_first_time
we_had_a_great deal off_of groupon that included entrees
glasses of_wine_and rice
we_ordered an_appetizer that i_cant remember_the_name_of but_had a_really_good cold yogurt_sauce
and_almost tasted like dessert
we_ordered_the okra and_chicken_curry both extra extra_spicy
i_said i_wanted_to breathe fire
lol
it_was_perfect
the_dinner actually got spicier as we_ate
we_also_had leftovers to_take_home
thank_you we_will_be_back
and_as_a side note especially_if_you use
groupon
people
be_sure_to tip generously
recently i_had_been here_with_my family
being a_south_indian we_were craving_for authentic south inidan food and_were delighted to_find_this place_in yelp
we_were and all_of_us relished the_food
service_was_great
kids especially
liked the_tandoori_chicken
if_it weren't for a_groupon offer
i_would_have kept on driving by this_restaurant
it's not_in_the greatest neighborhood
so_i never would_have gave_it_a second thought
however
i_am glad_we took a_chance and_we highly enjoyed our_meal tonight
we_ordered chicken_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
orders_of garlic_naan
and_plain_naan
both curries we flavored just_right
we_ordered medium
but could've have handled a_bit_more kick in_both curries
naans_were yummy as_well soft_and fluffy
garlic_naan just_had the_right_amount_of garlic
the_place_was quite busy tonight
however service_was not lacking
nicely_decorated interior as_well
i'd_recommend this_place_if_you were in_the_area_and are in_the_mood for_indian
lunch_buffet_is delicious
if samosas_were on the_line it_would_be stars
i_ordered food_from them_on line and_was shocked to find_that the_chicken_tikka_masala did_not include rice_and was
absolutely outrageous
delicious food_and_great company
i_was visiting_vegas for_a convention and was_craving_indian_food
i_saw on_yelp that_they_were doing a_special offer and dined here
totally_worth it
can't_wait_to come_back
i_have_been_to las_vegas so_many times_but had_never come across this_place until this past april
i_am_very happy i_did
the_restaurant_is clean
we_made it for_a weekend_buffet
there_were many vegetarian_options
just_the only_complaint i_would_have is_that_the pakoras_were not so_fresh_and the_dosa_was cold
but_that would_not stop me_from returning
i_found_the wait_staff to_be quite attentive_and_friendly
i_would_definitely return on_my next_trip
very_good vegetarian_options for_dinner_and great_service with easy access from_the_strip
nice wine_list if_you_don't mind buying a_bottle
if_you_don't drink it all_you_can take_it with
i've_had many_indian meals and the_indian palace_has great authentic_food
friendly_staff
and a_family atmosphere
we_will back for_sure
try_the chicken_korma_and or masala they_were both uniquely spiced_and ohhh sooo good
the_management seems_to know_the formula for_a_good dining_experience here_if you're looking_for_a decent priced
tasty indian_buffet
lunch_buffet
good_food particularly liked the_goat_curry and_lentils
the_naan_was_good too
the_desert section is missing those delicious popular indian sweet meats
but_their rice_pudding was_decent
they told_us their meats are halal
which_is_a huge plus for_us
our_experience
we_arrived_at
p
m
and_the_buffet would close at pm
but the_server was_friendly_and quick
they were_able_to refill a_few of_the_dishes for_us
shortly after
about six more_people came for_the_buffet so the_staff refilled more buffet_items
if you_come late
please check_out_the buffet first_and request your favorites to_be replenished
tip
i_used a check_in coupon from yelp_and promptly received a_delicious
cold mango_lassi
don't miss out
this_was_one_of_the_best indian_restaurants i_have even been_to
certainly the_best in_las_vegas
the_food_was_delicious
very_friendly hosts and nice_ambiance
price was_just_right too
glad we_found_this gem
highly_recommended
india_palace is_my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in vegas
my_favorite_dishes are the_chicken_tikka_masala_and the_chicken_makhani
the_cheese_naan and_garlic_naan are also_excellent
the_servers_are friendly_and_helpful with recommending dishes
especially our_favorite server garry
we use certificates from restuarant
com every_time_we go to_save money
great_food
such great ambiance and_i_am a_total india food foodie
if_you_are looking_for_a great place_to_eat indian_food_in_vegas
this_is your spot
because_it hits_the spot trust_me
you_will_be glad you ate_here
we frequent this_place for_the_lunch_buffet which_is one_of_the_better ones we've tried_in this city
which_is why they deserve a
the_only_downside is_that this was_the_first_time we've come_here_for dinner and_the_service_was_great at_first but ended up being really slow towards_the later part of_our_meal
we_waited minutes_for_our second order_of_naan
it's safe to_say we_will not return_for dinner but will_definitely come_back for_the_lunch_buffet
star_for free_mango_lassi thru yelp checkin
below average_food
uncleaned plates_and glasses
bad_service
no water was_given for_the_first round of buffet had_to_ask_for it
very unhappy not recommended
the_guy with specs at_the_bar has_a very_bad attitude
we_had_ordered chicken_tikka_masala
dal_makhani and_naan there
it_was simply yum
daal_was tooo good
the_lady of_the_place was_really_nice to_us
its definitely a_to_go place for_us on_our next_trip to_las_vegas
ah
the site of my_first indian_experience
i_remember it fondly
it_may have_been almost two years_ago but the_taste_of curry lingers long in_my soul
it_was_a rainy night_in october of and_i_had_a groupon half priced offer
so_i grabbed a_friend_and went
he_had tried_indian previously and knew to_order_the garlic_naan
delicious
he ordered tikka_masala
i ordered_chicken sagwala
both_were quite_good
i_ordered mine with medium_spice
it provided that_great warming sensation without being too_spicy
though_i did need some tums shortly after
the_meal started_with_the aforementioned naan_as well_as something i_can best describe as_indian chips and salsa
crispy little pieces_of flat_bread with_three different sauces
one was_very strong with the_red chili flavor
one_was heavy on the_mint
the_third i recall as_being sweeter and_almost fruity
all very_good
i_was_surprised at_how much_food i_received
i_was_very full afterwards
i_had_to walk around_the boulevard mall for_a_while before continuing on_the my_next stop
see my review_for hofbrauhaus
after_eating at_india_palace
i_knew_i was hooked
the_flavors_are intense but balanced so_well
i drive_by some times when_in the_university neighborhood and_i_am always tempted to stop_in
i_am usually short on time_and cash though
in_any case
the_food_was_great when_i_went
the_service_was okay
the_restaurant_was clean_and comfortable
a_good first_experience
we_were_in town_for an event and had_the_chicken_tikka_masala
the_samosas
the orange drink with yogurt
the_garlic_naan_and the_fried fish
loved_it all
mostly like that_it_was romantically lit
and_the_service_was ok
i_love trying different_things
having previously lived for yrs in s california i've learned not_to judge_a restaurant by_its neighborhood
this certainly applies with india_palace
as its twain maryland neighborhood leaves everything to_be_desired
yet this excellant little_place has had_me returning over over_for yrs
seems_like they've never changed their chefs
as_the top_notch food_quality and_its uniqueness has not wavered at_all
service
cleanliness and pleasantness of staff also should be praised
i_wasn't super impressed_with_the india_palace buffet
they had_a_few interesting selections that i_don't usually see at indian_buffets
like malai_kofta yum
and_also a_few_things that_just looked downright unappetizing
the haleem looked really
really unappetizing and_my_husband confirmed my suspicions when_he
braver than_i
gave_it_a try it_was gross
the chutneys_were weird and_it_was hard_to track down a_server when we_needed a_drink refill or_something
the_malai_kofta was_tasty
though
as_well_as_a chicken_dish i_sampled and i_liked_the inclusion of samosas on_the_buffet
but the_gulab_jamun tasted like soap and chemicals and overall_i just_got a_weird vibe
we won't be_back
having just moved_to vegas_and missing my_favourite indian_restaurant back_home
we_gave india_palace a_try
using a restaurants
com_coupon
we started_with appetizer plate appetizers of your_choice
i_had_a lichi martini and my_hubby ordered the_beer recommended_by our_waiter
everything was_awesome
we then ordered lamb_rogan_josh and goat_curry
basmati_rice_and garlic_naan
it_was_all sooooo good
very_fresh
very flavourful
nice
clean restaurant
with lovely atmosphere_and wonderful wait_staff
waiter then directed us_to yelp for the_coupon here
can't_wait for my_next craving
restaurant was_nice looking inside for a_small_place
service_was slow and_it_wasn't so busy
food_was_ok
maybe indian_food_is just_not our thing
the_mango_lassi drink was_delicious at least
i have_been_going to_india_palace for the_last years
the team at_india_palace even catered our wedding
the_food_is_outstanding and i_have_eaten_at a_lot_of places_in_town
the_chicken_tikka_masala_is the_house dish_that is_the_best
they_have put a_lot_of money into the_restaurant and_it_is way better_than what_it_was a_few_years ago
if_you_have not had_indian_food_before then go_during lunch_and try_and buffet
you_can get a_little_bit_of_everything
it_was_ok
i_wouldn't go_to_the place_again though
food_was_awesome
but_this_place is_kind_of expensive
for a_vegetarian dish
we_ended_up paying for_three vegetarian_dishes
garlic_naan_and a_side_of_rice
plus a mojito and_a mango_lassie
i_will_say that_their mango_lassie is_a killer
loved_it
but
in_order not to_pay so_much
take advantage_of yelp's deal
for
we've used it and_the_price came out reasonable
india_palace hit_the_spot right on_the head
we_had_the chicken_vindaloo
garlic_naan
and lamb_tikka massala
they'll ask you_for the_spiciness level and_on scale_of
we_got_a and it_really wasn't that_bad
add on_the house sauces and_we_were stuffed_and satiated
the_only_problem here_was using the yelp_deal
for
perhaps it_came at_a point_of confusion for the_manager_and waiters but it_took a_little_bit for the_deal to_be honored
in_the_end
it_was_all fine
just be_careful to_have your voucher information and yelp_deal marked as redeemed to show them as proof
the service_and_food could_not have_been_better
i_love to_eat
so_i_know
hands_down_the_best_indian food_in_las_vegas
total flavor
authentic
full_bar
loved_it
am_going back
having lived_in both southern and northern california
i_found the_food_to_be good_but_not great
stars_because i_know how crappy the_other indian_food_in_vegas is
stars_because the_service_was not_very_good
and the_manager argued with_me about the_bill after_i claimed separate yelp offers
neither claimed they had_to_be used exclusively
and they_took the_order with_no issue when_i showed them_the offers i_was planning on using
the daals were the_best part_of_the_meal
india_palace_is our_favorite indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
the vegetable_pakoras and samosas_are delicious_and they_make the_best malai_kofta we have_ever_had
every_dish that we_have_eaten there
and we_have_eaten there a_lot
has_been delicious so_it makes_it hard_to choose just one_dish
and don't_forget the_garlic_naan amazing
we_went_here for_lunch last weekend during_our vegas trip and what_a let down this_place_has been
when_we_walked_in there_was no_one there_to direct us to_the_buffet or a_table so_we_decided_to just stand in_line and_pick up our_food after which we_had_to search for_a_table and sit ourselves down
we flagged a_server and_asked_for water which_came almost at_the_end_of our_meal
the_food did_not_have any flavor at_all and we_felt that_we_were just stuffing our stomachs rather than enjoying a_meal
the_masala_dosa was uncooked
tandoori_chicken bland_and i_cannot even define the_taste_of_the butter_chicken
finally we_decided that_you cant go_wrong with dal rice but_that again was under seasoned_and tasteless
the_sweet dish mentioned a mangao custard but it_felt like thick mango nectar that_was sweetened to_the_point of_being inedible
when the_host was informed by one_of_our group members that_the_food could have_been_better he_was arrogantly told_that the_food_is purposefully kept bland to suite the_taste requirements here
well it_is_not about the_spiciness_of food_but the_taste that_was non existent so_we just decided_to laugh and walk_away
tried_the_lunch_buffet this_time and_i_was meh
okay
no much food_selection but_i_did get_to_try a_few new_things that i_liked
service sucks of_course and_there_is one waiter that i_just do_not like because_of his personality i_guess
just seems_like he doesn't give_a shit but_it's probably like going_to a chinese place_and the_waitress being mean because that's_just their personality
he wasn't mean or_anything
just seemed_like he wasn't interested in helping or that_i_was annoying him
i_walked down here form the lvcc after_a_long day on_the consumer electronics show floor
and was_pleasantly_surprised
the_naan_was tasty
the navratan korma a_little different_than what i'm_used_to
but_still quite yummy and_the_staff_was attentive
wait
no
the_staff_was attentive until i_tried_to pay my_bill
that bit was sort of weird
they_were there just_enough to perfectly take_care of_me but_not be over bearing
until i_tried to_give_them money
one pint off for_the long time i_had_to_try to_flag someone down to_give_them my debit card
i'd_definitely visit_again but next_time
may just pile some cash on_the_table and wander out un noticed when_i'm done
the_chicken_tikka_masala
and_well
everything else here tastes amazing
however
i_am severely allergic to cashews
and_i told our_server this
he said they_could make the_masala for_me without cashews
but they_forgot or_something
so_i_had a_pretty bad allergic reaction at_the_table that left_me sick for two_days
i_haven't_been back since because_i'm scared
but if_you_like curry
and aren't allergic to cashews
you_should definitely check_this_place out
the_first two bites of_that tikka_masala were
almost
to_die_for
great please
the food_is_really_good
delicious
i've never been a_big_fan_of indian_cuisine
but_my meal_here was_excellent
i_had_the lamb_rogan_josh with the_peas pulao rice and_a_side_of garlic_naan
everything_was fresh_and_delicious
the_lamb_rogan_josh in particular was very_well balanced with_the seasoning and the_lamb_was_tender
one word_of caution
the surrounding neighborhood is_a_little sketchy so be_careful walking there at_night
the_food_is really_good_and authentic
always consistant
if_you_don't_like your_food too_spicy i_would_recommend less_than_a on_the scale_of
i_asked_for a and_the_food_was hot
they_have_a loyal following in_las_vegas
i_believe it's_one_of the_best_places for_indian in_las_vegas
my_other favorite in_las_vegas is ghadhi
pros
chicken_korma mildly spiced chicken in_a cream_sauce with cashews
almonds raisins
baingan bharta tandoor baked eggplant saut ed with herbs spices
rack of_lamb baby lamb_chops marinated_in yogurt spices cooked_in tandoor
cons
portions_are small
great_place
diamond in_the ruff
india_palace just doesn't stack up_to_the other lunch_buffets in_town
the decor_is_nice
misti mentioned mtv india on the_tv
which_is really cool
the_buffet selection can_be more interesting than our perennial favorite
mint
and_having samosa on_the_buffet is_always nice
but_the_service_was sketchy and the_flavors felt diluted compared_to mint or mt
everest
i_would really_love to_find_a truly great indian_lunch_buffet in_town but_this just isn't it
food_was_ok
never expect amazing_food from any_of_the india palaces and taj mahals
there_was_a private party going_on and the_kids were running around
yelling and misbehaving
the_restaurant should_have closed admission to general public or have_asked the private party for courtesy
service_was_good
food was_mediocre
we_went because this_was_the closest place and_everything else had waiting
rightfully so
we_always come_in here_for their_buffet
good_food_and costumer service
this_is_a fairly small_restaurant but_the decor_is_nice and the_service_is_friendly
their_chicken_tikka massala is_very_good
with_a_great tandoori flavor on_the chunks_of_chicken
they have_a_lot_of traditional items_on_the_menu as_well
not_just westernized dishes
when_i get a_craving_for_indian
this_is_the_place i_go
awesome_indian food_and_service
no_one loves indian_food more_than me
it's my chill grub when i_want_to just veg out and_enjoy a_good movie
the folks here_at ip know_how_to do_it best
i_had placed my_order over the_phone not knowing what_to_expect flavor wise but following my motto of
try something new every_day
once_i entered inside the_restaurant_was jam packed which_i took as_a sign_of great_food
ricky greeted me
took down_my name
asked_if_i had ever_been there_before and_made me_feel welcome
although_i was_just ordering a_variety_of my_fav appetizers he asked_if_i was using any_of_the discounts offered thru the_app
i suggested that i'd save those for a_larger order and_he mentioned if_i do use_it in_the_future to_ask_for him for_any additional discounts that_can_be offered
also
ricky reminded me_of my
free_mango_lassi with check_in
he_was_very prompt with_their yelp offerings and_i appreciate that
after_all that's how_i found them
quality_and flavors_of_the food are easily stars in_my_book
and i_wouldn't hesitate_to return in_the_future
the_only_downside is_that_the parking_lot is_small_and there_were a_ton_of taxi cabs picking_up dropping off
space is_limited but_once_you taste the_food you'll understand why
hole in_the_wall
establishments always turn out_to_be the_very best
try_it today
it_was_a_great time being at_india_palace
i_love the_food_and_service both
particular
gary is_the guy_who provide us excellent_service whenever_i been_here with my_friends
he always recommend us few_things and_we enjoy 'em all
thank_you very_much gary
we truly like_your service
i_strongly recommend to_visit this_place_if_you fond of_indian_food
great_food
courteous staff
good_service
i_had_the_chicken masala dish
very_flavorful
don't_be afraid to_ask_for spicy
i'd say the_food_was_very_good and the_service_was_excellent
they_had two yelp deals going and we_were_able_to use both of_them with_no problem
the_chicken_masala was_very_good
though a_little_on_the salty side
and_the_chicken sagwala was_also_good but_could have_used a_little_more flavor
the_mango_lassi and paratha were_both top_notch
that_said
neither of_us_were disappointed and i'd_definitely come_back_here
this is_my_first foray into indian_cooking here in_las_vegas
so i_have_to_say im very_impressed_with the scope of_the_menu as with_the freshness and_flavors of_the_dishes
service_was alright
not particularly friendly_but efficient none the_less though there_was_an older woman bringing out the_dishes
she_was amazing
i_think she may_have been one_of_the_owners
just amazingly warm_and_friendly
wish she_was our_server the_whole time
the tvs and sound system were playing bollywood music_videos which_was pretty fun
they_do_have a_full_bar
oh_and be_sure_to check_in
we_got_a free_mango_lassi
on_to the_dishes
chicken_tikka moist
fragrant
flavorful and_oh so_tender
chicken_tikka_masala big bold flavors
creamy_and again insanely tender
malai_kofta similar_to the_chicken_masala though not_as spicy
balls of cheese and_vegetable sitting_in a thick creamy gravy
garlic_naan lightly crisp with_a_nice chew this complimented our_dishes with_the ability_to scoop up_the amazing sauces
basmati_rice another amazing vehicle for_the more gravy laden dishes
we'll be_back
i_had_been craving_indian_food for_a_while now so_i forced my man to_come with_me
unfortunately
he_is not_a_huge_fan of_indian_cuisine
we_got here_at
on a_sunday_night and_there_was just other_table besides us
this_place_is located_in_a pretty sketchy neighborhood but_once inside it's_not that_bad
we_ordered
the_tandoori_chicken dinner special
tandoori_chicken
saag_paneer
mixed_vegetables
the_mixed curry dinner special
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken sagwala
chicken_masala
dinner specials also come_with dal soup
traditional veggie soup with delicately spiced lentils
and choice_of bread
we_got garlic_naan roti
they_also give_you complimentary pappadum chutneys
mango_lassi
free with check_in but they_only let us have to_share lol
tasted like_a sour mango yogurt milkshake lol
the_food_was_just ok
my_favorite item_was the_chicken_tikka_masala the_service absolutely sucked
even though there_were servers just sitting around no_one even came to_refill our_water_glasses or check up_on us even once
anyways after we_left i_started feeling sick and when_we_arrived home i most definitely was sick
ewww i_got food poisoning from there_and spent the_next_day feeling absolutely miserable
the_total bill_was over_and the_food_quality was the_same
if_not worse than_a standard lunch_buffet
thank the lord i_had_a restaurant
com certificate so_we only paid a_little over
but_it_was not_worth getting sick for
i_will stick_to mount_everest or try mint next_time
blehhhhhhhh
hot tip
indian_lunch_buffets are absolutely the_way_to_go
food_is_good_and service_is really_awesome specially garry
he rocks
we_will_be_back
i definitely_have issues doing dinner_at an_indian_restaurant_that does a_lunch_buffet
it_doesn't make total sense but_i usually prefer origin india just for_that reason
but_it_was late
we_had_the craving and my_wife_had a_great_experience
lunch_buffet
the_last_time she_was here so_we gave_it_a go
the_place_was still full_of people at pm so that_was_a plus
i_was_excited_to see dosa on_the_menu but the_waiter told_me their grill wasn't on and_it would_take at least minutes_to_get ready
ok
nevermind
there's_a free_mango_lassi with_a yelp_check_in
he tells us it's only good for_one lassi per table
fine
we unintentionally went vegetarian for the_evening
my_wife always gets the_saag_paneer extra_spicy and_i went_with_the matar paneer
both_dishes were_very_good
the_peas in_my matar paneer were_super sweet
maybe_the sweetest pea i've ever_had
i devoured them
the_naan was_pretty_good but the_aloo paratha wasn't worth_the extra
i'll be_back_to_try the_lunch_buffet but_i_think i_am done_with dinner_here
use_the yelp_deal
the_food_was_good
the_tables were_nice
no better or worse than other_indian_places i_suppose
the_guy with_the paint brush mustache was fun to_look_at
the_server with_the shaved head i_felt got a_little_too familiar_with us but_it_wasn't too_bad
i_have_been eating at_india_palace for_years and i_have_not been_disappointed
after trying a_few_other indian_restaurants_in_town i_have returned here every_time
the_staff is_very_friendly_and knowledgeable and_all_of the_items i_have_tried have_been delicious
their_lunch_buffet_is very_reasonably_priced and a_great_way for_people who aren't quite comfortable navigating the_full menu
the uncomfortable feeling you experience when pulling up_to this_location will quickly subside once you_get inside
the_building itself_is much nicer than it_was when_i started going five years_ago
bottom_line
i_have_not been_to or heard_of a_better indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
this_is_my best_indian_food spot whenever_i come_to vegas
beautiful decor
good_value
delicious flavored
i_have_tried other_indian_restaurants in_the_area
but_this_one stands out
specially tandoori_chicken wings
thumbs_up
i_have_to start by saying my_boyfriend is_indian and he_loved this_restaurant
he is_generally hesitant about dining out for_indian_food because nothing can compare_to his mamma's cooking this_restaurant was_as close_to_home as it_gets
we are_both vegetarians_and loved that_there_were plenty of_delicious options_for us
we_had veggie_samosas
vegetable_biryani
red daal
saag aloo
and baigan bartha
the bartha is rich_and smoky tasting
the daal_was creamy_and lucious
everything_was spicy_enough to_get_your taste_buds excited but_not so overwhelming as to_make_it painful
we_left with_plenty to_take_home and snack on for_the_next two_days
the_restaurant_is clean_and nicely_decorated
we_enjoyed the_bollywood music_videos playing around us
i knocked off one_star for service
i_dont expect good_service at_indian_restaurants and wasnt surprised with_a service that was_pretty much limited to throwing food_on_the table_and bringing the_check at_the_end
they_would also benefit from_a fulltime bartender while they_had_a full cocktail list i_was hesitant to order_from it doubting my waiter's ability_to make a_decent mojito
when_the craving_for a taste_of home returns we will_certainly be_back
best_place in_las_vegas_for indian_food
i_have_tried them_all
trust_me
love_this_place
amazing_food
fantastic atmosphere
our whole family loves it
especially_the mango_custard
good for_take_out
good ctm and kabobs
one_of_the_best_indian_restaurants anywhere
the_dal soup was_delicious perfectly spiced
hot
fresh_naan right from_the oven
lamb sagwal had tender chunks_of meat_in a spinach curry_sauce
equally tender
generous portion_of chicken_curry
and the_peas pulao could_not have_been_better
top_it off_with_a kingfisher beer_and go straight to heaven
great_food
great_service_and excellent location
we_ordered_the dinner special
it_is a_great_deal
get to_taste a_bunch_of items
they_have good beer_selection too
we_got_a mango_lassi on_the house
my_boyfriend_and_i came here_on_a groupon
and_after reviewing the_menu i_was_really_excited to_try_this_place
at_first
everything was_really_nice
when_we_were being_seated
the_host told_us a_party_of was coming in
and_that the_back room might be quieter
which it_was
the_back room has tables_and is_a_nice intimate setting
note
that in_the time_we_were_there
one tour bus full_of tourists came_in
ate
left
and_another bus full was coming in as_we_were leaving
the bus loads_of people appeared constant
and if_we_had sat in the_main dining_room
it_might have_been miserable
but anyway
everything we_ate tasted really_good
we_ordered_a goat dish
a_lamb_dish
and_samosas
the_veggie samosas_were kind of bland
and only_had potato in them
but tasted fine
when_we_ordered it_was_a_little weird that the_waiter asked_us what_kind_of rice_and_naan we_wanted
as_if it_came_with our_meal
when in_fact it_didn't
i've never_been_to an_indian_restaurant_that charged extra_for rice
so i_thought_that was_a_little shady
but_really none_of that mattered
because towards the_end_of our_meal
we_found a hair in our_food
a_short
curly
kind of hair
we showed the_manager
his response was
do you_want some_more rice
i_can_get you some free rice to_go
i'll take off_of your bill
mistakes happen
it probably came from_the_buffet
um
number one
we didn't_eat from_the_buffet
and number two
dude there_is_a pubic hair in our_food
while_i appreciate him taking a_little_bit off_of_the bill
what_i_would really prefer is for_him to_look disgusted
and go_back_to his kitchen and_have_a very serious talk with_his cooks about hygiene and cleanliness
but i_had_the distinct impression that_wasn't going_to happen
and he_just sort of acted like
oh these things happen sometimes
maybe he_didn't understand that_this hair did_not fall off_of someone's head
so
even_though_the food_tasted good
and up until that point we_had_been having a_nice time
i_really don't_think_i can_get past a pubic hair in_my food
we won't be_back
i've_eaten at most_indian_places in_town over_the years
this by far has_been the_best quality_and best tasting indian_food_in_vegas
the_atmosphere and service_is_great
they_have_a traditional menu_but the_only place_in_town that_has goat_curry which_is amazing
typical_indian restaurant
greasy_and oily food
taste was_okay
experience was_okay at_best
we_used the_yelp off coupon here the_owner firstly frowned after looking_at_the deal
promotion that_they_had been running
he honored the_deal but made_us_feel as_if he_was doing us a_favor
they_were catering a private party in_the_restaurant and_still kept it open_for general public
the party family kids created havoc
noise and jumped on_our tables
horrible service
they_never even cared to apologize for_the inconvenience
at least they didnt serve us from_the_buffet as_the party
which i_have_seen many cheap indian_restaurants do
there_are many_other good restaurants_in_vegas that_have great reviews_on_yelp
skip this_one if_you_can
alright so
i'm not_indian
i_don't_really know what
authentic
is
but
i_will_say this
i've_eaten at many_different indian_restaurants_in_vegas and california
and india_palace remains number to_me
this_place_is so
damn
good
also
just_to throw this out_there
i_work with_many indian_people
and they_really like_this_place a_lot as_well
take that information as you_will
but
i_think_it's a_good_thing
i've been_coming here_for_a very_long time and_i'm friendly with the_staff
they_are_so polite_and friendly
i_have always felt very welcomed here_since the_beginning
the_food
let's just talk about_the_food
it's amazing
my_favorite being of_course the_chicken mahkani
butter_chicken
it's easily one_of_my_favorite things to_eat
ever
they_bring you naan_bread to_the_table with_an option_of regular of_garlic
always go with_the_garlic
it's_not very overwhelming
i also_do the_buffet every_time_i come_here
i've_eaten here_for_dinner twice_and while_i really_do love_the_food
i_feel their_dinner portions_are rather small when compared_to the_price
one of_these times_i used_a groupon_and was_never met with any_kind_of negativity
so_it's weird to_me that people_are mentioning that
and_as far_as the_rest_of_the service
i've_never_had issues with being neglected service or having my_water filled
even_when they're busy_and hosting a_party
anyway
the buffet_is_great because you_get_a sampling_of a_lot_of different_things for_a low price which_is never a bad_thing
also
i give_it_a star_rating because as_much_as_i love_the_food
i_really hate driving here
it's_in_a not_so lovely part_of_town and the_parking here_is a nightmare when they're busy
try_it for_lunch sometime
of_course with a_mango_lassi
i_am_from atlanta which_is filled_with indian_restaurants
but_i never_go and eat_there as_they suck
i_visit vegas very often
and_i try to_eat_at this_place at least once when_i_am there
everything they_make is_just too good
i_love_their samosas kabobs naans
rather everything
they_make everything just the_way you_want it_to_be
yummy
yummy
i_ate soooo much
the_food_was_good
i bought_a yelp_deal
they_used_to let customers to_use_it for_lunch_buffet per_person
but_i called them and_the_guy said_no more
the_deal is_only for regular price items
i_wish_they can allow us to_use_it for_lunch_buffet again so_i_can group my_friends former coworkers to_eat_and have_some fun
i've_been_here twice for_lunch with co_workers now
and both_times have deeply enjoyed myself and_had_to waddle out
first thing's first
when you_go
order the_garlic_naan
it's wonderful hot crispy fluffy naan
slathered with minced garlic_and herbs
and_i_could probably just eat that and_the curry_sauce by_the bucketful
it's_not an_additional price on_top_of the_buffet
which_is_what takes india_palace from stars for_me
so garlicky and wonderful
the_buffet itself_is pretty typical_indian for mostly americans fare
i_had_the aloo_gobi
butter_chicken
a_few curries
goat_curry
and bahji
which_were all_good
and_i_had no_real complaints
some_of_the chunks_of_chicken were those hard fatty bits
and a_little_bit unpleasant
but those are_pretty expected in stews curries etc and_overall
everything_was_great
the_saag_paneer stuck out_as particularly delicious
they_were great about honoring the free_mango_lassi yelp_check_in deal
and
since_it_was my_first_time trying lassi
i_haven't_tried one before because_i'm not_usually a yogurt fan
and i_haven't wanted_to spend on a_drink i_will probably not_like
but_hey
free is the_right price to try_new_things
so i_tried_a new thing and really_enjoyed_it
i_can't_say if_it_was good_or bad in lassi terms as_i_have nothing to_compare it_to
but_i_can say_i plan_on trying more lassi's now so_that i_can find_out
and_i_think that's a_pretty_good sign for it's tastiness
i_will_definitely_be_back for_the_lunch_buffet
but_i think_i_will need_to try some_of_the_other indian_places around_town before_i choose my
go_to
dinner joint
the a_la_carte_menu seems a_little_pricey around dinner_time here
but the_lunch_buffet price_is perfect_for me
i_came_in for_the_lunch_buffet_and i_was_surprised they_had more options than my_usual indian rotation
mint_and mt
everest
however
this_place_was quantity more_than quality
the_goat_curry was_really salty
like really
it masked the_flavor_of whatever spices they_put
the_vegetable mikhana
veggie tikka_masala
was_off
way off_to a_point it_was sourish
however
the_chicken mikhana
chicken_tikka_masala
was_actually tasty
i_guess they cook_it differently
the_chicken_was so_tender it_was shredding apart
i enjoyed_their palak_paneer as_well
but the_paneer_was too tough for_my_taste
it couldn't pick up the_flavor_of the_spinach and_spices
overall
i_would_not be_able_to fit this_place into_my rotation
however
service_was_great
my_water was_never empty and_i_was downing that water like crazy because_of_the goat_curry
i_went_in on_a_tuesday and_they charged me
which_is not right according_to the information on_this listing
or_maybe they overcharged me
this_place_has the_most awesome_food and best_service
manni is_the_best server ever and_made our_visit most memorable
best restaurant experience in_vegas
i_had purchased a living_social deal at the_last minute
we ended_up_going with a_huge party
i_had_a peach drink that_was on fire
don't recall the_name_of it
it_was delicous
our_server was_really_great
made spot_on suggestions cracked the occasional joke
for_a_table of we_ordered rogan_josh
sag paneer_and two_orders_of chicken_tikki_masala
two_orders_of rice_and two_orders_of garlic_naan
everything_was just delicious
not_a negative thing_to say_about the_entire meal
highly_recommend
never call them_for an_order
the_guy i_called for order_was rude_and impolite
i_am writing this_review even before tasting the_food
the_guy on_the_phone go me really worked up
i_am saying this even_though_i am an_indian
staff at_indian_restaurants can_be_a total ass
we've been looking_for_a_good indian_restaurant_in_vegas since_we moved from nyc and read about india_palace so decided to_check_it_out for_dinner
it_was_pretty quiet on a_sunday_night
there were_only a_few_other patrons
which_is_a shame because our_experience at_india_palace was_great
as_other yelpers mention
they_are located near the_strip but on_the border of_a crappy neighborhood
i_wonder if_they were_in a_better location if they_would_have more diners
but_i digress
they_served papadum and_different dipping_sauces when we_sat_down
which was_very_nice
we_started_with_the kheema samosas for an_appetizer
the shell was_nice_and crispy_and not_greasy at_all
they_were filled_with delicious ground lamb and_green peas
i_thought_it_was wonderful with_the date sauce
the dark brown one
on_it
we_ordered_the chicken_korma and_chicken_tikka_masala for_entrees
both were_very_good
the_chicken_was very_tender
the_entrees didn't_come with_rice
as has_been our_experience at most_indian_restaurants
so we_had_ordered a_side_of peas pulao rice_and_garlic_naan
i_loved_the rice_with peas_and nuts in_it
the_garlic_naan was_also_very_good and not_greasy at_all
service_was_attentive and_all_the staff very_friendly
the_restaurant_was neat and_clean
there_were tvs playing bollywood which_was fun
they_weren't on too loud and_i always find_it hard_to not watch
our_waiter provided us_with containers to pack our leftovers
if we_weren't so full
i_would_have_liked to_try_their dessert menu
our_dinner came_out_to about
including tax and tip
indian_food_is always a_little_pricey
so i_thought_it_was good_value_for what_we_got
we_enjoyed our_experience here_and will_definitely be_back_to_try other menu_items
the_dosas in particular
they honored the free_mango_lassi for checking_in
which_was_delicious with my_meal
thanks yelp
i_live out east and_have dined here during_my last trips_to vegas
the_food_is_very_good
the_staff very_nice
well sized portions as_well
good_value_for your money
will_definitely go_back would_recommend_this_place to friends
very_good hotel
food_tasted really_nice
they_have_a gift card for_that you_may possibly use immediately if you bought this before seating
also
they may give_you of if_you_are group_of or_more
this_is_my_favorite indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
the_people here_are all really_nice_and helpful
the_food_is_delicious_and very consistently so
i_love that_when_i order spicy
they_actually make_it spicy
some ethnic restaurants assume americans can't tolerate a_little heat
the_location_is a_little dodgy but the_interior_is actually quite_nice and inviting
be_on_the lookout for coupons and specials they participate in a_lot_of_the usual deal sites
food_is_very_good
the_owners_are great
but_the manager_was unprofessional
he may no_longer be_there
we_ordered_a groupon_and called in_and explained that_we_had a_groupon worth and_ordered some_food to_go
i clearly explained my groupon
and_there_was no problem_with the to_go order_from_the employee on_the_phone who_was polite
after driving miles
we_arrived
the_manager said the_groupon is_for dining_in only
i_said
why did they not tell_me that on_the_phone
as_i told_them i had_a_groupon
anyway
he_did not_want_to honor the promotion
then_i asked him his name
and_he wouldn't tell_me his name
he said they_don't make any money on the_groupon
i_said
then why do_you offer it
that_is not_my problem
i bought it
ordered
and_then drove miles
and_now he is_not wanting_to honor the promotion
did you read_the fine print
he_asked
no i_said
instead
i_called your restaurant_and explained that_i_had a_groupon and they_took my_order
and_i in good faith came all this_way expecting a_smile and_a thank_you
and now_i get_a no
and he_was_very mean to_me
disrespectful
not_being considerate at_all
of_course this upset me
and_i began_to raise my voice
then_he was upset that_i raised my voice in_his restaurant
i_told_him
i_did_not come_here to raise my voice
i_came_here for_some tikka_masala
but i_will_never come_here again
trust_me
it_is unfortunate
that_they_have such_good food_here
yet
the_manager is_a hothead
and_i feel sorry for the_employees that_have to_work for_him
the poor guy that took my_order
oh_my
he_is going_to_get the wrath
he_did not_want_to listen to anything i_said
in spite of_it all_i still tipped him just_because i_am someone that_has worked in_the_restaurant industry
and_i follow the golden rule
but_i_will tell you
this manager_was a_real jerk
now
there_are_so many restaurants out_there that would_love to_have_a customer that drives miles to_come to_them
and_they will_do everything_in their power to_make that customer feel special
this manager threatened to_call the police on_me
can_you believe_that
wow
if_he worked for_me i_would fire him so fast
anyway
this_is_a good restaurant and_they_have good_food
and_i_am sure the_owners_are good people
they_need to_help their people understand the promotions
and_then make sure that_every customer interaction is appreciated
i_really_like_the food
it_is unfortunate that i_have_had so_much grief here
i blame the_manager
no cs skills whatsoever
anyway
i_do think_this_is a_good restaurant
the_owner call me_up after this an apologized for the_experience i_had
i thanked him for_the call
this_is_a lovely restaurant
and_the_food_is fantastic
i_say go ahead_and give them another_chance
i've_been_here before_and had tried_to find_it again_to no avail
a_friend_and i happened_to both want_indian at the_same_time
but having no_idea where to_go turned to_my trusty yelp app and_it found_this awesome_place for_me again
it's tucked off in a_little shopping area
but_well lit and_easy to_find
it's got_a great
cozy interior with roomy booths and_indian movies playing constantly
it_has a_full_bar also
checked_in using my yelp app and received a_free drink called a_mango_lassi
i_would_never have_known to_ask_for this had i not gotten this check_in offer
but_i'm so glad_i_did
it_was seriously delicious
it's mango and_yogurt and_it_was part_of_the reason i_couldn't eat all_of my_food
highly_recommend you_get this fabulous drink
for an_appetizer we_had vegetable_samosas
they_were dense and_a_little dry
but_with the_spicy cilantro sauce to_put on_it it_tasted just fine
you_get two and_they're a_nice size
for_dinner my_friend_had chicken_tikka_masala
which
while not outside_the box is_definitely_a solid choice
he liked_it and proceeded_to eat all_of_it
i_had_the mata paneer_and it_was_just the_right spicy
medium
with a_rich tomato y taste mixed_with peas_and the_paneer cheese
had_it over_a bed_of jasmine rice and_it_was super filling
one_of_my_favorite dishes
also_ordered a_side_of_garlic naan_which_was okay
it_wasn't the_best_i've_ever_had
way_too much garlic
but_it_was find and_went okay with_the_meal
the_service_here can_be spotty
i_wasn't impressed_with that at_all
but_it's_not the_worst i've_had
so
anyway
great_food
nice_atmosphere and at_a reasonable_price
definitely_recommend
i_really_enjoyed this_place
food_was extraordinary
my_girlfriend_and i_tried two dinner specials and we_really_enjoyed everything
prices_are_pretty high
but you_get what_you_pay for
i_was_told its the_best place_in_vegas by my_fellow indian frds but_was ver much disappointed
i_was_not welcome will a_short built guy pointed and showed me the_table_and wen i ask him a_drink he said the_bartender was_not there
so_i_asked him a red_wine cabernet he instead bought me_a white wine
the_food_was_excellent and gr but_the_service_was moderate
there_was no refill on my_water wen i_needed most
i_really did_not know_why my_server was angry and_he smelled of alcohol too
das was around
and_there ver only tables
anyways thanks_to the_chef and my_fellow friends_for recommeding for_the lovely food
first_time trying_it
and_i'm already in_love_with it
best_indian_food out_there
we had_dinner before it_got real busy which_was o
k
with_me
try_the hayward imported indian_beer
the_food_was_great and_the_service wasn't_bad
not_the greatest part_of_town but oh_well
glad_we went
this_place_has great_food
i_love_the chicken_korma_and the basil naan a_bunch
whenever_i am in_las_vegas
i_try and make_it to_india_palace
it's off_the_strip but_not_too far away but_would require a_short cab ride
but in_my_opinion
it's better_than any_of_the places on_the_strip for_indian_food
give_them_a try
we_came on_a_friday_night and_ordered
vegetable_samosa appetizer
tandoori_chicken dinner
for
used the_groupon to_get credit
came_out_to
seated_right away
fancy restaurant
dim lighting
wine style cup glasses
edwin was_a friendly server
he seemed_to appreciate that we_came_in to_eat indian_food_and made_sure that_our drinks_were refilled and_the_food made to_our liking
they_didn't_have the lamb_samosa tonight
which_we were_a_bit disappointed so_we ended_up_with the_vegetable
comes_with
cooked fresh_and crispy
you_are given complimentary flat_bread and types_of sauces
mild
med
hot
flat_bread tasted a_bit burnt
but crispy
garlic_naan_was fluffy
chicken soup_was watery but spicy
mango dessert was_good
tasted like filipino fruit salad
fried vegetables were_a_bit smushy
tandoori_chicken_was a slighly dry_and the onoins were grilled inconsistently
undercooked or overcooked
india_masala and mint_bistro packs more_flavor for_my_liking than india_palace
but nonetheless
still a_good eat especially_with the_groupon
i_wish_i_could get_here more often
the_service_is_very good_and_the food_is_amazing
the seating is_nice
this_place_is much better_than more popular places i_won't mention
took a_friend here_and we_were_both very_pleased
everything_was top_notch
give_it_a try
we_had_the chicken_korma_and goat karahi
which_was fantastic
nan_and rice was_very_nice
might want to_ask_for extra spicey as_they tend to_cater_to the_white man
overall the_service_was_good
kitchen could_have_been_a little quicker and the_bartender more knowledgeable
but_otherwise a_great_place_for a_tasty meal
there's lots_of coupons floating around_the web for_this_restaurant
so there's no reason to_pay full price
but even_if_you do end_up paying full price
the_cost is_reasonable
they_have_a large menu featuring many vegetarian_dishes
chicken
lamb
goat
and_other traditional indian_foods
their_lamb menu_is_extensive
and_being a_huge_fan_of lamb
i get_some variety_of lamb every_time_i come_here
i_haven't eaten a_single thing here_that i_didn't_like
their_naan is_to_die_for
particularly the_garlic_naan
i_wasn't a_big_fan_of their_buffet
it_was small_and there weren't very many spicy_dishes
however
for_those nervous about trying_indian_food for_the_first_time
the_buffet menu offers a_variety_of mild
common indian_dishes
they_also serve you a_plate_of naan
i_would_say this_is_one_of_the_best indian places_in_town at_this price range
the_waiters could_be more courteous_and not have_an expression that_made me_feel like i've entered a funeral home
buffet_items were bland_and blah
rotis were_delicious
nice_ambience
my gripe with_this_place just_like most_indian_places is the_lack_of spice_and flavor in they food
for_some_reason the_dishes lack the character of_their indian counterparts
in_india the_same dish will_be extremely flavorful
my_first mistake i_guess comparing with_the taste back_home
but what's the_point in calling yourself fine indian_cuisine if_you_can't be authentic_and recreate the_exact flavors
also
my_mom without knowing the
rules of_the land
asked_for pickles
the_staff_were extremely helpful_and got her a_cup full_of it_and later slipped me an_extra
when asked why he goes oh
if it's_not on_the_menu then you_pay
ok
why can't you tell her that first
instead_of slipping one_in
not that_i_had a_problem paying_for it
he_is right
but the_lack_of customer_service or ethics just irked me
buffet_is reasonably_priced with enough items
improve customer_service
remember it's the_customer who makes or breaks your business
improve flavor don't_forget the roots of_the_dish
i_know_it is dumbed down to_cater_to local tastes but_hey if_i want_to_eat bland food_i_have lot_of cheaper and healthier options
awesome_food
great_atmosphere
food was_a_bit expensive but totally_worth it
went on_a_thursday evening_and it_was_still crowded
usually a_really_good sign considering_that the_restaurant_is in_a weird part of_las_vegas
looked shady
the_inside of_the_restaurant was_really well_decorated and we_felt comfortable once_we settled in
checked_in on_yelp_and got_a free_mango_lassi
wow
really_tasty
had the_samosas_and aloo_tikki
both good
had_the non_veg curry thali and_all_the components was_fantastic except the mango_custard
next_time_i_will try something else
it_came_with lamb_in spinach
chicken_tikka_masala_and shrimp_curry
excellent
we_will_be_back soon
best_indian_food_i_have ever_had_in america
we_ordered_the goat lamb_dishes
garlic_naan this phenomenal rice dish
the_waiter_was very_nice helped us place our_order
we_wanted to_try_something_new yet more traditional
the setting was quiet comfortable
don't_let_the neighborhood scare you
this_is_a_must have
this will_be_a place we will_always come_back_to when we_visit vegas
the_food_is_good
but_don't bother trying_to get delivery from_them
the_last three_times they cancelled my_order
first they_didn't_have a driver
then they
had_a flat tire
i_don't_know their excuse for the_third time
they_are currently on grubhub and_eat
not ordering from them_again
this_is our favorite_indian_restaurant
the_food_is_excellent
the_portions_are quite generous without being excessive
and_the_service_is attentive_and usually pretty fast
love_this_place
curries_are very_tasty their_naan_is oh_so yummylicous
the_chicken_korma is_so_good my wife's exact words where
my vagina gets wet every_time_i eat_this sauce
only if_i_had known
it_was_not love at_first sight for my_friend indian_food_and myself
in_fact
we hated one another pretty_good in the_beginning
all_of that changed after my_first_experience at_india_palace
to_be_honest
i've_only eaten_at two indian_restaurants in_my_life
after eating_here
i'm not_sure i_will venture elsewhere
so on_a lonely afternoon my_wife and_i_decided_to ditch our co_workers and meet for_lunch
fortunately india_palace had a_yelp dealio going down where you_get of grub for
a stellar deal
no restrictions were mentioned upon purchase
however when_i presented the_coupon the_server said_it_was only valid for_dinner
after explaining there_were_no restrictions mentioned in_the disclaimer or at_the_time of purchase he graciously accepted the_coupon and we_enjoyed their_lunch_buffet with_two refreshing pepsi cola beverages
i'm a_huge_fan_of their_tandoori_chicken
but the_meal wouldn't_be complete without their piping_hot
freshly baked nan
i_could honestly make_a meal just out_of that
my_favorite item at the_buffet_is the_chicken_tikka_masala
which_is tandoori_chicken marinated_in yogurt spices_in a_creamy tomato sauce
it's
am and my_mouth is watering just thinking_about_it
i_even enjoyed a serving_of their creamy spinach
popeye would_be proud
the_service at_india_palace is_always exceptional
the_servers_are friendly_and_attentive
your drink never stays empty for long
plates are whooshed away at lightening speed upon completion
and_i always leave here feeling good about_my experience_and reminded as_to why i've never gone_to any_other_indian_restaurant
glowing stars
india_palace never disappoints
chicken_tikka_masala is_amazing_and the bhindi_masala is_delicious
we always_get garlic_naan_with our_meal and make_sure_to order extra to_take_home
my_husband_and_i try to_come_here as often as we_can
went_here_with my_boyfriend today and_loved_it
the_food_was_delicious
especially the_chicken marsala
great_service by both the_waiter
who was_friendly_and fast
and the_kitchen staff that brought_the food_out
overall a_great_experience
i_just tried_this_place today
it_was_delicious
i bought a_groupon for_it
we_had some_of_the vegetarian_options on hand
totally authentic_and delicious
great_service too
my_wife was_craving_indian_food so_we_went to_her favorite_indian_restaurant
i_ordered_a taj_mahal beer free_mango_lassi with_the yelp_check_in
we_ordered_the following food_items
vegetable_samosa
garlic_naan
chicken_tikka_masala
mixed grilled tandoori
everything_was excellent as_usual
our_server garry was_very_nice_and helpful
i promised to_let everyone know that_he was_the_best
went_there_for lunch_buffet
not the_nicest experience
we shouldn't have even stayed to_eat but i_wanted_to be fair and_give things a_taste
everything looked_like it_had_been sitting_in the_serving trays for_days
the_meat looked grey and_dry
as_well_as_the meager amount of jasmine they_put out
and_the_quality_of_the meat didn't seem that well
meat_was chewy
i_wasn't the_goat
service_was slow_and mostly unresponsive
went_there_for dinner_at pm
got crowded at_about pm
full house
building was_nice on_the_outside
but did_not expect the dumpy location around it
thinking diamond in_the rough
not_quite
service_was_good until it_got busy then it_was_ok
i_had_to go up_to_the bar to cash the_check cause i didn't_see waiter for_a_while
food_was neutral
not_really bad_but not_great
garlic_naan_was really the_best_thing
i_was_expecting more flavors but it_was_ok
they_got my_order wrong
chicken instead_of shrimp
shrimp came out rubbery
they_take tail off
small shrimp
chicken tica tamdoori was_good_but they_brought that out like_it_was an_appetizer
it_was_my husband's main entr_e
i'm_not sure_what happened with_that
but we_weren't going_to complain in_front_of friends
plus the_onions such were_not cooked all_the_way
i don't_eat raw onions
they barely cooked them
small_portions for price
don't know we would_go_back unless friends absolutely wanted_to_go there
too_bad because_i thought we_found the_best_indian place_in_town
apart from_the mediocre food
the_service_is worst
they_don't honor yelp deals
definitely a_place_to avoid
we_came_here with_the intention of getting take_out
we_were_greeted by vick who was_very_friendly_and helpful
he offered suggestions on drink_and appetizer while_waiting
his cheerful demeanor won us over_and we_decided_to dine_in
the_restaurant_was very_clean
his service_was_excellent_and the_food_was_very_good
vick makes excellent suggestions for_food choices
based_on_the area the_restaurant_is in we_were pleasantly_surprised at the_quality_of service we_received
highly_recommended
for_being in_a highly tourist concentrated area
it's mins away_from_the las_vegas strip
this_restaurant_is fantastic
my_family of_four was greeted_and seated_immediately by vick
he_was kind and_went out_of his way to_make suggestions and_even make jovial conversation
the_food_was_fantastic and_the_portions large considering we_have enough left_overs to_make_a meal out_of
would_definitely_recommend to tourists and locals alike
india_palace_is a_very_good indian_restaurant
very_good_indian_food not_like others which really dont taste indian
and whenever u go_there as_for manny
he was_very_nice_and funny made_us_feel very comfortable
excellent_indian_food
i_enjoyed_the special vegetarian_dinner and mixed appetizers
gary
our_server
was_very_attentive to_our needs
friendly atmosphere
i_have_been dining here for_over years
i_am_an indian who_is very passionate about_my food
each_time_i visit india_palace
food_and_service always exceeds expectations
our top favorite items_on_the_menu are chicken_tikka_masala
paneer_tikka
bhindi_masala and malai_kofta
the_staff_is very_polite_and go_out_of their way_to give_you best possible service
today our_server_was gary
i_forgot my gift card in_the_restaurant and_he ran out_to the_parking_lot in_the cold weather
looking_for us_and handed me my gift card which still had_a balance_of
thank_you gary and thank_you india_palace for taking care_of my_indian_food cravings for_all these years
you are_the_best
it_has_been years since_i review about this_restaurant
i_would_like_to add my compliments towards our_server garry again
as_always
we_were_greeted with_a warm welcome by garry
he has_been superb and_accommodating
garry introduced us_to the_tandoori dinner and_i_must_say it_was_delicious
we_had masala_dosa the yummiest lamb_biryani
love their_chai too
great_experience as_always
thanks garry for_the number one customer_service rendered to_us
awesome service by_our fave server garry
outstanding
great_job
thank_you
food_was_great
our_server garry was_great too
the_manager was professional
he honored my yelp checkin free_mango_lassi
which_was yummy
and yelp's for deal too without any hesitation
we_were a_group_of four for_dinner_and it turned_out_to be total including_the above discounts
tip and taxes
would_love_to go_again
i_was_in the_mood_for indian while_visiting las_vegas_and i_liked that they_offer_a free_mango lasi for checking_in on_yelp
the_first_time_i visit an_indian_restaurant i stick_with certain dishes
i_ordered_the malai_kofta
chicken_tikka_masala
samosas
and garlic_naan_bread
the_naan_bread was_the_best part_of_the_meal
it_was well_made and_came out piping out
the_samosas_were so oily that_i barely touched then
the_malai_kofta had_a_nice flavor
but i_did_not enjoy the_chicken_tikka_masala at_all
it_tasted a_little like feet
my_meal wasn't terrible but_i_didn't like_that_they charged for_both the_rice_and the_naan_bread
one is_usually complimentary when_you_order an_entree
i_probably would_not return because there_are_plenty_of indian_restaurants to_try in_las_vegas
the_management at_this_place has_no regard for it's patrons whatsoever
we_came_in for_a_lunch_buffet and_the_food selection_was sub par to_say_the least
we_were a_group_of and_we_were treated with such disrespect that_it_is appalling
we_tried using a_yelp deal_and not_only were they unwilling to accept it they_were_very rude about telling us_that it they cannot take_it
the_rest rooms at_this_place were the_worst of_all_the restaurants_in_vegas
i'd give no stars if_i_could
avoid this_place like_a plague
there_are much better indian_restaurants_around
the_food_was_good i'll give them that
but_their service_and credibility are questionable
though i_strongly recommend looking elsewhere for_indian_food if you_must go_here check your bill
these_guys messed up our bill and_then refused to address it saying_that during_the holidays that's_what their policy is
they_also don't take gift cards during_the holidays and apparently all of_las_vegas recognizes the holidays as december th through december st
though_i don't work in_the_restaurant industry i_still have work tomorrow
also they took_forever_to take_our_order
then forgot what we_ordered and_had_to take_it again
and_brought dishes out one at_a time
cause maybe some_people like cold food
either way service being shitty
not the_only_place
but blatantly cheating customers is a_whole new level_of shady
it's good_food but_if_you must go be_careful
manpreet aka manny is_awesome
he totally helped us_out and fed us soooo much_food
we_could hardly move
awesome_food amazing_service
a_favorite when in_vegas
authentic food_and_great_service
a go_to_indian getaway from_the_strip
not_as full for an_early dinner
full menu_and about miles from_the_strip
amazing_food
server vick is_the_best
so charming
excellent customer_service
consumer beware
beware
before going to_this_restaurant
they_have raised all their_prices including buffet_which is_now at_a ridiculous
per_person
nowhere do they inform you of the_new prices until u get the_bill
we_ordered from_the_menu as_well_and the_quantity is_a joke even one_person cannot eat on_the ridiculously priced dal
the_buffet_was even worse with stale food
empty buffet trays that were_being refilled at snails pace with just_a_few pieces_of_chicken that_are now cut in half than previously served
dessert milk had gone bas with pungent taste
bread was_cold
tixe was_hard as_a rock
which_means it_was from_the day before_and re heated
glasses smelled similar_to foul meat which_means not cleaned thoroughly
we are_very dissappointed we_were regulars at_this_restaurant and_don't know what happened
maybe its new_management or_maybe its just_the want_to make money and_let go of_quality and serve your customers horrendous quality_of_food whatever the_case they have_gone downhill
save yourself the_bad experience_and do_not eat_here not worth_it anymore
for_this price you_can_eat at_a fancy restaurant_in_vegas
on_a positive note the_waiters are_nice
and thats about it_on_the niceness part
a note to management
do_not rip un suspecting customers your prices have_gone up_and quality_is horrible
great_place
chicken_tikka_masala is_one_of the_best_i've_ever_had
great_service_and nice and_clean
highly_recommended
first_time_here
simply awesome
tried_the_buffet for new taste options
goat_curry is_delicious
rice_pudding is_perfect dessert with an_indian coffee
my_brother had the_goat briyani
very_good
spiced just_right
we_will_be_back
excellent
we_found_this_place with
groupon
and will_definitely go_back when in_vegas
i_agree the_chicken marsala was the_best_i've_had anywhere
the_naan_was fresh_and_hot and my_mouth is watering just thinking_about_it
loads_of flavor
very_attentive
friendly_staff who take pride in_their delicious selections
thank_you manny
loved_it
hope to_see you again soon
great_food but inattentive staff
we_were visiting_vegas for new year's using the_deal we_got from livingsocial
we had_no_idea that_this_was only_for regular dining not the_buffet
after a_minute of standing there
somebody flagged down a_waiter for_us_to have us seated
not_sure if_he was_a diner or the_owner but thank_you whoever you_are
we_were_seated in the_corner and_the_waiter didn't seem_to care because_he left us alone for about_minutes without_a menu or telling us what_was going_on
after observing everyone else
we noticed_that they_just got_up and_served themselves
apparently it_was_a buffet
so
we_decided_to do the_same
after we_were_done with our_meal
that_was when another waiter came up_to us and_told_us that_our livingsocial deal was_supposed_to_be for_the regular_menu not the_buffet
he_asked the_manager_and they decided_to honor it
the_meal_was good because they_had_a variety to_choose_from
i_just wished the had staff that_were more attentive
you won't find a_better indian_food_restaurant west of_the mississippi
ask_for manny when_you stop_in
excellent_food the_flavors
the_environment and_the_service
my_server garry came to_check on_me several_times and_took great care_of me start experience
this_place rocks
i_have_eaten_at indian_places all_over_the western us_and i've_never_had better_indian_food than this_place
garry
our_waiter
was_incredibly nice and_gave us fantastic_service
every single dish we_have_tried is_better_than any_other place here_in_vegas
so_far we_have_tried the_chicken_korma
chicken_vindaloo
malai_kofta
and_the_chicken_tikka_masala and_they_are all to_die_for
the meat_is cooked_perfectly and the_sauces are_so_good you_will lap it_up from your_plate
give these_guys a_try
you won't regret_it
i_went_to india_palace a_few_days ago with_a_friend for_the_lunch_buffet
it_was_delicious
i_am vegetarian so_i appreciated that the_buffet_had several vegetarian_options
my_friend_had the_tandoori_chicken_and she said it_was_very_good
i_can't comment too_much on_the service
because the_buffet does not require much from the_server
in_the_past i_have_had very_good service_at dinner_time
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was honestly the_best_i've_ever_had
the_sauce_was smooth and_perfectly spiced
the_cheese_naan was very_light and_soft and_perfectly paired the_masala
the only_complaint was_that_the masala didn't_come with_rice
just ate_at the india_palace and wow
tandoori_chicken_was moist_and delicious
chicken_tikka_masala_was maybe the_best_i've_ever tasted and_the_curry was_perfect
top_it off_with great naan_bread_and unbelievable service_from manny and_the result is_my_first yelp review ever
i've_had indian_food_in various countries to include england and countries very_close_to india and_this_is in the_top ever
we ventured into_this neighborhood trying to_get_some neat food_on a_cold night
since it_was_our_first night in_vegas_and we dint know_this side_of_the city very_well we_ended_up coming in the_wrong side out from_our hotel and_i_must_say the route was_super scary to_walk by
i barely thought of_how could any restaurant be tucked in_this neighbourhood
once we_went_in we_were_seated and we_ordered malai_kofta
very enriching taste
and korma with_naan
the_food_was overall very_good
the_service_was not_exactly great or worth mentioning but_the power of_food overpowered the_service_and hence the solid four_stars
this_restaurant was a_wonderful experience
it's located_in_a seedy part_of_the road
but it_is_a find
you_know when there's_a limo in the_parking_lot
that's_a clue
they_have_an extensive_menu
so we_tried_the aloo_tikki appetizer
and_it_was four tasty fried cakes and very_good
then
we_ordered_the basic items we use to_tell one restaurant from another
the_lamb_korma is_great
with_more lamb than_most others
and_the_lamb is very_tasty_and tender
there_is enough sauce
so you_can_have just sauce_and rice
too
yummy
the_chicken_tikki marsala is very_tender
again with_more chicken than usual
very_good sauce
the_garlic_naan_is perfect
very lightly crispy on_the surface
and_chewy inside
with_a dusting of herbs for_good looks
you_know
every_dish here_is pretty
too
they_make a firm vodka martini
and_the recommended taj_mahal beer was_just_right
good_service
very_attentive
and
auntie tarala
will tell you with_a lift of her eyebrow if_you_get it_right
the charming manager stopped by_to answer questions
and_be sure_we were_happy
we_were
so you_can_have a_lovely indian_meal
at_a reasonable_price
without_the noise and crowds of_the_strip
just minutes away
in_an easy drive
the parking_is a_free lot
i_have_been_to many_indian_restaurants around_and this_one is_by_far_the_best and my_favorite
it_was refreshing to_be greeted by manny with such spectacular hospitality as if_we_were family_and the_customer_service was_amazing
he was_extremely_friendly and_pleasant and_made my_experience there top_notch
vick was_wonderful and_helpful as_well
the_food_was phenomenal
much so_that we_went_back two more_times during_our stay in_las_vegas
every_dish was_so absolutely_delicious and seasoned perfectly
also
the_portions_were quite generous_and they_had_a huge vegetarian selection
with service_and_food that was_out_of_this_world
there_is no need_to_go anywhere else
i_will_definitely_be returning every_time i_go_to vegas
india_palace_is my_favorite_place to_dine_in vegas
although a buck or_two more_than others for_the_lunch_buffet
it's_worth_it
it's the_tastiest i've_had so_far
the_manager was_very_helpful pointing out the_vegan offerings
even offering an all_i_can eat from_the_menu if the_buffet didn't suffice
it_did and was_very_tasty
he even_brought me lentil crackers
since their bread_was non vegan
nice_atmosphere inside
nicely_decorated
for my_personal taste
shared by very few
it_was too_salty
but my_friends found it_very_much to_their liking
i checked_in for the_mango lasi
but gave_it to a_friend bcuz it's non vegan
my_friend loved_it
it_is where it_is
but you're driving
right
if_you_like_indian_food
check_this out
the_owner_is from punjab
we_went_there on_a_weekday night by pm
as the_place closes by
pm
they refused to_let us dine_in but said_that we can_order take away
we_ordered plain naans
garlic naans and_chicken_tikka_masala
we_waited_for mins but we_were_not given any update on our_order
only when_we started_to pester them about our_order they hurried into the_kitchen to_get_it ready
the_taste_of the_food_was_good
the_parking_lot was_a_bit cramped
it would_have_been full if_we_had come_by pm
service_was the_main negative of_this_place
they_were_not hospitable to_us
too business oriented and_in your_face attitude
i_had_the chicken_tika marsala with almond and cashew rice
now
i_eat a_ton_of indian_food_and i've_had my_favorite_place for_years now
as of tonight
there's_a new_favorite in_my quiver
manny served me tonight and_he_was great
as_was everybody else
i'll be_back
very_good_food
i_came_here a_couple_times for_their_lunch_buffet and paid about
incl tip
each time
if_you're_a big eater
i_would_say it's well_worth_it
the_staff_is_friendly_and provided us good_service each time
amazing_food
it_came to_us extremely hot just right_off_the stove
hands off_to the_chef with_his skills this_place_is_amazing
service_was_great see manny for_his excellent customer_service and_his perfect timing
would_definitely come back_to_this_place next_time i'm here from la
this_is a_hidden_gem
it's_in_a bad neighborhood but_the_food_is worth_the_trip
it's possibly the_best_indian_food_i've_ever had
our_waiter vick was_super knowledgeable and entertaining
for_me
this_place_is never a_bad choice
and they've always got awesome bollywood vids playing
very_good buffet_lunch spread and a_mango_lassi worth yelping out
this_place_is way off_the_strip and_a
pitstop worth_the ride for_all indian_food fanatics
the mutton chicken_dishes are_good and_nothing beats an all_you_can_eat buffet for_under
i_went out_to dinner and_was in_search_of indian_food a_couple_of_weeks ago
i_decided_to_try this_place_because there_was_a coupon available
i_ordered chicken_vindaloo
garlic_naan_and some_rice
the_food_was_fantastic
and i_asked_for extra_spicy frequently i_have issues with restaurants not making the_food spicy_enough but_they did_a great_job here at_india_palace without ruining the_flavor
also
the_server
mani
was_fantastic
great attitude
good humor and_took care_of me the_entire time
i_will_definitely_be_back
i_love_indian_food
india_palace_is probably_the_best indian_food_you can_get in_vegas
the_service_is_great
the_food
even_better
there_are only_two suggestions i can_make to management
please change the god awful television playing on_the_wall
it_is like watching a mexican sitcom
they_all look the_same
everything_is over acted and_nothing is funny
well
the_same can_be said about_what is_on_the tvs at_india_palace
i_like wine
servers at_india_palace will cork the_wine behind_the bar_and bring an uncorked bottle to_the_table
this_is_a big no no in wine service
see my_review of_the broiler in hawaii
anyway
visit_this_place
the_tv is terrible
wine is uncorked
wine faux pas
but_the service_and_food are spot_on
this_is_the_best indian_food_in_vegas
beautiful decor
full_bar
there is_definitely_a master spicer behind_the kichen door
wow
fabulous food and_courteous waitstaff
the combination dinners are_a tremendous value
more food_than one can_eat
and they_even let me substitute one_of_the_dishes
i_will_be_back again
so_good
my_husband_and_i hadn't had_indian in_a_long_time
and_the_waiter there was_so_nice and_helpful
he_gave us great advice based on_our preferences and_what we'd be sharing
the_food_was marvelous
the_service quick_and friendly
plus
we_loved that_they_had a_selection_of indian_beers the_perfect complement to the_spiciness
we'll definitely be_back
i_love_indian_food_and begged my_friends to_go try_this_place out with_me
the_location looks small
but_it's actually really roomy when you_get inside
the_parking_lot was_really tiny though
but_it_wasn't crazy crowded so it_wasn't_too much_of an_issue
with_the_food
i_was_really delightfully surprised_by this dollar indian_buffet
it_was_excellent
some_of the_food_was_not as warm as_i thought it_would_be
which_was sort of_a turn off for_me
it probably_would have_tasted better if_it_were warmer
i did_enjoy the_saag_paneer as_well as any dishes_that had_chicken in_it
our_experience with service_was_good
our_waiter_was very_friendly_and_attentive
although he was_a_bit_slow with the_check and_water
honestly
i_would_go again
i'm_going_to get food made_to_order
so_it's hot
but_i_am definitely willing to_come_back
don't pass this_place over_and don't_forget_to use that check_in deal
my_experience with dining at_indian_restaurants are_pretty much buffet
buffet
non buffet
and buffet
india_palace_is probably my nd favorite right_now but_it's probably still_a
star place
it's_located on the_south side_of twain some where between swenson and paradise
it's not_in_the best locations but_it's_not that far from_the_strip or university which is_always_good
they_offer_a lunch_buffet m f for pretty much the_same_price as every_other indian_lunch_buffet north of
the selections aren't huge but for_what they_offered mostly delicious
again i'm_not that experienced with_indian_food so i_don't_even know what the_dishes_are called so_i made a_plate_of everything_i liked and_took a pic
http
www
yelp
com_biz_photos india_palace las_vegas
select vwiliowvruumaseo vb sa hzgrixobisfswoe ea lq there_were_a couple dishes_which seemed spicier_than the_other places_i've_been to_and i_really_enjoyed
the_garlic_naan here_was the_best_i've_had
the_red chicken_was spicy just the_way i_liked_it
there's potential to_be my_favorite_place but_i couldn't
i_only really liked maybe or of_the_items on_the_buffet
at_the_time there_was_a free lassi_with yelp_check_in unfortunately they_only accepted one for_our entire party but_i got_it haha
the_mango_lassi_was good
great_way_to end the_meal
the_interior_is nice with_many tables and_a_few tv's playing indian movies
it_seemed_like a_pretty full_bar
their parking situation isn't great
sevice was_alright
i'd be_back
during day
i had_the_chicken_tikka_masala and_it_was_delicious
i_would_have_to say_this_is probably_the_best masala i_have_tasted in_a_long_time and_i_have been_to_many_indian restraunts around the_country
the bryani also was_tasty
i_will_be_back soon
the_flavors_were amazing in all_the_dishes i_tried
ac
i_love_it here
everything we_ordered_was great
gary is_the friendliest and_most helpful waiter
i recommend_this_place to_anyone_who is looking_for some_good indian_food_and great customer_service
my_husband_and_i went here_for_the_first_time
the papadums were_tasty and_came with_three sauces
mint
spicy and_a brown one
i_like_the brown one
not_sure what flavor it_is
the_mint and_spicy sauces_were too spicy_for_me since_i'm pregnant
our starters was papdi chaat which_was crunchy with_a_great taste
for_our main_courses
we_shared_the chicken_tikka_and shrimp jalfrezi with_rice_and roti
the_rice_is a_huge portion which_we didn't_even eat half_of
the_chicken_tikka was_very_tasty with_the onions_and peppers
the_chicken_tikka tasted even_better with_the brown sauce_that comes_with the papadums
the_shrimp jalfrezi was_great over_rice and placed on_the roti
the_food_is_delicious
the_service_was_great
indians always know_how_to give good_service
vick was personable
attentive_and had many great recommendations and_made dining here very pleasurable
the_food_was staggered and_kept coming
start to_finish everything_was_delicious
i_get into town times per year_and definitely will_be_back next_time
don't miss this_little hidden_gem off_the_strip
excellent_food
i_got_the tandoori_chicken with_the medium spiciness which_was perfect
the_chicken_was perfectly_cooked and the_flavor_was really
really mouthwatering good
i also_got the_basmati_rice
which_was perfect as_well
the_cheese_naan was_worth_it as_well
very soft_and fresh with great_flavor
i_love_the mint sauce_that came along_with it and_the brown sauce was_excellent as_well
i_will come_back the_next_time i'm_in_vegas for business
i_ate a_bunch_of high end high rated food_in_the resorts while_i_was here and_this_is what stood out the_most
i'm partial to_this kind of stuff
though
but ultimately i'd_love to_try many_other things on_their_menu after_the awesome flavor_and great quality_of_the_food i_had here this evening
surprisingly nice all round
the_neighborhood is_no great shakes but the_restaurant_is top_notch
awesome
first the smells were_amazing when_i_walked into_the doors
then the_food_was_just as delicious as_the smells
i_was bought here a_while ago with_a_friend
i've never eaten_indian_food
i'm hooked
this buffet_style lets you check out other flavored and_spices
i'd_come here_before
pm
the_buffet starts going down hill
i've never ordered off_the_menu
why
when_you have so_many great flavored at_the_buffet
i like_this_place
it's clean cheap_and good
so_many flavor hit you palette it's not_even funny
i'd recommend_this_place_to at least try it_out
olmoosedog out
lunch_buffet_is typical of_most others
every_time i've been
it's_been good
pretty typical buffet selection
i_like_it
but_it's_not that special
not_sure what else to_say
great food_and_great_service
vick was_awesome
i_live at henderson but_i drive all_the_way here to_get masala_dosa
it's delicious
i_highly_recommend_this_place
i_have_only gone for_the_lunch_buffet and_i_must_say it is_pretty_good
all the_servers_are nice not_great but nice
this_is_my go_to_indian joint when_i_am craving_indian
definitely give_it_a try
the_food_in buffet was_good n the_people nice n friendly
for_me the_food could have_been_better if more_spicy
the_food_and restaurant was_good
we_love india_palace because it_has halal food_that caters to muslims
their_buffet was_superb as_always
i_am_a dosa lover
this_is_the_only buffet restaurant_with dosa included
garry was our_server and as_always he_gave while serving us
we appreciate him as_always
garry was_great with suggestions when asked about_the_food there
thanks again for_the being the_best
garry
food_was_delicious
we_loved the vegetarian_dinner
such great_flavor and a_beautiful presentation
i also_liked the_fact_that when i_ordered_a
mild
dish
it_was mild
yummo
as residents of_las_vegas
my_husband_and_i have been_to_many_indian cuisine restaurants throughout_the city
when_we discovered india_palace through restaurant
com
we_have never_been_to another_indian_restaurant since
they_say one_of_the signs of a_good ethnic restaurant_is when_you observe a_lot_of_people of_that ethnicity dining there
well
we_have
and one_time
even an entire tour bus of indian_people came_in
that's because the_food_is_excellent and_authentic
also
we enjoy mixed cocktails and most_indian_restaurants only serve beer_and_wine
india_palace has a_full_bar
and_the_service_is exceptional
we_have come_to know garry
and_he takes care_of us almost every_time
he's very committed to_our comfort and_that we_are having the_best dining_experience
parking_is super easy
right in_front
and_it's easy_to_get to
it's_right off_of a_main intersection
we_couldn't recommend_it more
personable and lovely staff
food_is_amazing
i_wish_i_could give_it_a thousand stars
found my_new favorite_restaurant
best_indian_food_in_las_vegas in_my_opinion
however i_have_only eaten_at total
if there_is_a better one please let me know
but_this india_palace_is legit
i_really_love everything on_the_menu but_my favorites_are the_chicken_vindaloo
tiki_masala
lamb_samosa
raita
garlic_naan_bread
tandoori_chicken
mango_lassi is_a_must also
you aren't going_to_get the_most incredible service_here but the_place_is_clean and_has_a very_nice classy atmosphere
it's all_about the_food_here
the_lamb_korma is_one_of_the_best things i've ever_eaten and_service_is impeccable
even_when using discount
definitely reasonable pricing and portions
don't_let_the neighborhood scare you this_is_a superior indian_place to_many in fancier locations
i've come_here_for ladies lunch and_family dinner same happy tummy
india_palace has_been my_go_to indian_food spot for_a_while now
i stick_to lunch_buffets as i_don't_really mess with dinner_at most_indian_restaurants
its usually just the_same served a_la_carte at higher prices
palace along_with majority_of the all_the indian_restaurants_in_town is located_in_a somewhat shady area just north of unlv
while the_area might suck
ip is_probably_the nicest building in_the_area which helps a_bit
going into_a indian_lunch_buffet i_know exactly_what_i want_to_eat
chicken_tikka
the boneless chicken chunks in_the creamy orange sauce
saag
spinch dip with extra butter
samosas
rice_and_naan
based of_this
india_palace delivers a great_lunch_buffet
the_food_is refreshed regularly
frequency depends on how_busy it_is
and_the_quality has_been consistent
my_one gripe is_that_they never give_you enough naan_and make_you wait when_you request more
the_restaurant as_i mentioned is pretty_nice
recently renovated and is_great_for large groups or_more intimate meetings but_the parking_is terrible
service_is average
they've messed up_my check several_times and i_have_had to_call them_out on_it every_time
remember_the yelp_check_in for_a free mango_lassie
only per table wtf
and_the yelp_deal
sorry to_say this_is_not_a restaurant i_would return_to
we eat_indian on are regular_basis
and i_would_say the_food_is average
maybe a_bit above
however the_main issue was the_service
our_waiter was_extremely_friendly
however we_were_there on_a_friday_night
and_there_was not_a crowd
it_was_a best full
first
they_had a_full_bar
but they_were_not serving drinks
apparently they sent the_bartender out_on_a delivery
and_no_one else could mix drinks
why they_did this on_a_friday_night is totally beyond me
we_also_had issues with the_waiter
while friendly
both waiters i_noticed spent the majority of_the_night on_the_phone
not taking orders
just talking
we struggled to_get their attention when_we needed_to
and several things_were missed on our_order
food was_extremely reasonable
however the_service issues were simply too_much for_us_to overcome
and thus we will_not_go back
ive been_here_times
not located_in_the best neighborhood but_it doesnt bother me because when_we walk_in
its very_clean_and friendly
as we_walked_in
we_saw a wall full_of pictures and_saw the_owner photographed with_some celebrities that_have also been_there
one_that caught my eye was_the celeb that played the_host in slumdog millionaire
as_they escorted us to_our_table
we_get greeted by waiters that remembered us_from last time
there has_been a_lot_of customers both_times we_have_been there but_still got amazing_service
plus
my mother in law who_is from england is very_picky when_it_comes_to food
before she left to england we_took her to_eat_here
she loves indian_food_and brags about the_indian_food restaurants_in england
but_when my_husband_and_i brought her here
she ate so_much she couldnt stop saying how delicious it_all was
the_service_has been super both_times
we_will_be_back
excellent_indian_food at a_great_price
if_you_are feeling overwhelmed by the_strip_and are_looking_for a_quiet and_delicious dining option go_here
everything on_the_menu_is soo good_and the_wait_staff are attentive_and grateful
constant thank yous even when_you_are being waited on
garry is especially kind_and knowledgable
if you put your_order in_his hands he_will make_sure_you are_happy
so what are_you waiting_for go eat_here now
first_off this_review_is_for_the so called 'customer service' here
so let me begin
my_friend_and_i had_been waiting all week to finally come_to this_spot to_try_indian for_the_first_time
i_had read all the_great_reviews about the_chicken_tikka_masala_and how_good the_garlic_naan_was so_we_were pretty excited_about it
as_we entered we_weren't really greeted politely
we_were kind of looked_at like we_were lost
i asked_the_waiter if we_could_have a table_for
so_he pointed and_said booth
so_we walked to_the nearest empty booth he_was possibly referring to
we_sat for_about a_couple minutes till the_same waiter came_over_and said
you're here for_the_buffet right
we looked_at each_other confused because_it_was our_first_time there so_i_asked him if we_were_able_to order from_the_menu
he looked annoyed and_went over_and grabbed a_couple menus and_brought them over
my_friend_and_i were already set on ordering ourselves the_chicken_tikka_masala because_of_the great_reviews and_the_garlic_naan as_well
we_waited a_few_more minutes then a_different waiter approached us_and asked_us if_we_were here for_the_buffet
i politely said_no we_are first timers and_not_too sure_what was being_served at_the_buffet
he_then described all_the choices
i_asked_if the_chicken_tikka_masala_was available and he_had said_no
i_also_had asked if the_garlic_naan would_be available at_the_buffet and_he_said no they_would_have to_make_it in_the_back and bring_it out
he_was really trying_to push us to_eat at_the_buffet but_we_were really set on trying the_dish we_wanted
so_he took_our_order of_chicken_tikka masalas and_the_garlic_naan
i_then asked_about the free_mango_lassi you receive if you check_in on_yelp
my_friend_and_i both showed our_check ins
then_he says that only_one person per table_with a_coupon gets a free_mango_lassi
which_was not stated on the_coupon or app that it_only applies for person
so_if you're going with_a_friend or friends
be_prepared that only_one of you_will_get a free_mango_lassi if you check_in here
during_the time while waiting_for our_order no_one approaches us_and let's us_know our_food will_be ready soon
or to re fill our_water cups or to check_in on_us at_all
finally our_food comes_out and_it's_a pretty_small bowl_of the_chicken_tikka_masala
a_few small pieces_of boneless chicken submerged in like ounces of_their sauce and_spices
but_it smells delicious
then a_basket_of the_naan which really wasn't much since we_both shared two pieces each
and a_bowl_of rice to_share between_the both_of_us
i_thought per order_of a_dish you_get your_own rice
but_i_thought wrong
food definitely stars
being_a first timer i_was satisfied
but_for the_price_of bowls_of chicken_tikka_masala
sharing a_bowl_of rice_and an_order_of garlic_naan
which came_out_to be_a_little over each
i'm disappointed
not_too sure_if he_had charged us the_dinner price_and gave_us_a lunch size meal
all in_all my_friend_and_i both enjoyed the_flavors_of indian_food for_the_first_time
but_will probably never come_back_here again
whoever heard_of serving chicken_masala without rice
an outrage
this_place serves chicken_masala in_a bowl full_of sauce_and expects you to_eat_it without soaking up the_sauce with_rice
about halfway through my_meal when_i had little chicken_and a_lot_of sauce left the_waiter finally asked_me if_i wanted some_rice
little did_i know at_the_time that the_rice
barely enough_for two
would cost an_extra
outrageous
i_have_never_been to_an india restaurant_that didn't serve their_dishes with_rice on_the side
but_this_one seems_to want_to soak you_for every dollar they can_get
decent_food but at_a steep price
i wont be_back
my_boyfriend_and_i went_here because_of a_group on deal for_dinner in which_you spend and_get off
overall the_food_took a_bit longer than expected to receive
especially since_it_was slow night customers wise
however it_was worth_the_wait
along_with this they_were_good about refilling our_drinks and clearing our_plates at_the_end
plus they_took the_group on without issue
something_i see a_lot_of restaurants trying_to get out_of when_i use groupons of some_kind
i_love_this_place
the_food_is so_fresh_and cooked_to_perfection
it's difficult_to find good indian_food_in_las_vegas
so this_restaurant_is quite a_gem
our_waiter
manny
was_just wonderful
very_attentive_and helpful
also
the coffee was_fantastic

i_can't even believe they_would serve this
the_veggies were half black from being burnt
requested a scrambled egg curry

the_guy helping us was_really_nice
listened to what_we_wanted and_kept saying he understood our special requests but_when the_curry and_sauces we_requested came out they_weren't what_we_wanted

i_think he_just thought he knew what_we_wanted
he_did try though which_was_nice

the_waiter gave a_bad look
ps
the_bill came_to after the_coupon
p
good_food_and huge_menu
but service isn't always as responsive as_it could_be
i_love_this india restaurant
probably_the_best one in_las_vegas
the prices_are_very_reasonable the_service_is awesome
i_like how_they always_have indian music_videos playing for their_customers also to show everyone what's the_indian culture is_about
i_think_they also_do have_a buffet_for_lunch for_all u can_eat
i_have_yet_to try_that but everytime i_go_there i_get_the chicken_biryani
my all_time fav indian fried_rice
i also_do recommend for_all_the new comers to_try_out the_chicken_tikka_masala the shish kebabs
let me_tell you if u don't_like spicy_food u may_have a_problem eating_here
but_hey
u can_also try mild but where_the fun in_that
overall i_like_the restaurant the_food_is_delicious
a_must_try indian_restaurant if u live or visiting_vegas
i_took_my cousin to_try_this_place as she_had never_had_indian before_and was interested in trying_it
she loved_it
we ordered_the_chicken_tikka and_a lamb_vindaloo
both were_excellent
but the_chicken_tikka_was amazing
i_was_pleasantly_surprised to_see my old friend vimil
vick
working here now
he_took great care_of us
i_love_the location of_this_place
right next_door_to my_favorite gay bar
i_need_to go_back to_try_the_lunch_buffet
if_you_love indian_food_or have_never tried_it
i_highly_recommend_this_place
ask_for vick and he_will help you figure out what_to_order
loved_this_place
we went_to_this_place on_a_saturday_night before a show and can't enough good_things about_this_place
pros
awesome service very funny and down_to earth
fantastic_food
clean restrooms
fast service
and_again
the_food_was terrific
loved_the big screen tv and the_indian music_videos nice_touch
cons
lady welcoming us at_the_front door could_have smiled once or twice
but_no big_deal
would_definitely rinse and repeat
typical liars
i_just went through_a painstaking process of choosing items from_their online menu_for delivery only to_be told
we dont deliver
i_called them on_their lie since_they advertise that_they_do both online and_on their_website
they_even_have an online delivery order tool
i_got pissed
telling them how_much time_i wasted trying_to order vegan for a_big party
they admitted that_they selectively didnt deliver tonight
then hung up_on me
false advertising
they deserve to lose business
wow
found my new_favorite indian_joint
the_food_here_is amazing
i had_dinner and_ordered the_korma chicken_and lets just_say i'm hooked
the_flavor and texture of the_dish_was something i've_never_had before and_i've_been eating_indian_food for_a_while
the_atmosphere_is great open
nice well_stocked bar bollywood playing on several flat screens
i_believe the_owner_is the_bartender a russell peters look a like
lol the_night i_came there_was_a bus load of_indian tourists but the_restaurant_was well planned in_advance
prior_to their arrival i_would_say there_was_a fairly large amount of_indian locals so_you_know the_food_is_good
the free_mango_lassi was_a_great compliment to our_meal
garry our_server is_awesome and_attentive
he's been_there_for years so be_sure to_ask_for him to_get_the best_service
all in_all this_place gets stars and despite_the area it_was_still a safe place_to park and_not worry_about the surrounding area
ok
so_i came_back again and_had deplorable service
the_good food_wasn't good_enough for_the slow
in attentive_and at_times rude staff
not_to_mention a_side_of regular
plain_rice is
food_was_good
but_the_service_was typical_indian
not_the_best
would_definitely_recommend if_you_are close_by and_want_to eat_indian_food
we don't_eat much indian_food
but_this_place was_amazing
our_waiter vick was_excellent_and took very_good care_of us
we let him select our_meals for_us
chicken_tika_masala and the_lamb_rogan_josh
we highly_recommend_this_place
we were_only ones there_at
so_we_had the_place_to ourselves
i_was_craving indian_food_on our_trip so i_found_this on_yelp of_course
the_food_was_excellent
vick was_awesome_and if_i get_back to_vegas
i_will visit_again
awsome food_and best_service
man
i_think_we just beat_the rush
of_us took a_cab over here on_sunday evening for a_quiet
off strip meal
the_yelp_reviews spoke highly of_this_place so why_not
we grabbed our free_mango lassies with_the check_in and_also purchased the for deal as we_sat_down
oddly our_waiter was_a_little cold when he_took our_drinks order but by_the_end_of the_evening he_was all smiles and jokes
the_food portions_were healthy without being obnoxious
though the_place_was largely empty when_we stepped in around
by_the_time_we left
there_were_a good people lined up for_the_buffet
clearly a popular choice
best_indian_restaurant hands down
ask_for gary for star service
vegan_friendly
great_selection_of indian_beers
haywards and flying horse my top picks
great_food
great_service
our_server garry was_extremely helpful with helping us_with the_menu selections
everyone_was friendly
food_was_amazing
i_went_in to_indian palace last_week while_visiting las_vegas_and went_to_this_place all days either for lunch_or_dinner
the_food_was_very authentic
service_was_great
highly_recommend_this_place for folks who like traditional_indian
punjabi
food
i've_eaten here twice
the_first_time was for_the_lunch_buffet_and this_was before_they remodeled
the_food_was_delicious
so_i went again during_dinner
what
a
mess
for_a_place nestled in_a shadier neighborhood
i_didn't_think reservations would_be necessary
when we_came_in
we_were_seated at a_table that still_had remnants and water_glasses from the_last diners
we kept trying to_flag a_server down
but_no one_would even look our_way
i'm_very patient
but_not minutes of no service patient
i_usually give places servers the benefit of_the doubt
but_it_was absolutely ridiculous even_after we flagged someone and they_said someone would_be right with_us
i've never walked out_of_a restaurant due_to bad_service or_even bad_food
but_one can_only wait so_long
if my memory wasn't tarnished by that experience
i'd try_the place_again
otherwise
this_place needs to_be aware_of their diners
i_won't_be going back again
good_food
do_not get rasmalai
i_have_been_to india five times_and love_indian_food
this_place_is fantastic
the_menu_has several things_that are_not usually on_the_menu
vada
dosa
goat dishes_and ground chicken
we_started off_with papadum served_with three fragrant dipping_sauces coriander chutney
chili chutney and_tamarind
i_was already sold
each one_was flavorful_and pungent
we then moved on to_an all_vegetarian meal
the dahi vada
lentil cake with yogurt and_tamarind
were to_die_for moist
with_a thin aromatic sauce
they_are often dry with_a heavy sauce not_here
we also_has malai_kofta
which_was_also delicious
aloo tikka with channa
and bindi masala
okra
i_cannot say_enough good_things
we were_three people and_we had_a_lot_of leftovers to_take_home
our_waiter_was garry and_he_was all smiles and_so appreciative that_we liked_the_food
i_can't_wait_to_go_back
it was_our_first_time at_india_palace and_it_was_a terrific experience
vick was_a_great server with recommendations and very_attentive
we_will_definitely return
this_place_is_a bomb
their_food_is times better_than those hotel buffet costing
it has_a_great collection of legitimate indian_foods ranging_from south to north india
and_we_got a_deal on living_social
for
plus free_mango_lassi on_yelp
what_a dope deal
if_you_want_to save money on food_and party more
this_is_a place_to_go
best indian_food_i've_ever_had
our_waiter vick was_amazing
i_have celiac disease and cannot eat gluten
he_took excellent care_of us
i_wish_i_could bring him and_the_food back_to reno with_me
after watching the movie
life of pi on blu ray
i_was craving_for_indian_food
found_this_place thanks_to groupon
my_friend and_i_decided_to hit up this_place after she_was done drunk shopping at fashion show mall
lol
came around for_dinner
right after we_sat_down
there_was_an influx of_customers for_dinner
whew
got_the orders in and_didn't have_to_wait long
ordered the_following
appetizer combo samosa
aloo_tikki
veggie
chicken_and paneer_pakora
this_was_the_first plate that_came out
duh
it's an_appetizer
it's_pretty decent_and sharing it with_two people is good_enough
i_enjoyed_the samosa_and the paneer_pakora the_most
chicken_tikka_masala_and fish tikka_masala_with plain basmati_rice
ok
so the_entree is_where my_heart somewhat melts
got them both at medium_spicy
it_was_too much gravy yyy and not_enough meat
meat gravy ratio
bottom_line
i_would hit up this_place_again
but_would try_the_lunch_buffet
because the_groupon wasn't allowed to_use for_lunch_buffet
we_went_for normal entree menus
and glad_we did
items selected
masala_dosa
thin crispy rice crepes filled_with deliciously spiced potatoes onions
chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori white chicken marinated_in yogurt spices
simmered in_a creamy tomato sauce
mango_lassi
check_in bonus
for dosa
my all_time favorite has_been http
www
dosasf
com in sf
but india_palace does it_in a_different way
more crispy_and lighter
which was_really_good
chicken_tikka_masala was_also_very_good
and_the_naan_was tasty
for basic items
execution is everything_and they_did quite well
fresh_and_hot
no stale leftovers we_usually see in lunch_buffet were observed
i'll return_for the_dosa
lunch_buffet_was decent_but i_know three other_indian_restaurants within a_mile that_have food_that is_better_than anything i_ate_here
great_service_and delicious_food
definitely_will be_back_for_more of_that vegetarian_dinner special and_garlic_naan
love coming_here one_of_my_favorite indian_restaurants_in_las_vegas
everytime i've come_here i've_had excellent_service
gary has_been out server the_past several_times and_he always makes our time enjoyable
hands down this food_is_amazing
i_love atmosphere here as_well
very refreshing
worth_the_drive from summerlin each time
i'll be continuing to_come_here when_i crave authentic_indian_food
this_was such tasty punjabi food
i_just loved_it
we_were visiting with family from_india and even_if my_taste_buds have changed a_lot living here
they_said this_was_the_best that_they_have seen so_far
the_place got really crowded soon after we_were_seated that did_not frazzle them a_bit
service_was_awesome
food_arrived in_no time_and in_all one_of_my best experiences for_indian_food_in a_place filled_with visitors
can't_wait_to go_back
decided_to_go vegetarian with couple_of friends and_ordered malai_kofta
matter_paneer
baigan bhartha and all_three items were_excellent
the_bread basket was_great value_and nans were_perfect
service by garry was_awesome
we_will_be_back soon
we_went_in with_little expectations
food was_absolutely_delicious
we tried_the_buffet
the spread was generous_and at_a pretty affordable pre tax
would_highly_recommend paneer saag and_the masala_chai
my jam
we've been_coming to_india_palace for the_past years
and though we've tried two_other indian_restaurants_in_town closer_to where_we live
we_always come_back_and make that minute drive because it_is_the_best
service wise
meaning the
friendliness
of the_servers
is hit_or_miss
but_that_is me being nit picky
they_always bring_us what_we need
we_never have_to_wait for drink or_naan refills
and_i come_for_the food not_the the smiles
i recommend_this_place_to everyone i_know
we purchased a living_social deal_for credit on a_recent trip_to_vegas i gotta say
i_would_definitely_go back even without the_deal
pros
the_food
reasonably_priced
these were_more_than enough for_two_people
we had_leftovers ordered extra naan_for later
lamb_rogan_josh
plain basmati_rice
chicken_tikka_masala
garlic_naan
their free_mango drink when_you check_in is soooo goood
cons
nothing really
just the_service_was a_little_slow
they_had_a private party going_on in another room
but our_server
garry
was_great
basically
worth checking_out
bomb indian_food
entertaining music_videos on tv
friendly_staff
don't_let_the sketchy area keep you away
the_food pisses amazing
i've been twice and_had_the goat_curry both_times
i_actually stabbed my_dinner partner in_the hand when_he reached for a_bite
the_cheese bread is_so_good and is_perfect with the_green mint sauce
the_staff_is excellent at describing the_dishes and both_times they_have brought_me samples from_the_kitchen at no charge
i_would_have given stars_if not_for_the fact i_found hair in_my goat the_last_time_i visited
it ended the_meal
i but_i_will likely be_back_for_more
i'll just hope there_are hairnets back in_the_kitchen
this_restaurant
in_a_small shopping plaza
features the_cuisine of_both india_and nepal
we_shared traditional nepalese entrees of chili_chicken and_meat momo as recommended_by max jacobsen
the waiter_asked how_spicy would we_like our chili_chicken indian spicy was_my reply
wow call_the fire department we_are talking smoking hot
each order of_meat momo order includes momos
i_love that word
which_are steamed dumplings stuffed_with ground turkey and_vegetables
we_also ordered_naan
mango_lassis
yogurt based beverages
and_desserts
khir and lal mohan
the former is basmati_rice in milk with raisins_and nuts and the_latter is similar_to or the_same_as gulab_jamun
but a_bit denser
good restaurant_with mediocre at best_service and_decor
the_food_was_good
a mixure of_indian_and nepalese_food
the_curries_were quite_tasty and naan_was_great
however
i_was_expecting more nepalese and himalayan food_and less more traditional indian_food fare
however
all in_all cuisine aspect of_the_place is_definitely above_average
service_was poor
we_came_in for an_early dinner
around_pm
and_the_place_was empty
a_few nepalese gentleman
friends of the_owner
i presume
were sitting together talking business_and writing stuff on notepad right in_front_of_the customers not professional
that would_have_been okay
but to_top_it off
one_of_the managers
or possibly the_owner_was also serving the_tables and was_quite slow with water drink refills and_was_very rude in questions about different
unfamiliar menu_items
he even_had a smirk on_his face a_couple_of_times
the tables_were unimpressive and_some_of_the booths were ripped in places_and patched together with tape
overall
for_me_to return to_this_place
i_would_have to_make_sure that the_server manager_was not there_that day_and that_it_was busier so_i do_not_have to_see creepy business conversations
but
i_may come_back_and recommend_this_place for unique_and tasty_food
good_food_and a surprisingly sophisticated beer_and_wine menu
have_yet_to have_something there that_wasn't delicious
hit the_lunch_buffet_for a nice_selection of_what they_have to_offer or order_off_the descriptive
and slightly humorously written
menu
if_you_like it hot
and i_mean hot
this_is_one_of_the few_places i_have_been_to in_a_while that_will make_it hot enough_for me
don't_be afraid_to say so
they_will accommodate you
however
if_they suggest a heat_level for_a dish
my experiences there_are to listen to_them and enjoy_the subtle nuances that too_much spicy might cover
you_can always ask for_something spicy on_the side if_you_want_to heat it_up
be_sure_to check what_the specials_are
often unique_and tasty
good_variety and a_place_that can accommodate your vegan_and vegetarian friends
as_well
head there_for happy_hour
can't remember the_exact time
and_enjoy the_two for_one beer prices
they_have_a diverse selection from around_the_world
including some_great belgian style ales as_well_as_a couple_of organic brews
or try_the ginger energy tea
just the_thing to_pick you_up
edit
the_place in under new_management
wasn't happy w the_food or service the_last_time_i was_there
hard_to get them to_make_it hot nemore
i_know they_have_a different chef than when_i gave my_first review
will_give it_another shot
but it_isn't the_same place as_it_was
edit
went again last friday
food_was lackluster
not_bad
but not_at_all what_it_was
sad that_the place_that used_to have awesome flavor_and spice served me two bland entrees
would drop it_to two_stars if_it didn't_have a_decent price
and_one_of my_friends did like one_of_the two_things she got
edit
they're back
very_happy to_say_that the food_has_been really_good the_past couple_of_times i_have_been there
and the_lunch_buffet_is still_good and_reasonably_priced
thumbs_up
went_to_the lunch_buffet_here and_everything_was pretty forgettable
i_agree_with everything carly said
except_for_the cute waiter part
no point in coming_back_here when_there so_many better indian_lunch_buffets
i_enjoyed dinner_here a_lot the_service_was outstanding with_lots_of suggestions and guidance
i_ordered_the mango_chicken
how_spicy on_a_scale of to
asked our_waiter
being_a volcano and being_a babbling brook
i ummm and_then ordered
that_was_a modestly spicy curry_with a_sweet tang to_it just_as promised
the stuffed paratha has_some potato_and peas
but_not enough_for my_indian colleague's liking
this_place_is also a_hidden_gem for beer
the_beer menu_is_extensive
but_there_were also an_additional beers recently added
take_a look before you_choose
said our_waiter as_he pointed to_the_table with beer bottles on
so_i did
and came_back with_a pint bottle_of belgian lager
very_nice with_my mango_chicken
try_this_place
i_didn't try_the_buffet
all in_all
the_portions_are good my colleague and_i_shared the_curry and_rice and_we_had paratha each
i_had_a beer too and_the bill_was incl tip
the_decor isn't as nice as the_nepalese place_in pasadena
ca
but_it's pleasant enough
our taxi driver didn't know the_name_of this_place but he'd seen it
but
considering vegas isn't necessarily a_place of culture it's no bad_thing if himalayan is_a_little obscure and off_the beaten track
i_love_indian_food
it_has by far surpassed mexican_food on_my list_of food i_could_eat daily
unfortunately my_boyfriend
who i spend the majority_of my time_with
does not feel the_same
in_fact
he specifically asks that_we do_not_have indian_food when_i_am choosing the_restaurant
so consider my complete elation when he_suggested i_look up an indian_food_restaurant to_go_to while_visiting las_vegas
after_looking online
not on_yelp
for_some_reason
i decided_on himalayan cuisine
and jesus were we happy
they_took reservations
i_appreciate this because very few restaurants_in sacramento do
it_is off_the_strip
look
dining on_the_strip is typically expensive
annoying and tasteless
i_was_hoping that_this_place would_be where_the locals go and_it_was
the_food_was_fantastic
my_boyfriend loved his dish
the_waiter and_the_owner both suggested fantastic wine_and appetizers_and my_dish was_spicy_and delicious
the_coconut dessert is absolute heaven
and i_don't_like coconut
the_owner_is amazing
not_only was he friendly and_took his time recommending wine to_us
he_brought us_out a sample of_his favorite wine_and even toasted with_us
by_the_end_of the_evening we_were inviting him to_the double down_for a_drink
this_place_was absolutely wonderful
we_left with full bellies
lucky beer_and a_special discount on_our next bill
oh yes
we_will_be_back
update
new decor
bigger restaurant
same fabulous beer menu
same silly menu
but the_name has changed and_there's now a_lunch_buffet
sadly
the_new lunch_buffet_is almost_all indian_food_with little himalayan or nepalese
but
this_is_one_of_the_best indian_restaurants_in_vegas
and_i'd even put_it up_there with some_of_the_best_indian_food in_the san_francisco bay_area
this ain't your_typical greasy indian_buffet
the_food_is_fresh_and delicious
this_is_one_of_the_best budget restaurants_in_town and_my old review gave them stars
but_i'm adding another star_for_the new
beautiful decor
old review
why go_to_a himalayan restaurant and_get indian_food
maybe it's because this_place_has been under new ownership for_about months but_at least half the_menu_is nepalese himalayan food
yes
there_is indian_food on_the_menu
but_i_didn't eat any_of it_and you_don't_have to either unless you_want_to
there_is no lunch_buffet anymore
we_had_the nepalese sampler platter
split one between two_of_us which_was plenty of_food_for a not heavy dinner
and it_was_wonderful
the_only_thing_that looked even remotely indian was the_dessert
we_had some_kind_of black eyed pea dhal ish kind of thing_that_was a_bit bland but_still nourishing and_tasty
a cucumber
potato
cilantro salad was_one_of_the tastiest things i've ever_eaten
the_lamb_was scrumptious
i'm_not huge on chicken but it_was_pretty_good
there_was some_kind_of bamboo shoot salad that_was oddly compelling
no clue what_was in_it
and_the momo
oh man it_is all_about_the momo
i_could_eat these tasty dumplings all_day long
phenomenal beer_selection
friendly owner
great_food
if_you_like spice
don't ask_for
the was_really quite mild
rarely do_i find myself in gastrointestinal distress
but_after a gigantic four course dinner the_night before with_many glasses_of booze and servings of_meat the_size_of my_head
my poor tum was crying uncle and_all i_wanted was something fibrous and unadulterated by animal products
i'm a_bit biased because i_know_the owner of_the joint
but_i_don't_think he_would have served me any less of a_fantastic meal had i been some schmo off_the_strip
i_ate a gingered daal
smoky green beans and_potatoes
chickpeas and_spinach
and cauliflower in_a yogurt_sauce accompanied by_a mango_lassi_and was_perfectly happy
although i_am_not_a big drinker
rajan loves his alcomohol and keeps fabulous and strange beverages for_your pleasure
of_both the brew and grape variety
heck
if_i'm not_going_to drink it
you_may as_well
but hands off that dessert wine
visited vegas this week with my_boyfriend_and his coworkers and_it_was our pleasure to_take them to_this_place
again
fantastic_service
great_food_and fully bellies
the_waiter had us all laughing and talking and_the_food had us_in a_bit_of_a coma
thank_you thank_you and_we_will be_back_again
this_is_my_favorite_indian place_in_town
their_food_is very_tasty_and well_spiced and_the naan_bread_is hot_and crisp
the_service_is attentive
unfortunately they_don't_have the_lunch_buffet anymore
the_food_was_not exceptional
just good solid vegetarian indian_food_but wait
the tibetan food_was_really_good
and i_hadn't seen a_lot_of it_before
the_sauces_were a_little underspiced
and the_vegetables a_little not varied enough
but_i_still definitely_recommend_this_place
its menu_has a_lot_of attitude and wonderfully designates all_the_dishes which can_be made vegan i_really appreciated this
the_only really downside of_the dinner_was the_owner
who_was chatty to_an extreme as_we_were trying_to leave
i_recommend_the channa_masala and_the tibetan dish similar_to yakisoba
i_like this_place_and dine there frequently
it's almost always quiet_and empty
which_i like
the_menu_is cleverly written and_the_food has_never disappointed me
try_the makhani
service can_be_a_little uneven
sometimes they_will bring dishes without serving spoons
or present a shared appetizer without plates so_you have_to_ask for_them
at_times i've_had to_flag them down to_get_the check
sometimes the_kitchen is_a_little odd
the_menu says the tomato_soup has paneer
but_i recently ordered_it and_it_came without_it
so_i_had them redo it
i_was_there again last_week and as_i_was ordering the_soup i_asked about_this
and_had_to point to the_menu where_it says the_soup has paneer
no really
it says paneer
i_like paneer
bring_it to_me with the_paneer
i_am_a little worried about_them
however
they_used_to have the_biggest beer_list in_las_vegas
but_now if_you_want_to order beer
they_are out_of stock of almost everything_on_the list
they point you_to a_table where you_can look_at what_is available
and_i'd guess there_are less than ten selections
not_a_good sign_that they_are_not sticking to_the brand promise of an_amazing beer_list
times are tough i_guess
and_no_one wants_to order expensive inventory that is_going_to sit
let's get right into_this
the_service_is adequate
i_haven't really tried napalese food
but i_thought_it_was okay
the_place looked comfortable
the_server was_a_bit_slow at_times even though there_were hardly any people
i_also_tried a_few_of the_indian_food
and_it_was also decent
i've_only tried_this_place in_las_vegas_for indian_food
but_i_don't_think it's up_there compared_to_other_indian food_i've_had_in other states
however
it_was_ok even_though_i think the_prices could_be better
this_is_a wonderful place for_vegetarians
and_all_the more so since vegetarians don't_get too_many great options in_las_vegas
the_food_is varied
delicious
and healthy
the prices_are_pretty reasonable for_the high quality_of_food
for visitors
i'll start by saying that_this_is slightly over a_mile off_the_strip
so in_most weather you'll need_to drive
however my_wife_and_i walked down from bellagio on new year's day and_the weather was_perfect
both sunny and cool
and_it_was about_minutes walk_in each direction
note that this_food_is nepali food
not_indian
if_you_go expecting it to_taste exactly like_indian
you'll be_disappointed
as an_indian from silicon valley
i'll say_that_i like nepali food a_lot
because it_has more delicate spices_and seasonings
it's a_whole lot less oily
and it's_hard_to find around where i_live
in particular
i_like the_food_here better than_what_i get_in most_indian_restaurants in_my area
even_the popular ones
we_tried_the vegan sampler platter for_two
and were_not_disappointed
there_was_a mixed bean and lentil_soup called kwati that had_a delightful smoky flavor
there_were_a_few other curries including_a garbanzo spinach combination and_a potato cauliflower combination
each had its own different flavor and_all_the ingredients tasted fresh
loved_it
all_this came_on a_plate with whole_wheat bread_and rice
we_also_had samosas as appetizers
and_they_were good_though not spectacular like the_rest
we_had hot tea
a_tasty organic variety
rather than wine
but next_time i'm_going to_try_something from_the intriguing wine_list
we_left happy_and well filled
though not heavy because the_food_was_not rich
of_course
your mileage may vary
and you_might find_it bland
also i_can't comment on_the non vegetarian_food
we intentionally ordered our_food mild because we_wanted_to taste_the seasoning and_spices
and_it_was a_good_choice for_us
you_can_order it_spicy if_you_like your chilies
overall
i enthusiastically recommend_this_restaurant for_vegetarians visiting las_vegas
and meat_eaters can_try it_too if_they get tired of_the steakhouses and_the seafood buffets
it's_a_great pity i_only found it_on_the last day_of our_trip
otherwise i'd_have skipped one_of_the buffets_and eaten_here twice
it_was_excellent
i_was_a_little embarassed because_i couldn't remember_what the_yogurt drink i_like was_called
lassi
and_couldn't find_it on_the_menu
but_they new what_i_was talking about_and brought_it right away
it_was_all fabulous
we_will_definitely return
i_went_here with_my uncle and_his girlfriend when_they visited from california
my uncle liked the_weekend thali special because_it included_a complimentary glass_of champagne
his girlfriend liked_it because_it_was all_you_can_eat
i_liked_it because even the_thali special wasn't_bad
one_of_the_dishes
the lentil_soup
left a_great_deal to_be_desired
but everything_else_was fresh_and_tasty
when the_lunch_special is mostly good and_nothing makes_you shudder
then_the regular_menu is_usually superb
i_also_like that_they_do a_lunch wallah card delivery service to unlv
i_might consider it next semester
went to_this_restaurant because my_brother saw a_lot_of
recession special
ads on billboards and_since he_was craving_for_indian_food
we_ended_up going_there for_his birthday brunch
presentation_was good
portions_were on_the
smaller
side but then_again
majority_of indian_food comes that size
we_had_the lamb kurma
tandori_chicken
and several folks in my_party had_the
all_you_can_eat
the_place_was_packed for a_saturday afternoon and there_was_only poor waiter running around pouring water
taking orders
cleaning tables
and_he_was probably the_cook too 'cause we_waited and_waited and_waited for_our_food
not_being too
graphic
hours after brunch
i_wasn't feeling too great
later that_day when_i told my_brother
he said
oh
i_forgot to_tell you_that last_week when we_tried to_come for_lunch
the_health department shut it_down due_to some
pipes issues
supposedly
nice
bro
happy
bday
the_best_indian_restaurant ive been_to
i_am not_a_big_fan_of indian_food
this_is_the_only indian_restaurant_i ever enjoy
ive been_to different indian_restaurant_and do_not like_indian_food
if_your a_vegetarian
this_is_the_place and_it_is awesome for_you
i_am_not
i did_enjoy there yellow curry_and clossal shrimp_dish
the_price_is fair
lunch deal is_excellent
the_service_is_friendly and_have excellent selection_of beer_and_wine
great food_at_a good_price
in_las_vegas this_is_not easy_to find
this_is_not generic indian_food
the_menu_is varied
creative and_will please both vegetarians_and carnivores
the_service_was_friendly and_good
the_restaurant_is being remodeled and_said it_will have_a lassi bar
walking miles in_las_vegas in degree weather may_have not_been such_a_great idea but walking to himalayan cuisine was
since_i didn't_want_to have indian_food_that i_could_eat anywhere else
i_opted to_try_something from tibet or nepal
since their lunch_specials were mostly indian
i_ordered from_the_menu
the tibetan nepalese section was_rather sparse in_comparison to_the_indian section and chose one of_two vegan_options
i_ordered_the chau_chau which_was_a flavorful blend_of noodles and_vegetables with chili paste
the_dish_was pretty_good though_i wish there_was more variety than_just noodles and_was happy_that i_chose the_half order which_was sufficient enough to_fill my_stomach and left_me craving for_dessert
the_half order_was similarly priced as the_lunch_special
they_offered one vegan dessert option which was_absolutely_amazing
i_tried_the gajar haluwa which_is_a carrot
pudding
that consisted_of carrots chopped up very_small and sweetened by_its own juices mixed_with raisins
apparently nuts were_also in_the
pudding
though_i didn't_see any
their red tea peach iced_tea was_also delicately sweetened and_refreshing for_the hot weather
the_atmosphere_is alright
it_is a_lot_more casual than it_looks on their_website
their right wall is under construction pending a lassi bar_and they_use paper napkins instead_of fancy napkins
i_can_only hope that the_lassi bar will include some non dairy options
i_just love_the_food here
for_the time being i honestly think this_is_the_best place_to_get indian himalayan food_in_town
they_are doing some big renovations right at_this moment but_when it's done they_will have their_lunch_buffet open
i_think_it will_be pretty_nice on_the_inside once they finish
but_for now you_have_to deal_with the black tarp that divides the_place up
i_have_eaten there two_times in_the_last week and_a hand full_of times a_year or_so ago
i_will_say the_food_is much better this time_around
i_brought my_family_and we_tried several dishes_and everything_was_great
i_ate there_again yesterday and_still consistently great
oh almost forgot
they_offer a_good_amount_of vegan_options and organic ingredients
half_of my_family are vegans
the_food_and service_is_great here
it's much fancier than_the older version
looks like they're revamping the_interior
but_i_was most floored when i_saw_the words
vegan
and
organic
on menu_items
i_had_to do_a double take
and was_pretty skeptical while awaiting my_dish but was_pleasantly_surprised the food_was_fresh
not too_salty
perfectly seasoned
oh_yeah
it's about_indian i recommend_this_place for_indian_food too
ps
try_the rose balls
don't_remember the_actual name on_the_menu
they_are the donuts thingys flavored with rose water
i've tried these many_times in different cities but these_are hands_down_the most delectable
this_place_is so_good
the_best place_to_get indian_food_in_las_vegas and_the_food_is slightly cheaper than other_indian_places
and_get this
you_get the_rice for_free
omg
what your not gonna charge me ten dollars for basic white_rice which
is_almost should be_an inalienable right like freedom
the makhani with vegetables is_delicious
malia kofta is creamy
and not_to rich_and the kofta balls are_nice and_fresh
the_saag tastes super fresh
not_like canned spinach
the beers are on_the pricey side but
i_tried_the kingfisher beer_and enjoyed_it immensely
i_got_a mango_lassi for_dessert and_it_was_delicious
the_food_is_good here
got_the
lsd
which_is lamb_in some spicy_sauce
sorry not_an_indian nepalese_food expert
and_i_believe there_is_a hint_of curry
it_was served_with something reminiscent_of grits and_a green leafy vegetable
i_tried_the mango drink
surprisingly_good
i_definitely liked how low key it_is and the_server_was polite
i went_to_this_place last_week with my_sister and_two other_people who_have never_tried_indian_food
and_we_all loved_it
we_had_the indian_sampler for and_the vertical vindaloo and_it_was all_delicious
the_sampler
one_other entree and extra order_of_naan was enough_for the_of_us
the_service_was_also great
i_definitely would_recommend_this_place to_anyone_who wanted to_try_indian or_even just something different
how wonderful to find_this_place off rainbow
chris
the_owner
who is_always working
is_wonderful
and_makes a_point to great all guests
and visit the_tables to_say hello and_make you_feel appreciated
inside decor is_still being worked on
but even_in mid decoration
it's_a_nice atmosphere
great beer_list with good_prices
try_the pirate with an_amazing flavour you definitely get_your money's worth on that_one
everything we_tried there_was wonderful
the chau_chau
sp
chicken
the_lamb_vindaloo
chicken_biryani
chicken chili
naan
mango_ice_cream
fabulous
and the_yogurt topping is_fantastic a_definite must with_the spicy_dishes
servings are_well presented
all come_with superb rice
and generous portions
great_service
wonderful_food
and decent prices
entrees ranged from
and the_lunch_buffet_is a_steal for
mmmmm
i only_wish i_lived closer
or
even_better
that chris will open up a_mint in_san diego
having recently been burned by overpriced terrible tasting_food at another_indian_restaurant in_the_area cough bollywood cough we_were hesitant to_try_more indian_cuisine
we_were having_a tough time coming up_with_a new_place to_visit so i_went_to yelp
i_started looking up various ethnic cuisines and_i did_a search_for nepalese_food
much to_my_surprise a_place called mint_indian_bistro showed up
after_reading_the reviews it_seemed_like the_place had a_mix_of himalayan and northern indian_cuisine
so_we made_a resolution
we'll try_some appetizers_and if we_didn't like_it we_would go_to_a different restaurant for_our_main meal
all_that plan b contingency stuff went out the_window when_i looked at_the_menu
they_actually had menu_items marked as vegan_and vegetarian such that_for once i_would_not have_to_ask about the_ingredients they_use in each of_the_dishes
so_we made_the plunge
we_decided_to share the_vegan sampler and it_was_good
i_want_to say_it_was great
but_there_were a_couple_of items_in the_sampler that i_did_not enjoy as_much as the_rest
additionally the_decor_and feel of_the_restaurant was_very_nice
they_even turned the lights up for_us temporarily while_we_were perusing the_menu so_my mother could_see the menus as_she squinted without her reading glasses again
with full disclosure and all_that jazz i_would_say the_food_was in_the four star range
but_the addition of_the vegan_friendly menu really pushes the rating up for_me into_the five_star range
i gotta help promote any vegan_friendly place here_in_vegas because_they_are not_as prevalent as they_are in_other towns
nice_and casual
foods are_not super salty_and greasy
kids friendly_too
great_quality food
much better_than when_it_was himilayan cuisine
love_that we_got_a free good_quality mimosa w our weekend_buffet
price not unreasonable
food_was_amazing
delicious chicken_pakora
like_indian chicken fingers
chicken_tikka_masala
tamarind rice and_spinach w chickpeas
my_husband is vegan_and there_were_some nice options_for him too
will_go_back again soon
i_have_been coming_here since
before it_was named mint_bistro
it_was called himilayan napalese cuisine
they_used_to not have_a_lunch_buffet
the_lunch_buffet_is great
i_go_to unlv and i_used_to come_here often for_lunch
the_owners_are really_nice
they food_is_really flavorful
they try to_change the_entrees up as often as possible
there_is always chicken_tandoori
and kheer
which_is all_that i_need_to make_me happy
sometimes they_have saag
and_it's so_delicious
the_music is_nice_and the_ambiance_is very_pleasant
they_have vegan_and vegetarian_dishes_and an assortment_of appetizers that go really_well with mint_chutney
they_also have fresh fruit and salad
it_is well_worth_the
this_place serves halal meats which_is_a plus if_you_are looking_for_a zabihah restaurant
the chikken tikka_masala
chicken_tandoori
and_lamb_vindaloo were_all_very good_as was_the_naan
bhaji
and_yogurt
kheer
indian rice_pudding
was_also_very_good
the_indian dishes_that we_tried were among some_of_the_best_indian items we_had tried
i_recommend_the indian_dinner plate special
which_is and contains about or items to_be shared with another person
every_time_i visit las_vegas i_must without fail eat_at mint_indian_bistro
because i_believe it's_one_of the_best_indian_restaurants_in the_country
i say_this after having sampled the_vegetarian food_selection at over_a hundred indian_restaurants_in about a_dozen major cities over the_past two decades
the diversity
freshness
and flavor_of_the nepali indian vegetarian_food at_mint is unmatched
i_usually order_the lumbini platter
which_is vegan
this_is_not cheap at and others may simply wish to_try_the_lunch_buffet instead
but for_those willing to_try_the vegan platter
let me say_that it's health food_that tastes_like gourmet food
the_meal comes with_rice
whole_wheat roti
a_mixed lentil daal with_a tantalizing smoky flavor
a_few_different vegetable combinations each with_their own unique flavor
and_a carrot pudding for_dessert
on my_last_visit chris
the_owner
who_has become a_friend_of_mine
recommended i try_the soy mango_lassi afterward
and_being in_an adventurous mood i_tried_it and_was_very happy_with_the result
what makes the_food_at mint so different is_that_the flavors of_all_the ingredients come_out in_a delightful blend and dance on_your palate
because unlike most_indian_restaurants
the_chef here_is sparing with the_chili powder
uses oil in carefully controlled amounts
and uses different spice combinations in each_dish
as a_result you_eat to_your heart's content
enjoy every_bite
remember_the delicious curries mom cooked at_home
if you're from_india
and end_up feeling_like you've done your body a_favor with all_that nutrition
this restraunt provided a less than mediocre expereience on new year eve
there_were long hairs in_the noodles and the_desert smelt like days old
donot get_there and_be cheated
i'm_not aware_of better_indian restaurant's
but certainly this_one_is hopeless
not_much to_say here_i liked_the_food
which_was tasty and_reasonably_priced
service_was_very slow
however
it_took about_minutes to receive our_order quite surprising since_there were only_two other_tables occupied
and_it_was only
pm
bottom_line
if_you're_in a_hurry
go elsewhere
if_not
stay and_enjoy
the five star_rating is for_dinner
i_would drop a_star for_lunch
the_dinner was perfectly_cooked
we_had_a combination of_indian_and nepalese dishes
amazing shrimp_dish
service_was_excellent
fast enough
for_indian_food
and customized for_my needs
extremely spicy
the_lunch_buffet on_the_other_hand was very_mild and_some even bland with_a_lot_of sweet options
which i_guess is to_be expected with_the audience for_the_lunch_buffet but_i and_my_wife was_not super happy at_lunch
this_is_a good option if_you_are_in vegas with_a car and would_like_to get away_from_the crazy buffets_and try_some real food
there's two kinds_of indian_food
the greasy comfort variety or_the savory
authentic kind
as this_place also serves himalayan dishes
one will_find the_food_here_is quite pleasantly the_non greasy
delicious kind
and_if vegetarian_and_vegan dishes_are your thing
it_will_be even_better
all_the items_on_the_menu are clearly marked and the_waiters are_very receptive to questions
the_pakora and_the paratha is so_tasty
as_well_as_the chau_chau
also
there_is_a great_variety of beers
all_the good_things everyone has said are true
it's_not on_the_strip
which_is_great
since_it means it's_not ridiculously crowded
the_lassi bar is_a_great innovation
and_the thandai lassi_with vodka is_awesome
we_asked_for all_our dishes extra_spicy
but while_they were_pretty great
they_weren't spicy_at_all
i've known this_to happen before to_some_of my_friends at_indian_restaurants when the_server makes a size you_up decision that you_can't handle it
but_really
this_time they should_have concluded that we_can
given_a
we_were indian
b
we kept repeating about_how much we_loved spicy_food
oh_well
minor nitpick aside
the food_is_pretty great
especially some_of_the nepalese dishes
which are_pretty rare
i've_only been_able_to find one restaurant_in chicago
if_i ever decide that going down_on vegas junkets to behave outrageously and pretend you're exempt from_all rules becomes a_regular habit
mint will_be_a regular lunch spot too
my_bf and_i_were looking_for_a place a_tad more upscale than getting_the concierge service at_the penny slots at el cortez and yelp led us_to a_veggie friendly eating place_with a_touch of class the was_not on_the godforsaken strip
we_both love_indian_food
so mint seemed_like the_right choice
i_was first pleased to_see_that we_were_the_only folks there_that didn't appear to_be of_indian ancestry
my_personal good_sign indicator for ethnic fooderies
i_was also pleased to_see_that it_was_pretty packed
but_there_was no wait to_be_seated
the_decor_was simple_and elegant
with_lots_of blond wood and high backed booths
service_was spectacular
we_had at least very_attentive_and polite servers
they_kept us up_to date on_the progress of_each course
made_sure our_water was_cold and plentiful
and inquired about_our enjoyment
the_menu_was extensive
with_both himyl and indian_dishes
there_was a_lot_of creativity involved
but the_old standbys were_also delish
i_also liked_that the_menu let diners know what_was veggie vegan_friendly
say yes to the_samosas my_friends
they_are the_best_i_have_had
all dishes_were at a_fair price
and_i_really liked_that you_could order half dishes at_a reduced cost
this_was especially important when_you have_no microwave in_your hotel
and you_were taught not_to waste food
me_and the_bf were_really pleased with our_dishes
and_two half plate entrees were_more_than enough_food to_share and_be stuffed but_not_too stuffed due_to_the half portions
i_may also have_to mention_that they_serve frambois
and_i_would cut someone_to have_that delicious fizzy nectar
this_is_the_place that inspired me_to yelp
i_knew after seeing a_yelp approved sticker in the_window
that these reviews actually make an impact
yelpers
you_got gooooood taste
so
thank_you fellow yelpers on leading us here
and thanks mint for_being so rad
i ordered_take_out from_here not too_long ago and_i_will never_go_back
i_don't_know who does the cooking but they_need to_stop immediately
we_ordered_the_chicken kadhai
vertical vindaloo
with_chicken
and boneless lamb kabobs
the chicken_dishes were_both excessively oily and god only knows what part_of_the chicken they_used
i specifically asked_for breast meat_and that_i_would even pay a_few extra_for it
the_guy said_no problem
i_came home_and opened the containers and_saw this dark
muscle ridden meat sitting in_front_of me
both chicken_dishes looked exactly the_same even though they're supposedly different styles
the kabobs were horrible
huge pieces_of lamb that_were nowhere near tender
to_top_it all off
it_was for dishes
some naan_and_rice
i_will_never visit_this_place again
i can_make better indian_dishes at_home
excellent_food
attention_to detail
service_and beer_list
wow
we wish mint was in_our home town
the_menu was_fantastic_and caters to_all diets
we_loved our_visit to_mint
i_went_here a_few_days ago because_it's like miles away from my_house
this_place_has been a_few_different restaurants_in_the few years i've_lived on this_side_of_town
it_was_a himalayan restaurant
and_now it's indian_restaurant
the_decor inside_is very basic
moss green walls
some black iron pieces on the_walls but_was largely devoid of cultural ambiance that i_particularly like in ethnic restaurants
i_feel_like decor really adds to_an experience
it makes_it feel authentic
this_place didn't_really have_that
it_was new
so_maybe that's why it_was_so sparsely decorated
i_took someone here because_they never_tried_indian before
so_we just ordered the_indian_sampler
the_indian_sampler had_about pint sized versions of coconut curry vegetables
lamb_vindaloo
chicken_masala
lentils
tandoori_chicken
yoghurt
kheer
and one_other that i_can't_remember
it_was accompanied by pieces_of sliced garlic_naan and_basmati_rice
the_coconut curry veggies were_fantastic
the_flavors_were excellent
the_lamb_vindaloo was_good
not_great
not_as spicy_as i'm_used_to
but not_bad
the_tandoori_chicken was_kind_of a joke
it_looked_like two cornish game hen legs
so micro chicken legs
i_thought_that looked horrible
we_ordered lychee lassi and_mango_lassi
and_for whatever reason_i was_served lukewarm mango_lassi
i've never received lassi that_wasn't cold
so it_was_a_little different for_me since_the lychee lassi was_served over ice
the_service_was_good
no_complaints on_that
the_owner chatted with_us a_little and was_friendly
all in_all
it_was okay
it_wasn't great
the_price points are lower than origin india
so i'd_go back_if i_wanted_to pay something a_little_more moderate
the_experience was fun
nothing mind blowing
origin india just blows it out_of_the water as far_as the_quality_of_the_food and_ambiance though
so i'd much rather_go there if_i_had a_choice
after_a_long day at_a convention at the_las_vegas convention center
my_husband_and_i we looking_for_a nearby restaurant off_the_strip
we_needed to decompress from an excited
yet stressful day
fortunately
we_found mint_indian_bistro
a_mile south of_the lvcc
we_shared_the indian_sampler
around
which_was incredibly flavorful_and delicious
our friendly servers
rajeev and biru
who_are from nepal
gave_us_a lesson on_the similarities and differences between nepalese and_indian cuisines
something we_found intriguing
when we're traveling
we typically like_to try_different restaurants during_our stay
however
we_made an exception and_came back_to_try mint_indian bistro's all_you_can_eat buffet the_next_day
rajeev's and biru's hospitality coupled with_the_food we_enjoyed made that an easy choice
when_i return_to vegas
i'll definitely come_back_to mint_indian_bistro
lunch_special buffet_for
hell yes
best_indian_lunch_buffet around
with dishes also set out_for vegetarians_and vegans
it is_a_little smaller than_most buffets i_have_been_to
but_there_is still a_great_selection
i_got_the_chicken tandoori and_tikka_masala
tried a_bit_of the_goat_curry
and_pretty much ate up the_vegetarian half of_the_buffet as_well
overall
an_excellent steal for_the_price
the standout for me_was_the kheer
it was_some_of_the best i_had
i_also_tried a mango_custard which_was_delicious
i_would_say it's a_must if_you_are_in_the area or would_like some_indian for_lunch
i_work across_the_street from mint
so_it_is our go_to lunch place_for vegans
vegetarians
and meatavores
however
reading the_other_reviews
i really_need to_check_it_out for_dinner sometime
i'm quite pleased with their_buffet because a
it_is cheaper than_most at only
b
it_has lots_of clearly marked vegan_options
and c
unlv dri employees get off
yay
cheaper
more stuff
plus a_discount
sold
we go_there so_much_that the_staff puts in_a order_of vegan roti for_me as_soon_as_we walk_in the_door
which_is sweet
the_service_is usually very_attentive
filling drinks
etc
apparently they_will even make vegans a_special version_of the_vegetarian_dishes on_the_buffet if_you_ask
i_never even thought to_try_this until i_saw some_other vegan customers do_it
between_the kwaati
deliciously spiced bean soup
mixed veggie pakoras
chau_chau
nepalese noodle dish
two kinds_of rice
daal
and usually vegan entrees
i_was never_really hurting for options
they_also_have_a great beer_selection that i_never get_to_try since_i go at_lunch
going to_make_a dinner trip there_a priority
one_of_the_best_indian food experiences i've ever_had
we_started_with_the veggie momo
dumplings
based_on_the level_of saltiness i'm pretty_sure they_came out_of_a package but_i appreciated they_were steamed and_not fried
the_chutney that_came_with them for_dipping certainly upstaged their flaws as did_the courses to follow
we_ordered a_couple_different variations on naan
bread
and_they_were hot_and delicious
obviously right out_of_the oven
i_ordered_the_chicken curry_and_the bread came_in very handy to soak up all_the sauce
i'm_not sure_what my_friend_ordered but_it_was wonderfully sweet
savory_and spicy
the_kind_of heat that creeps up_on you_and makes_you want_to_eat more of_it
the_waitstaff was very_friendly_and_attentive
they_had a_good_selection_of indian_beer
one_thing_i noticed was how cleverly the_food descriptions were written on_the_menu
the imaginative and vibrant language made_it difficult_to decide what_to_order because everything sounded amazing
if you'd like_to venture off_the_strip for_something exotic i'd recommend_this_restaurant
not_a_big_fan_of buffets but i_love me_some chicken_tikka_masala
the_only_problem i_had was_some_of_the items in_the_buffet were_out and_or there_wasn't any chicken left in_it and it_was_just sauce_and they_really didn't replace it_but whatever was_available was_pretty_good the_bread_was good_to
i_just left this indian_bistro and_overall i_was_very pleased with my_experience
the_food_was well prepared and_the presentation was_clean_and simple
the vertical vindaloo curry is_delicious as_is_the cream_and tomato based curry
the_second dish listed under indian entrees
the_service_was friendly_and_attentive
i_will_be returning_to this great vegas find
mint offers_a somewhat small_but very_tasty lunch_buffet
the cuts of_meat used were_of fantastic quality for_an_indian_restaurant and_all the_food_was enjoyable
i_really_enjoyed some_of_the different touches like_a coconut_chutney and_indian soup options which i've never seen before on_a buffet
my_only small criticism is i_felt some_of_the seasoning lacked a_little_of the subtlety i_have experienced at some_of_my favourite indian_restaurants_and that keeps mint just a_tiny bit lower on_the pecking order for_me
the_curries carried that hint_of acrid taste where_you can_taste all_the individual spices rather than having them deftly blend into_a combined taste
this_is_a very minor quibble as_the food_was_still delicious
but_it's the_only_thing_i see holding mint back_from sheer excellence
prolly one_of_the_best_indian_restaurants in_las_vegas area
a_variety_of cuisines made in the_most_authentic manner
the_service_is just wonderful_and food_quality is_just amazing
every_time i_go_to vegas_i go_to_this_place without fail
there's a_lot_of haters but it_seems their issues stem from the_lunch_buffet
of_which we_did_not partake
i_went_for a_night out_with my_boyfriend_and we_opted_for the_indian_sampler
our_server_was also one_of_the
lucky owners
an extremely cordial and_friendly man who recommended some_delicious beers
it's obvious that he's a man who takes his libations seriously
which_we appreciated
he explained that during_the time_of day we_were_there
he opted to maintain the_restaurant himself
aside from showcasing an impressive work ethic
it allows him_to interact with_his customers_and gain insight on_their reactions and feelings
he takes an active interest in_the reviews_and responses of individuals and mentioned that_he periodically updates this page himself
so
hi
thanks_for the_meal
we_started_with_the don de dieu
a canadian beer with_a high alcohol percentage while still being light
floral
fruity and crisp
it_was_a_nice beverage to_sample while awaiting our_food and taking in the_environment
the_interior_is a_pleasant cool green shade with dark wood tones on_the tables
floor and chairs that we_found very soothing and appealing
there_are several pieces_of art on the_walls as_well as iron work
the bar_is well_stocked and_there_is_a window that lets you peak into the_kitchen
gently wafting in_the_background was atmosphere music
not_too obtrusive but a_pleasant addition
the_first food_that was_brought to_us were flat breads that_were studded with cumin coriander seeds
they_were folded over themselves and_super thin
with_a light crunch and_pleasant mouthfeel
they_were served_with_a mint_and tamarind_chutney
the_tamarind was sweet_and tangy but the_mint was cool and savory
i vastly preferred the_mint but we_enjoyed both
we_were given_a refill of the_bread and_sauces prior_to our_meal
the_sampler itself_was brought out_on_a large metal tray
with each_dish presented in_a_small metal container
initially it_looked_like it_may not_be that_much food
but as_we began_to ate we realized that the_small containers were easily enough_to feed
maybe even light eaters
with_a refill of_rice
we were_extremely satisfied
the_meal included
fresh baked garlic_naan
hearty flat breads with_fresh herbs and_garlic studded throughout
served_at the center of_the platter and ideal for dunking into residual sauces soup
vegetable pakodas
crispy
deep_fried bites of mixed_vegetables
excellent dipped into_the tangy and_rich homemade whole milk yogurt and_a dollop of ghost chili_sauce
chicken_tikka_masala
creamy with hearty chunks_of_chicken in_a sauce_that gradually ramps up the_heat in_your_mouth
after a_few bites it gains an addictive spice
lamb_vindaloo
like_a stew
with_a spice_and sweetness differentiating it_from the_usual western stew
i_particularly enjoyed_this and_would look_forward_to ordering it_again
organic tandoori_chicken
tender
flavorful chicken with_a yummy spice rub coating the_outside
giving_it a bright reddish pink tinge
there_were two peices and_they_were a_little small
so this_would_be the_only_downside to ordering_the platter for more_than people
they may be willing to adjust the_serving for a_larger party if_you_ask
as they_seem quite amicable
mixed vegetable_curry of_the_day
our's had lots_of zucchini
chickpeas
tomatoes and a_rich sauce
i_probably wouldn't order this by itself
but_that's simply because_i dug the_other vegetable based dish so much_more
chef's choice lentil_soup
this was_delicious
it_had_a strong turmeric flavor_and color
and was_very_flavorful
the_lentils weren't very chunky
so the_soup itself_was not exceedingly thick
i_enjoyed_the consistency
personally
fresh
homemade whole milk yogurt
one_of_my other favorite options
it_was extremely creamy with a_rich tang and was_an instant relief from some_of_the strongly flavored dishes
a_great_way_to cleanse your palate between dishes or dolloped on_top_of them
aromatic basmati_rice
a chewier
drier rice_that easily soaked up much_of the_sauce from_the dishes
a_good compliment as the_texture of_the_rice really helped to enrich and fortify the thinner or lighter dishes
khir dessert
sweet rice_pudding with_what i_thought may have_been_a hint_of rosewater
i_ate most_of_it and really_enjoyed_it
while_eating we_enjoyed two_other beers
as_well
yeti
an indian_beer that had_a hoppy
smokey flavor
it_was more_of_a dry lager
but went very_very well_with_the food
we really_enjoyed_it and_asked our_server about sourcing it
we_ended with piraat
a potent amber beer with_an earthy tang and_a hoppy afterbite
also quite_good
but strong
i_gave most of_mine to_the boy to_finish so_i_could safely navigate our journey home
i_definitely intend to_go_back sometime for_the_lunch_buffet_and their other set menus
it's_a_great introduction to a_new culture's cuisine in_a nice
relaxed atmosphere with helpful_and pleasant service
mint_bistro is_an unassuming gem in the_university section of_las_vegas
right across_the_street from unlv on flamingo
mint_bistro is_one_of_the_best indian_restaurants_in_town
the_university paradise section_of town already has around great indian_restaurants
but mint_bistro is_the_best
the_outside of_the_restaurant makes_you think that_it_is a_take_out restaurant
but_once_you walk_in you_will feel welcomed by_the comfortable indian decor
i_have_been_to mint_bistro about times
and have_always had great_food
my_favorite_dish is the_saag_paneer
which_is house made cheese sauteed with_spinach
they_make a_very_good version_of one_of_my_favorite_indian dishes
i_also really_like_the mango masala_with chicken
this_dish combines the classic flavors_of a_chicken masala_with the_sweet mango flavor
the_other dish i_usually try to_get is_the rebel curry
very_flavorful
but spicy
curry
served_with your_choice of_meat
if_you_are_a vegetarian
mint_bistro has many_options for_you
but_if_you eat meat you_have many_options
too
mint_bistro also_has a_great_selection_of belgian beers
my_favorite that_i_had was_the duchesse de bourgogne
but_they have_many more
although_it sounds random for_a indian_restaurant to_have_a great_selection_of belgian beers
they_have_some of_the_best i_have_seen
definitely try_the great pairing of_the beer with the_indian_food
if_you_are looking_for_indian and nepalese_food with_a twist
definitely try mint
before_you read_the review
you_must understand a_few_things
this_is_the_only
indian nepalese
place i've_eaten at in_vegas
the_only_other
indian
food_i've_had has_been homemade by ethnic indians or_at diwali events
i_am_not an expert in either of_these two cuisine types
but_i do like good_food
we_came_here for_a dinner_with some_friends
we_had_a friend in from china
and_since she likes to_eat
we decided_on a_place where_we can_try something new
while socializing
we_also know_that indian_food meets many_different dietary wants and needs
and this_place_has decent reviews_and reasonable_prices
so we_came to_mint
we_arrived_at pm to_a very_clean_and modern dining_room
the_dining_area was_a_little over half_full
the clientele seemed_very diverse with a_mix_of cultures and varying levels of dress
mint easily accommodated our_party of
which_was_nice
we had_a_nice big table_and were_not cramped
nor did we cramp the other_tables around us
the_staff seemed friendly enough
however
we_were waiting_for members of our_party to_arrive for about_minutes
but our waiters never asked_for drink or app orders
that_wasn't a_huge issue
but_once we_ordered apps and_drinks our_waiter didn't ask_us for our_dinner orders for_about another_minutes
we_were_all engaged in conversation
which i_guess could_have encouraged the_waiter not_to ask_us
overall
we_were_there_for hours
and_the_service_was only so_so
the_food_was_good
the_wife and_i_shared the_vegetarian sampler platter
everything_we_had was distinctive
flavorful
and_delicious
i_don't_know indian nepalese_food too well
so i_can't_say how authentic it_was or was_not
but_it_was pleasing to_my palate
we_asked_for a_level spice
but_i_am pretty_sure the_waiter did_not accommodate that as_our food_was_not too_spicy
we_like heat
and_only one_of_our dishes had a_bit_of heat
i_was_very_impressed with things
the wide_selection and friendliness towards vegans and vegetarians
we_had more selections than_we knew what to_do_with
i_am really_excited to_go_back to_mint just to_try_some more
beer_selection
there_is_a great_selection of_indian_and european beers here
they range in price from a_bottle
but they_have selections here i've not seen anywhere else in_vegas
additionally
they_do_have a
beer of_the month
which_they sell cheaper than the_others
this month the_beer is a_very_good belgian white
the brand escapes me
overall
it was_a_good_experience
other_than the_service
but_i_think i_will_be_back
i had_dinner_here tonight and_it_was_very_good
i started_with complimentary papadam with_two dipping_sauces that were_both quite_good
the_main_course was_a fusion mango_chicken made with_fresh mango
i_had an_order_of garlic_naan_with the_meal_and a_glass_of delicious mango_lassi
i_guess by now you_can see_the theme of my_dinner tonight
after the_main part_was over
i_had kheer
indian rice_pudding
for_dessert
it_was_a small
whiskey shot glass sized dessert that_was_a perfect ending to the_meal
i_really_enjoyed_the place although when_it's crowded
the seating might_be_a little close_to your neighboring diners
for out_of towners who know the_area
mint_is almost directly across flamingo road from_the atomic testing museum
delicious vegan_friendly food
chau_chau was_out_of_this_world
we_were_the_only patrons on our_visit
so the_service_was first rate
appetizers_were flavorful
including_the momo's that we_tried
i_didn't realize the nepalise element here
turkey on_the_menu at indian_places is odd
but the_food_was_very_good overall
beer_selection was impressive but_i didn't_have_the right circumstances to participate in_that
i_recently tried_the_lunch_buffet there
and_it_was alright
you_could tell some_dishes weren't freshly made and_the_chicken_was also bit_dry
i_also felt there weren't enough selection also
service_was_great though
just had_the_lunch_buffet
the_service_was_good the_food_was_delicious
i'll definitely be_back
i_usually find_the food_in_las_vegas not_very_good
i_am_an outsider
my_only experiences have_been on_the_strip
so please don't think this_is_a blanket statement about the_entire area
but
on_and around the_strip i_have generally found the_food sub par and relatively expensive
i_don't doubt some_of_the food_is_excellent
but i_don't_want_to pay morton's prices just to_get high_quality foods
thank_you yelp
without which i_would_not have discovered mint_indian_bistro
excellent_service with good_prices
we_asked_for our server's recommendations on_a entree budget
for_two_people
we_had more_than enough_food and_were very_happy_with the_quality_and subtle flavors and_spices
also
typically indian_food leaves my digestive track in lurches afterwards
not_so here
a_great reasonable dinner just off_the_strip
that_is
as_good_as_it gets
in_las_vegas
i_have_been coming_here since i_found_it in_its prior name
himalayan restaurant
the_first_time_i came_here
we_used the_coupon from restaurant
com
i_had_a hard time finding a_good indo pak restaurant
so_good thing there_is restaurant
com
first_time
appetizer
himalayan samosas potatoes_and peas
stuffed in_a light fluffy pastry
but
the_best_thing about_this is dipping it into the_tamarind_chutney
dang this_is awesome
chicken rebel curry spicy
not_much else
i_haven't_been ordering this
not memorable
let's move on
lamb_vindaloo spicy_and tons_of flavor
the_lamb was_nice_and tender
garlic_naan_were not short_of garlic
top that lamb_vindaloo pieces with_a shred of onion_and dip it into the_tamarind_chutney
wow
mango_lassi is_good as ever
my_friend said_that coupon or no coupon
we_are coming back fo sho
second time
didn't use a_coupon so_we_were able_to_get
indian_sampler
garlic_naan
pakodas dumpling kinda look
with vegetable stuffed inside
the_outside is_a chickpea batter
this_was dipped into_a nutty sauce
interesting combination
chicken_tikka_marsala
lamb_vindaloo
tandoori_chicken chicken was_very juicy with_a_nice spice rub
vegetable_curry for_a vegetable_curry
this_is so_flavorful
yogurt
this_was homemade
it_was super tart
too tart for_my_taste
basmati_rice
i_am_used_to the jasmine rice
but_this basmati is_on a_new playing field
khir dessert is_this rice_pudding
basmati_rice
yay
in milk
spiced
with_nuts and raisins
this is_one_of_my_favorite dessert
once_again
bursting with flavors
this sampler was_perfect
we_got_to tried out everything
recommend for adventurous newbies
they_weren't super_spicy either so_is easy on_the tongue
and tummy
since there_are_so may other dish_that one can alternate between_the spicy one
lamb_vindaloo
third time_and so on
ghosht karahi
goat_curry
flavors remind me_of back_home
aahhhh
i_miss home
ok
focus
so
my routine comes_to play
i ask_for a_side_of onion_and some lemon wedges
i mix the_onion with the_goat_curry
and squeeze lemon in_it
it's amazing how the_onion would_make the_flavor even spicier
and_how the lemon juice brings out_that tang
now try_this with the_best_naan that i_have_tasted yet
the_naan with fruits in_the_middle
this_is_the_only place_that have_it
as far_as i_know
you_get savory and_sweet
have mango_lassi_with this entree is the_perfect combination
of_course i_have the khir at_the_end_of my every meal
service_has always_been super for_me
the_owners_are sooooooo fantastic
they_are_so kind_and wonderful
i_love_the decor
oh
i_forgot to_mention
they_have_a very extensive beer_selection
my_friends always_order beer_and try like three different kinds every_time
i stick_to my mango_lassi_and am happy_with it
this was_absolutely_delicious
had_the malai_kofta_and was_amazing
i_can't_say enough good_things about_this_place
i'd had_their food back_when they_were called himalayan restaurant and_it_was_very_good
my_recent dinner visit was_the_first_time i_had actually been inside the_restaurant_and the_first_time i'd had_the food_since they_came under new ownership
the_waiter was_very_helpful and_friendly
he_suggested getting the_vegan sampler when_we informed him we_wanted_to_try everything on_the_menu
so
we_ordered_the vegan sampler which_was perfect for_two_people
every item was_amazing except_for_the carrot
i_think
which was_a_little_too sweet for_my_taste
the_sampler comes_with two sides of_basmati_rice
roti_and six or seven other_items
the_soup and chana saag were my_favorites
i'll definitely be_back_to_try the_dosas
my_boyfriend_and his buddy went_here the_other_night
they ordered multiple entrees
including_a two for_one tikka_masala
we_all greatly enjoy their yogurt
so_they finished off their helpings and_asked_for extras
which the_service complied with
when they_were leaving
he_asked for an_extra yogurt so_that he_could bring some home_for the_leftovers
when the_check was_brought to_the_table
he_was able to_take_a look_at it_before another one_was quickly brought out
when he_asked why he_was being given_a different check
he_was told it_was_so that they_could apply the_two for_one tikka_masala
that_was untrue the_first check already showed the_two for_one discount
the_only discernable difference was_that he'd been charged a dollar for the_yogurt
it's_not_a big_deal that_they charged him a dollar for the_yogurt the_problem is_that_they obviously felt_the need_to lie about_it after failing to_mention anything earlier
that_was really disappointing
we_will probably be_back_for the_food_and interesting beer_selection
but being lied to is a_big turn off
great_food
decent service_at not_a_bad price
i_will_go there_again and_again
in_fact we_ate ther everyday except one_day while_we stayed at vegas for_days
will_go_back again
we_went_there for_lunch_buffet and_the_food_was very_disappointing
even their lassi bar was_not_good
will_never go_back_to this_place_again
lunch_buffet_is awesome
a_good_variety_of indian favorites and_they bring_out fresh_naan
on_top_of_that students get a_discount
for lunch_and_dinner
ok here_is why i_am_giving mint
we_walked_in before the_lunch_buffet_was about to_close
the_owner offered_to keep things as_long as_we like and_even cooked up more_food that got low
he personally came_over talked to_use and_went the_extra mile
to make_this a_great_experience
note for_those with restaurant
com certificates
apparently they_have_a conflict with restaurant
com and aren't accepting their coupons
however
they honored the discount themselves and_told_us to_get_a refund for_our certificate and_will probably do the_same for others
he looked upset a_bit explaining it so_it's probably something ugly
i_thought_it_was cool that they_will honor it themselves to_help out the_customers
for_years i_ate indian_food_on a weekly basis and for_a_while i stayed away since_i burned out_and the_bf never had_indian_food_before so away we_went
the_drink selection_is one main reason that made_me really want_to try_them
we_are beer nerds so it_makes for a_lovely surprise that_a unassuming bistro would_have such_an impressive drink menu
the_bf wasn't sure of_what
and_our_server
i_think possibly the_owner
asked_what kinds_of flavors he likes and_gave a_few recommendations
i_always appreciate a_place_that knows what_they sell since it_seems most_people don't_care about beer the_way they_do of_wine
the_bf took his suggestion of_a augustjn abbey ale
and_i_had_a troubadour obscura
which the_guy poured into tulips with care to produce a proper head
i_had_a nerd moment that_they_had the proper kind of glasses and someone cared about our_drinks as_much as_we do
he treated it like_a sommelier would a_fine wine
while we_waited_for food we_were_served papadam with_a tamarind_chutney and_a cilrantro mint_chutney
all really finely made
for_food we_really couldn't decide to we_went_with a indian_sampler
it_doesn't look_like a_lot_of_food
but we_were_both comfortably full
it includes
chicken_tikka_masala this_was_a lovely tikka
i've had_a_lot and_this_was one_of_the_better ones i've_had
very robust
but balanced
the_bf loved_this and raves it's_the_best curry he's had and_he had_a foodie moment
aww
i_think us yelpers are getting to_him
maybe he'll change his mind about doing reviews one_day
lamb_vindaloo the_lamb_was very_tender and_the_sauce complimented it very_well with_a_bit earthiness
tangyness and a_tad spicy
tandoori_chicken crisp_and nicely spiced outside
juicy inside
mixed veggie curry had_a_good mix_of cauliflower
zucchini
beans
peppers
the_curry had_a_very light_and fragrant flavor to_it
i_can't quite place the_spices
but_i liked this
chef choice_of lentils today it_was daal
i_like daal since_it's earthy and comforting
we_got yoghurt
basmati_rice
and_garlic_naan as_well
the_naan_was pretty noms here
khir came_with it for_dessert
it's_a rice_and milk porridge with raisins
nuts and cardamom according_to the_menu
when_i_was eating_it
to_me it_tasted more flowery than_just cardamom
like possible orange blossom water_was added
it's the_kind_of light dessert that_would_be amazing for_a hot summer day since_it's served cold_and has such bright flavors
we also_ordered another dessert that i_thought_i had and_loved at another_restaurant and_at friends house but haven't come across it in_a_while
turns out it_was what i_was_looking_for
lal mohan
the description says it's served cold
but_it's served piping_hot
it's these round pastries that_are fried so the_outside is crisp_and the_inside has_a creamy kind of dough
they throw it into syrup and_it absorbs it so_it flavors it throughout
they come_to a serving in a_shot glass
balls are_about gumball sized so_you don't_get much_of it
but_it's quality
it's_a comforting kind of dessert that_would_be a_good for_people who like fried mochi with honey
warm donuts
zeppolis
beignets
the_service_was friendly_and_helpful
i_like_the little details that show they care like having proper beer glasses or giving us warm plates
utensils were impeccably polished no water marks at_all
it_felt very comfortable with_the warm decor_and the_good staff making you_feel good about being there
i just_got a_strong feeling that_they_are proud of_this_place in_the pride they_take for_the little details
i_haven't_been this surprisingly satisfied in_a_long_time
the_bf was_super happy_with discovering indian_food_and having_a food epiphany of sorts about_it
days later he's still telling me_about the_tikka and_how he wants_to go next weekend
definitely we_will_be coming_back_for a_la_carte and_also the_buffet sounds like_a deal
if our_next experience is_as_good_as this_one
it_can quickly grow to_be_a favorite
stars
it_was_a_very similar day to_my previous review
copious laundry yet to_be folded and lazy me coerced my_husband to thinking that_we need_to partake in mint's buffet this last saturday
i_remembered a message one_of_the_owners of mint had sent me letting me know that_they_had taken my previous review into consideration and created a_better buffet
it's_a rare occasion that small business owners give_you positive reactions on_a negative review so i_was_impressed enough_to give mint another_chance
wow
the of_us_were truly surprised
in a_really_good way
and_absolutely enjoyed_this buffet
there_was_a thin tomato_soup that_was tangy and_a prolific salad chutney assortment
also their dal tadka was_to_die_for
i filled multiple bowls_of this delicacy
the_pakoras
indian vegetable tempura
were_excellent
special shout out to_the thinly slivered potatoes coated with_the garbanzo flour mixture
yumminess
soft_and airy idlis with_a thick_and tasty sambar
the_best_in vegas thus far
spoke to_the south_indian in me
there_was lemon_rice that_was full_of_flavor and_their spicy chau_chau noodles that_were oh_so perfect_and what_i_am currently salivating about
there_were vegetable_dishes
one paneer
and_at least meat based dishes on_the_buffet
garlic naans plain naans rotis were_brought to_the_table with_the blink of_an eye
now for_the grand finale
dessert
my_eyes popped when_i saw they_served gulab_jamun
balls of dough and milk
deep_fried and served_in sugar syrup
the_gulab jamuns were warm
melt in_the mouth and probably the_best_i've_had out_here
dessert nirvana
mint pulled out all_the stops at_their new buffet_and_i for_one
will_be_a repeat customer as_long as_i get_my belly filled like_this
for
this_was_a stellar deal and_of_course
the_service_was just_as impeccable as before with_the nice waiters
i've_always wanted_to check_this_place out but_never knew where it_was until_i passed it while_we_were on_our way_to mob month at_the library
i_definitely wanted to_try_it so_i kept a mental note for after_the lecture
we_started off_with drinks i_had_the rose lassi
the rose flavor was_really delicate
it didn't_taste like_i_was consuming a rose garden
my_husband_had_the pomegranate martini
he thought it_was_a_little strong and_so did_i but_i_don't_think that taste can_be avoided when_you_are mixing juice with vodka
i've_had a martini made_with baileys before
i_think that's more my speed
i_don't_think it_was_a true martini but_the taste_is much smoother
i_ordered_the half order_of lamb_biryani
it_was_good but while_i_was eating_it i_came across some very strong spices
you_know the_feeling when_you accidentally bite into_a peppercorn
it_felt like_that but_i'm not_sure what type_of spice it_was
it_looked_like a miniature piece_of a tree branch but_the tender lamb made_up_for_it
my_husband ordered_the_chicken_tikka salad
the seasonal veggies that_came_with salad were_super fresh
good size cucumbers tomatoes
and_chicken
beautiful colors
it_tasted good_too
it's perfect for_a_late night snack that_will not weigh you down
it_tasted even_better when_you put some_of_the salad on the_naan_and roll it_up
my_husband agreed that i_know_what i'm talking about_it because_he liked_it
that's no easy feat
we_wanted_to_try some dessert so_i_ordered the_mango kulfi
it's basically a milky mango_ice_cream
it's_not sour like_a sorbet
it_was_pretty tasty
my_husband went out_of his vanilla box of_his basic dessert choices
he_also had_no choice because_there is_no ice_cream sundaes here
he ordered_the lal mohan which looked kind of_like like juicy brown eggs
i_thought_the he might be scared off_by it but_he tried_it and like_it
i_tried some too
if_you_are the type that_doesn't like too_much syrup on_your french toast then_this may_not be for_you
i'm one of_those people
these_are milk based pastries drowning in syrup
it_was cool trying something new though
the service_was_awesome
our_waiter helped us decide on_the desserts
he genuinely cared what we_thought of_the_food
which_was refreshing
the_waiter had_a_nice warm personality where when_he said
hope you come_back soon
you_have_to believe him
if_you_like_indian_food
go_here
you_will_not be sorry
delicious food_and_great staff
i_can't_wait_to_go_back and try_the_buffet
indian_buffet has_always been_a noun combination i could_get behind
or into_my belly
and_then i_did
for ten bucks i consumed heartily a_fine assortment_of deliciousness
i_wish_i_had more to_say
but_really
i_enjoyed everything_i popped on and_in
i_was_so craving_indian_food
it's_been months since_i've had_any and due_to my_last experience at_namaste several months_ago i_needed an_indian fix
thanks_to the_reviews of fellow yelpers i_took_my talemts to_mint
so after_reading their_menu on line for a_few_days i new my_wife_and_i would_be getting the_indian_sampler
served_with rice
homemade yoghurt
and khir for_dessert
garlic_naan fresh warm_and pretty much melted in_your_mouth
i_like to_use_it to scoom the_rice_and other_dishes
vegetable pakodas fried veggie chips with_plenty_of flavor
lentil the_chef's way lentil_soup
very_tasty had_a hint_of cilantro that was_outstanding
the_lamb_and chicken_dishes were_so warm
flavorfull and comforting
i_only chose level spice not knowing how hot it_would_be
next_time_i_will leap to_a
not_being brave but curious
and i_do_not eat spicy_food at_all
so_much to say_about these_dishes but please go_and experience them for_yourself
you_will_not be dissapointed
not_a_fan_of rice puuding
the khir which_is similar was fery smooth
rich
tasty ans flavorful
can't_wait_to go_back
thanks_to my_friends for coming along
who_have dinned here_before and enjoyed_it once_again
awesome_food here
an impressive menu_with tons_of veg_dishes
gulab_jamun was_a_little sweet
but delish savory plates way made_up_for_it
i've_been_to mint_indian_bistro for_dinner once before
but_i wasn't blown_away by the_food
luckily
i tried_the_lunch_buffet this time_around
and was_pleasantly_surprised at the_quality_of_the_food
one_thing that_i_did like on my_first_visit and_still like about_this_place_is the_decor
it's_definitely a_good place_to_go_for a romantic date
i_also am fond of the_service_here
anyways
back_to_the food
at_the_table
the_server brought_us our choice_of either plain
butter or garlic_naan
we chose garlic
and_also roti
a thinner bread made_with whole_wheat
the_garlic_naan_was yummy soft
warm_and studded with_garlic bits
it_was_perfect for_dipping into_the soups and curries
the roti was_good_too
but_i definitely prefer the_naan
i_can't_remember all_i ate
but_i_will list off my_favorites
there were_three soup varieties
i_enjoyed_the sambhar soup
a hearty lentil_soup
the_most
i_also enjoyed_the seasoned rice dish
as_well_as_the chicken_tandoori and a_vegetarian dish called paneer_tikka_masala
blocks of soft cheese simmered in_a spicy tomato based stew
i_also thought the_chicken_curry dish to_be flavorful_and good
for_dessert
i had_a_few cubes_of watermelon and_one piece_of gulab_jamun
fried balls of dough soaked in_a sweet syrup flavored with cardamom and rosewater
i_wish_i went_back_for seconds on dessert though
the_best_part about the_lunch_buffet is_that_it_is healthy or_at least tastes healthy
all in_all
i had_a_nice time_here
i_would_probably go_back again for_lunch
that_is
p
s
parking here during busy times can_be dangerous
small parking_lot
too_many cars
etc
be_careful
service is_very_friendly
million times better_than_the indian_restaurant we_go_to in la valley
the_green cilantro dipping sauce for_the pappadams is_super fresh
soups are_so_good served steaming hot tried both the_dal the bean lentil
love_the ayce lunch_buffet
items change daily
so i_need_to keep going_back_to catch the_chana_masala
just_wish tney offered dosas as part_of buffet_but they_do_have an ayce dosa nite
but_there_are always vegan_options available on buffet those soups
salad fresh papadams
definitely_a return_to place
my_favorite indian_cuisine in_the_valley
the_food_is_fresh
delicious
and_perfectly seasoned
i_highly_recommend_this restaurant to_anyone
regardless if you've ever_eaten this kind of food_before
i've_eaten from both the_lunch_buffet_and the a_la_carte_menu
and_have_been delighted every_time
with every_dish
my_favorites include their_tandoori_chicken
turkey mo mo
potato_and pea samosas
and_their delectable garlic_naan
their beer_selection is_excellent
and_the_atmosphere_is lovely
a
there_are many decent indian_restaurants_in_town
but here_is one_more yelp vote calling this_place the best_indian_lunch_buffet in_vegas
big selection
so even_if one item is_not to_your liking
ingredient or spice wise
there will_be plenty else to nosh on
service_is quick to_get beverages and_naan on_the_table
and tables cleared for new customers
you_feel very welcome here
side note
always_a bummer though to_see_how much food_is wasted at buffets here in_town
c'mon folks take_a lil to_see_if ya like_it
and_if_you do
go_back_for more
discarding plates still piled with food_is appalling
and please at least have_had a_meal in_the_last hours the single diner next_to us sat down_and demanded three baskets of_naan right_off_the bat
did he finish them
no
i'm usually here_for_lunch
and they_do_a very_nice buffet every_time i've_been_here
there's_a nice mix_of vegetarian and_meat_dishes
and_i've never seen the_exact same menu two_days in_a row for_lunch
dinner_here is_good too
they_do_a nice tandoori_chicken
which_is how every indian_restaurant should be judged in_my_opinion
at least if they_offer it
overall
very_happy_with this_place
and they_also_have_a limited bar menu
plus wine_and beer
i_went_to mint a_couple_of_weeks ago_with a_bunch_of fellow computer scientists for_a birthday lunch
the_place_is pretty_small and_the_buffet area seems small
but the_selection_is decent
if you_know me at_all
you'll know_that the_first_thing i look_for is butter_chicken
a_quick scan of_the lineup reveals a disappointing no
so right_off_the bat
this puts them at_a disadvantage against namaste
then i_found_the goat_curry
at an_indian_buffet
i_really only need one go_to item and luckily
the_goat_curry was off_the hook
it's_not quite the_naan heaven that_is butter_chicken
but paired with_rice
i_enjoyed every morsel
as for_the_naan
i_like how they_bring it_out to_order
this can lead to moments of_naan less agony
but_at least you_know it's_always warm_and fresh when_it_comes_to your_table
the_garlic_naan has_an overpowering aroma and is_the_only way_to fly
i_haven't_tried any of_their lassis
but_that will_definitely change today at_the cmye
i_love me_some mango_lassi
but the_other flavors_are intriguing
overall
i'm definitely a_fan_of this_place
quite honestly
i'd pick namaste over mint_for one simple reason
which should be easy_to deduce by now
still
mint_is a_solid lunch_buffet choice
edit
i've since been_back and_i'm not_sure why i_thought_the buffet area_is small
there_are quite a_few_dishes from which to_choose
i_guess it's because_i only found a_couple_of items_that interested me
i've_been_here many_times for_dinner
but_not buffet
this_review_is_for_the lunch_buffet
there_were many_items in the_buffet_line
ranging_from vegetarian to meat courses
the_quality_and taste of_the_dishes exceed my_expectations even_more now
i_love goat karahi
i_have_been_to many_indian_restaurants where the_goat karahi isn't consistent
i_know i_can count on mint to_make_sure that each piece is tender_and flavorful
i mixed my tender chunks_of goat meat with slices of onions_and cucumbers
then squeezed lemon on_them and tossed it around some_more
it_was_delicious
and_the_naan_was great_as_well
however
goat karahi wasn't the_only star on today's menu
according_to me
of_course
i_have_tried tandoori_chicken at many_places
but_i find_it lacks flavor
when debbie said_that the_tandoori_chicken is her favorite
i_decided_to grab_a piece to_give_it_a_try
boy was_i glad debbie raved_about it
it_was sooooo gooood
i tore off a_piece_of this delicious chicken that bursted with_flavor and put_it on_top_of freshly baked garlic_naan
i_then dipped it into the_tamarind_chutney and wala
yummy in_my tummy
i_was full at_this_point
but_still had to_eat my_favorite dessert
khir
i_was super excited to_see_this in the_buffet_line
i_love_the basmati_rice
slow cooked_in milk with_a dash of cardamom
i_got two servings
one for roland
and_one for_myself
somehow
they both ended up being consumed by me
oops
khir
i_can't help myself
i_also_had the lal mohan
again
tried_this at_other_places
never liked_it
luckily
debbie also raved_about this so_i gave it_a_shot
thank goodness i_tried_it because_it_is delicious
and_the_staff
attentive_and_friendly
as_always
the_food_is_delicious_and they_have_a good_selection
i've_never_had bad_service any_time of day that_i've gone
and_their bar_is pretty diverse
this_is_definitely a
staple
indian_restaurant for_me
even i_am_not familiar_with_indian_food
only curry_and naan
this is_really_good experience to_me
i_was little late for_the event so_i didn't get_enough information about every food in_there but_still i taste most of_them
the_food_wasn't greasy at_all
i_really_like that part
i_like goat_curry_and yellow curry
with veggie
i'll find_out this one's name next_time
i_hope their new_menu working well
their drink have different texture but was_good
i_will_be there_again
i_really want to_give_this restaurant all five_stars
just_because the_service_was fantastic
however
i_can't_say that_i loved_the_food entirely
this won't stop me_from coming back though since_i did only try the_items_on their lunchtime buffet menu
i_will_definitely have to_go_back for_dinner
i_will just point_out the positive aspect of_my experience_for now
fantastic_service
right when_i_walked through_the doors
i_was greeted_by_the staff and_felt very welcome
our_waiter made_sure to_check up_on us several_times during our_meal and_was_very hospitable
nice accommodation
very cute and quaint mom_and_pop restaurant
the_interior decor_is_nice and_their choice_of music is_very soothing
the_restaurant_is very_clean as_well
which_is_a huge plus
food
i'm_not a_huge_fan_of rice_pudding but they_actually won me over with_their rice_pudding
their_garlic_naan is also_delicious very_light and_fluffy
actually
i_really loved most_of_their vegetarian_vegan dishes
this_place_was a frickin gem found right closely off_the vegas_strip
authentic
delicious tibetan nepalese_food very testy mango_lassie
try the_nepalese dinner
for_two
its was_perfect
even for_people
i yelped and_i googled and_i yelped when i_was_in_the process of purchasing a voucher from restaurant
com
the_foods was_great but not_for_the money
this_is_my first_time_i tried rest voucher
i_took_a friend with_me
it_was_definitely a_lot less valuable as groupon
from_what i've gathered
there_was groupon offered at_this_restaurant recently
groupon imposed no conditions on money spent
i assume you ordered foods or_more with_your purchase
then_you paid the tax and tips on top
for_a minimal of
rest voucher dictated you ordered twice as_much and paid tip
plus tax
for voucher
you_may pay_for it
you_have_to order min of_food
so the_final total was_about
what's my saving
if i've got_the voucher for_free
i_still paid about
how_much is_my saving then
if_i order the_foods without_the voucher
i_would_have paid about too
what's wrong_with this picture
with_this irritation aside
the_foods were_good
not excellent
but_tasty
i_was_surprised with_a one page nepalese section
i_have_never tried nepalese foods before
and_i_don't consume east indian_foods often
so_we_ordered nepalese sampler
and_a tandouri chicken
there_was_also_a indian_sampler for
available
the_portion on_the sampler was_so small
oz per metal cup
that_i_could easily finish by myself_and still feel hungry
it_came_with pieces_of turkey dumpling
oz red curry_chicken
cubes
oz vegetarian
small pieces_of skewed lamb
in oz cup
oz broth
oz cucumber salad
servings of oz steamed rice
small pieces_of brown desserts
and_one cut up naan
luckily we_had tandouri chicken to contribute a_small space in_our stomach
it_came_with small pieces_of thighs and drumstick with_plenty_of onions
i_have to_be_honest
i_don't_have a_fine palate for_indian_cuisine
the_nepalese foods tasted like indian_foods
even_though_it tasted_good
but_i_had similar or better at various cities
a_meat sampler costs
and tandouri chicken
during a visit_to flagstaff
i_thought_it_was a_bit_pricey at_the_time comparing to_the_restaurant in socal excluding san diego
the_service_was plain ordinary
i_can hardly understand our server's thick accent
i wound never_have paid tips on_this kind of_service
the_location was off_the_strip but in_the midst of asian commercial district
there_were many_indian and_some filipino restaurants in_the_neighborhood
so diners
beware what_you are getting from restaurant
com voucher
it_feels_like a scam to benefit the_restaurants
groupon is a_better deal here
i_feel the_price_is at least more_than other_places
regardless vegas charm or_not
i_won't be_back_for there_is no knowledge gain but a_bad overall experience and_the worse value i_have_ever_had for_a_long_time
absolutely tasty
this_place is_one_of_the_best indian_restaurants_i've_been_to
there mixture_of indian
tibetan and nepal is_a refreshing blend
the_first_time_i went_there i_asked_for paneer_pakora which wasn't on_the_menu_and the_owner went_to the_kitchen_and made_me up a_plate which tasted amazing
they_have lots_of beers from_india and alot_of lassi drinks
just_to prove my_taste_buds are_on the_level i_recently brought a_friend who's wife is from_india and_she said very_tasty_and top_notch
well_worth_it
nice_atmosphere as_well
everything was_really_great
nice_atmosphere and delicious_food
cant wait to_go_back
if_you_like_indian_food or would_like_to give indian_food a_try you can't_go_wrong_with mint india
had_their combination plate for_dinner some months_ago and went_there today with_a_group_of friends for_the_lunch_buffet
fantastic food_at_a low price
if_you're_a beer lover have_the taj_mahal with_your food_and_the tikla
sp
gold for_dessert
the_garlic_naan_is exceptional
stopped_in for_the_lunch_buffet_and the_selection_was wonderful had all_the basic indian_dishes
there were_a_lot_of vegetarian_dishes i winced at
for person
it's a_great_deal
me_and_my friends went to_the_lunch_buffet for_the_first_time
so this_review_is_for_the lunch_buffet only
the_selection_is very_limited with a_total of about items
that's including the_desserts and soups but_not including_the chutney_bar
which_has about chutneys
which i_don't_care much about
the_food_is ok for_the_price
but_not_the service
me_and_my friends just felt like we_weren't welcome there
the_servers never greeted us when_he saw us walking_in
also_very slow when_it_comes_to taking away the_plates
we only_had plates each
not like_it_was busy in_any way
the_restaurant_was half empty despite it's small space
during_the
granted brief
time_we_were_there he never_came to_our_table to_check if_we need more naan or_not
after we_got_our second plate
the_server gave us the_check without asking
and without saying a_word to_us
we_gave him the_money and_were supposed_to get bucks something as change but_he just assumed that's the tip for_him
which to his credit he_was right
but_i_still expected him to_bring the_change back first
but_he never did
of_course when_we_left there's no acknowledgement or goodbye in_any form
their bad manner and_service
might
have_something to_do_with my_friends being chinese
a form_of prejudice
they didn't_think we'll tip
we_weren't wearing suits but t shirts and jeans
i_don't_know for_sure
we won't be_back
that's for_sure
i_have experienced a_few misses while trying_to find a_good_indian_restaurant
this_place_is_the total package
the_decor_is filled_with soothing earth tones
the_employees are friendly_and_attentive
the_food_is pleasing to_the palate
the_best_part
the_lunch_buffet_is only
at_this price
i_can afford to_buy lunch for_myself and_a_few friends
unlike my_last experience_at a_different restaurant
mint_is great at keeping the_hot foods hot_and the_cold foods cold
the_salad and fruit selections were limited
but_they_were crisp and_refreshing
i_am_a sucker for_indian sauces
my_favorite being mango and mint_chutney
i_can eat_it with everything
the vast selection_of gluten_free
vegetarian
and vegan_friendly foods makes_it a no brain option_for when_i'm with friends_who steer away from meat
the kadhai paneer_was one_of_my_favorites
a firm cheese with_a mild taste in_a curry_sauce
yet meat lovers will_not_go hungry
the_tandoori_chicken was_cooked_to_perfection
nice juicy pieces that_were seasoned exceptionally well
chicken chilli was probably_the_best meat dish offered though
the_spice is_not over powering but strong
try the_rice_pudding
the_only criticisms i_have are that certain dishes_were either too_sweet or too_salty
the_masala rice needed to_be mixed_with some basmati
the galub jamun gave_me an instant toothache and numbness of_the tongue from_the sugar overload
other_than_that
i_would happily come_here again
we_were ravenous and this_was_the_first vegas eatery we dined at
i_believe the_lunch_buffet_is open until
i_chose this_restaurant due_to_the veg friendly sites touting vegan naan
the_buffet had_plenty_of vegan_and vegetarian items to_choose_from_and my omni boyfriend had_a_few meat_options to_satisfy his flesh eating desires
while_i enjoyed_my vegan naan he thought_it_was just 'ok' and_ordered an_additional basket_of the_original version
they_had three different soups and_i_think all of_them at least vegetarian
the surprise of_our_meal was how delicious their wittekerke belgian wheat beer
was
it_was yummy and we_ordered_a second round
they_also have awesome mango_chutney
our_server appeared aloof or stoned
but_it didn't_really bother us
great_lunch for a_decent price
truly the_best_indian_food at very reasonable_prices
kwati soup
tandoori_chicken and_saag_paneer half orders_were plenty for_two_people to_share
wayne gorsek
we_went_to mint with_great expectations after_reading all_the rave reviews
my_experience was_average at_best
ves
the_staff_was_friendly
very clean_place
the_food looked freshly prepared and_was_not oily at_all
they_had a_variety_of chutneys
dips and_fresh salad_and fruit
the_kheer
indian rice_pudding
was_yummy
the_naan_was crisp
i_would_have preferred a dash of butter as that's how i_like_the garlic_naan but the_taste_was not_bad
the sambhar
idli and_chutneys tasted very_good
not_so ve
the_vegetarian choices were just_ok
the pakoras_were cold_and therefore not crisp
the_potato and bellpepper
and_the shahi_paneer were_ok but lacked flavor
the_spinach tasted more_like garlic than spinach
we_asked_for tandoori rotis and_got tandoori roti between the_of_us and had_to_ask_for another tandoori roti_and naan
i_was_told that the_chicken and_meat_dishes were just_ok
am_not sure_if my_experience was colored by_my expectation but i_was_expecting more
the_price_was great though
charming cheap
a_wonderful small getaway
not the_typical endless vegas buffet
just_enough choices to_get_your buffet fix
small enough_to not_have to stand in_line for_minutes just to_get_your food
nice_and simple appropriate decor
a_busy place_for_lunch
but relaxing as_well
top buffets in_vegas
after days in_the grand canyon this was_the_perfect meal
the_indian_sampler had_a_little tapas size portion of_all_the 'greatest hits' of_indian_cuisine and was_perfect for_people
my_husband enjoyed_the gluten_free beer_selection
we_asked_for it not too_spicy but_it_was_still pretty_spicy
but_i_like spicy
so_that was_ok
the_staff_are very_nice_and place_is_really clean
especially their bathroom
i_love things in_vegas that make_you forget where_you are
this_is_one_of those places
my_husband_and_i have_been_to several indian_restaurants_in_vegas
and this_one_is our_favorite
we drive all_the_way to_mint from summerlin b c the closer indian_places just_don't make food_as good_as mint does
restaurant_is clean
simple decor
staff_is nice
and you_can't beat_the
lunch_buffet they_offer
buffet isn't huge
but does offer enough delicious choices to_be satisfied
also comes_with naan
i'm especially a_fan_of the_chicken_tikka_masala
it's my_favorite_indian dish and_they know_how_to make_it right here
definitely check them_out when_you're in_the_mood for_a_good_indian meal
before_i was_going_to write this_review
i_wanted to_check_out namaste so_i_can compare both lunch_buffets
let's just_say mint_indian_bistro won hands down
i've_had both the_lunch_buffet_and ala_carte dinner
both_were great but_the bargain is_definitely the all_you_can_eat lunch_buffet_for
they_had a_good_variety_of both vegetarian and_meat_dishes
including chicken_korma
they_make some_of_the best around
great_flavor
creamy_sauce
my_fellow diners also loved the_lunch_buffet
one even exclaimed
if all_vegetarian food_tasted this good
he'd be a_vegetarian
buffet includes tandoori_chicken_and a_lamb_dish and they_bring warm naan_bread to_your_table
they_also have an_extensive drink menu large_selection of_indian_and belgian beers as_well as specialty cocktails
this_is_a definite
will_return
spot
we_had_the vegetarian sampler
plentiful quantity for_two_people and every_dish was_very_tasty
i_am never the_first to suggest a_buffet
but mint's lunch_buffet has won me over
hands down
i_love_the wide assortment_of dishes
my fiance can enjoy the_meat_dishes
while i've no lack in the_selection_of vegetarian_options
and let's not forget the_delicious naan
light with the_perfect balance_of softness and crispness
all_for a_cool
on weekdays
oh
and unlv students get a_discount
my_favorite_dishes are the_aloo saag
chana saag
and chau_chau
all are packed_with such great spices and_full_of_flavor
i_can't leave without having a_little bowl_of the khir
rice_pudding
and_also enjoy their gajar haluwa
the_carrot pudding
i_have dined here_for_dinner
but find i_have such_a tough time choosing one_dish because i've become so used_to sampling them_all at the_lunch_buffet
the_staff_is excellent
you_can catch the_owner
very_friendly
from time_to time
the_restaurant_is always very_clean
a_friend introduced me to_mint two years_ago and_i've_been hooked ever_since
auuuggghhh
i_don't_want_to give out five_stars anymore
my reviews are_too positive
i_have too_many five_star reviews
so_i changed the_way_i rate places
i'm more critical now and_an establishment has to_go way above and beyond expectations or be the_best_i've_had in_its category
unfortunately
mint_indian_bistro is_the_best indian_food_i_have_ever_had
period
i_know
my_life sucks
all i_want_to do is give_a critical review
but_i keep having outstanding experiences
when_i opened the_menu_and saw dosas in_the appetizers
i_knew_i was_about the_experience something special
dosas
my use_of redundant punctuation should indicate the percentage exceeding one hundred that represents how_much i_love a_good dosa
mint has giant flaky dosas filled_with many different_types_of awesomeness
both southern and northern_indian recipes are included on_the_menu
as_well as tibetan and_nepalese entree selections
i_know of nothing_like this back_home in seattle
if someone else does
please tell_me
this_place_was great from beginning to_end
i_don't do dessert at_indian_restaurants so i_can't_speak to_that
but_i_did have_a delicious blackberry lassi which i_can_say served a dual purpose as dessert beginning of_the_evening cocktail
they have_a_lunch_buffet
but_i_didn't get_to do_that since my_friend is a_bit_of_a germophobe about buffets
so
in conclusion
best
awesome
great
and_delicious
i'll have_to_wait another day at different restaurant to_be comfortably critical
i_can always go_back_to chutney's back_home
i_guess
really average_food in buffet_for_lunch
it_was_a_good selection but food_was a_little_less than i_would_expect
my cousin and_i_are fans of_indian_food_and when i_saw_the reviews decided we_had to_check_it_out
it_was_excellent
first a note on_the atmosphere
the_restaurant had_been booked for_some event that sounded like_a presentation on maintaining your visa
the event ran over_and they_were_not taking walk ins so_it's difficult_to give_a proper evaluation of_the noise and the_typical crowd
however we_had_a reservation and_the_staff quickly adjusted
the_fact_that an all_indian event would choose this_place says something_about the authenticity
we_ordered samosa and_garlic_naan to_start
the pastry was_light and_crispy and_the filling was_perfect
the_naan_was light_and fluffy
for main_courses we_got_a chicken_vindaloo which was_tasty_and well_spiced and_a shrimp mikhani
i_had never_heard_of this_dish and from_the description was_expecting something like_a tikka massala
it_wasn't
it_had sweeter creamier taste
it_was_delicious and_i highly_recommend_it
the_staff also brought_us extra naan_with dinner
this_place_is_a gem and if_you_like_indian_food worth_a trip off_the_strip
i_can't stop going back
for students
all_you_can_eat
why_not
i_love_the chicken_pakora with mint_chutney and the_rice_pudding
stars
slightly better_than average indian_food
and when_you tell them spicy
believe_me
they_make it_spicy
the_staff_is super_friendly and_the_prices_are a_nice break from the_typical overpriced vegas food
and_this_was probably_the_best meal i_had during_my stay_in vegas
and_the cheapest
and_no ditzy waitresses waiters
woot
spicy_and good_quality
my_friend_and_i love_indian_food
i_wanted_to bring some over her house to cheer her up
usually
i_would_have hit namaste
which_is not far_from my work
but they_don't open until
so
i_thought_i would try mint
i_got_the
indian_dinner
honestly
i_can't_say that i_knew all_of_the things that_i_was eating
but yum
stars
came_on saturday for_the_lunch_buffet_and was happy_to walk_in and_see quite a_few tables of_indian patrons
that lets me know_that the_flavors_are authentic and_it_was
even my cousin who spent some_time in_india was_impressed_with the_quality
flavors
and_selection
the_buffet consists of_a mixture_of north and south_indian_dishes
and every_dish tastes so distinct with it's robust spices_and flavors
the_vegetarian_dishes are so_flavorful they_have_the power to convert any carnivore
after devouring full plates
another cousin even made_the comment
i_am willing to become obese for_this
that
in itself
is_a testament to_the deliciousness of mint_bistro
we_actually had_to practice some restraint from consuming the_entire buffet ourselves
we_will_definitely_be_back
we cannot go anywhere in_our travels without trying an_indian_buffet
i_have_not had a_chance_to review the mint_indian_bistro since our last_visit to_vegas
so better late than never
surprisingly
the_experience is
minty
fresh on my_mind so_i still remember the_taste
smells and_excellent hospitality
the_variety_of food_was_excellent and_more that enough choices were presented for meat and_vegetables and_the pakoras_were fresh_and not_overly greasy
i_was both surprised and delighted by_the inclusion of eggplant in_the vegetable_pakora medley
chicken_tika_masala was_superb
and_the_goat curry_was just_like mamma used_to make
i_even liked the_gulab_jamun which_is not_my_favorite dessert
but somehow the_mint made_it very_tasty
i_always feel a_little weird eating with_my hands but_i saw so_many others here doing the_same
so_i dug in and_was up_to my elbows in delicious indian_cuisine
maybe some_things should stay_in vegas
but_not food reviews
especially the_mint
it needs to_be shared and appreciated by one and_all
my_husband_and_i ate_here on_our way_home from vegas
i_looked for_an_indian_restaurant on_yelp with_good reviews_and yelp saved the_day again by leading us_to this wonderful gem
they_have meat
vegetarian_and_vegan options
the_buffet_was huge and_delicious
everything is_clearly labeled whether it's vegan or vegetarian
too
which_was so helpful
i_could only_wish to_find_this wonderful of_a vegan_friendly indian_restaurant_in l
a
i_am on_the hunt
i_will_be eating_here everytime_i visit vegas
dosas
ever_since my beloved bollywood seemed to_take_a turn for_the worse a_couple years_ago
my_husband and_i_decided_to change it_up and_give mint a_try
um
i_may have_been back_here
or
times_since then
they_always start you_off with free
and_yummy
papadum with_mint and_tamarind sauces
their mango_lassis are soooo good_and_the lychee lassi that my_husband randomly tried one_day was pretty_tasty as_well
i'm boring and always_order the_same_thing
saag_paneer
theirs never disappoints
however
and_you_get lots_of paneer which makes_me extra happy
we've also_had_the korma_and saffron cauliflower and_they_are both great_as_well
i_have dreams of the_garlic_naan
i_would_say that the_samosas_are not so_great
and_if i_was rating this by_the buffet_only
and_the vegetarian_food only
i_would_probably give_it stars
maybe non_veg have_a better experience at_the_buffet
but_i'm not_sure
we_wanted_to_try a_new_indian place one sunday_afternoon
but got fed up because_they_are all closed between_the hours of
so we_finally decided_to_go to_our old staple
mint
for_the_buffet
we_had_to laugh because the_place_was jam packed_with indian customers
we said_that all_the_other restaurants must close_to come eat_at mint for_a_late lunch
most days the_food_is_amazing and occasionally it's_just good
some days the
medium
spiciness is_too mild and_sometimes its too_hot
but we've never_had_a bad_experience here_and the_staff_are wonderful and_very_friendly
definitely give_it_a try
and seriously
order a_mango_lassi
note
their_menu specifically states what items_are vegetarian
vegan
and gluten_free
they_even_have vegan lassis
and they_also_have_a great beer_selection
very_good
the_lamb_was moist_and just fell apart in_my_mouth
will visit_again
visiting mint_indian_bistro two weeks in_a row definitely warrants a_review
our_first_visit was_at dinnertime and_we_were utilizing our entertainment book coupon
for_the husband_and_i
we_ordered
karma korma
a creamy_sauce sprinkled with_nuts and assorted himalayan spices
with_fresh veggies
rebel curry
this_is_the nepalese gurkha version_of the famous curry_with a rebelliously inspired exotic blend_of curry spices
with_lamb
garlic_naan
one_thing i_absolutely_love are papadums and was_so pleasantly_surprised when they_offered these to_us complimentary
other_indian_restaurants don't offer it complimentary anymore
both entrees_were so_flavorful and_just delicious that we_couldn't resist checking_out their ever so popular lunch_buffet option
the daily lunch_buffet_is
with kids and under being free
ages to years are
it's offered from
am to
pm
one_thing_i appreciated was that_they noted what food_items were vegetarian_and_vegan
as_someone who recently stopped eating dairy
i_found_this very useful
when_ordering naan
i_was_able_to get this sans butter
which_was quite appreciative in_my situation
and_with my_new dietary restrictions
i_was still able to_enjoy quite a_lot_of_food items and_left feeling full_and satisfied
their_buffet menu can be_found on their_website
but it_does change
overall
we_were_both quite content with their_food
a_la_carte or buffet
definitely one_of_the_better indian_buffets_in town
especially_if you're looking_for_a vegetarian
vegan
or gluten_free menu
good_food
no parking problem
one_of_the_best_indian restaurants_in_vegas
i_had such high hopes for_this_place
my_boyfriend_and_i stopped here_after hearing that_they_had a_lot_of vegan_options on_their_menu
first of_all
it_was freezing inside
so cold that_i had_to_ask_for a_cup_of tea because_i_was getting tired of sitting with goosebumps
we_were_both hungry
and_got the_vegan sampler
i_got_a cup_of tea and_we_got a_side_of_garlic naan
the_garlic_naan wasn't naan
it_was_just flatbread
roti
with way_too much garlic pushed into the_top
neither my_boyfriend nor i_could stomach that_much garlic
and_that's saying a_lot coming_from two garlic fiends
the_vegan sampler was_so small
for
we_were expecting something_to feed two people
it_was_more like for one_person
you_get_a small
cup serving_of vegan_dishes
including cups of cooked white_rice
it_was_not enough by_any_means
it was_supposed_to come with_a_side_of coconut sorbet
but_it never_came
we_were_told they_had replaced it with_the
carrot pudding
that_was on_our sampler
we_didn't want that
we_wanted the_coconut sorbet
so disappointed
way_too expensive for_the_amount_of_food you_get
my_bill of
shouldn't have left us leaving still hungry
my tea cost
for_one tea bag
never going back
a_group_of friends_and i_have_a food club
where_we get together every two weeks and_take turns picking new restaurants to_try
being a_huge indian_food fan
i_was ecstatic to hear that someone had finally picked an_indian_restaurant
the_service we_received was_great
my_friend_had informed the_owner what_it_was we were_doing
and_he_was more_than accommodating
he sat down_with us_and we_were_able_to talk_to him about_the restaurant_which is_really_nice
the_food
however
was_so disappointing
two_of_us split the_indian_sampler
as_it_was advertised that_it_was
perfect_for two to_share or one_to feast on
naturally
i_was_expecting a_bunch_of food
to_my disappoint
when_the platter came out it_was nothing more_than barely a_half cup_of each_item
it_was_not enough to_satisfy one persons' hunger
let alone enough_for two to_share
we_had even ordered an_extra side_of naan
it_was sad_to say
we_had more naan than food to_eat_it with
it's_a sad
sad day when that happens
i_will_say
their mango_lassi_was good
a majority_of my group was_disappointed
just as_i_was
in_the_food to price proportions
although
many of_them left full
unlike myself the_price they paid_for the_food_wasn't sitting too well_with them
but who can blame em
my_friend_and_i spent about dollars between_the two_of_us
to_leave the_place completely dissatisfied and hungry
needless_to say
when_we_left the_restaurant
the_first_place i headed to was_the jack in_the box in_the_same parking_lot
and_then i_went_to mint_indian_bistro in_las_vegas
i_tend_to be quite the elitist when_it_comes_to indian_food
because_i come from a_family in_the indian_restaurant business
my aunt and grandmother have_a joint in_the_valley
la
which i_will_not review because that_would_be biased
i'm cool like_that
in_any case
this_place_is_the jam when_it_comes_to indian_food
seriously
i_walked_in with my_parents
since_we_were in_the_mood for_a spicy
delicious feast
i hopped on_yelp_and saw reviews from my_friends matthew c
misti y
adina c
jade w
and the_list goes on
these_are friends in real life
so_i_know their star reviews are legit
the_restaurant_is nice
very_nice
clean
dimly lit
large booths
very comfortable chairs
and_the aroma of_indian_food is_in_the air
it's like_a wet dream that_you never wake up_from
until you_are done with_your_meal
pay the_bill and_walk out the_door
the_menu_is quite diverse for_an_indian joint
they_have south_indian fare like dosas
bhel_puri and_the like
you also_have choices of nepali inspired dishes
tend_to be_on_the spicier side
when_you place your_order
the_server punches everything into an iphone
kudos for_being high tech
we_ordered_the daal tarka
yellow lentils full order
the nepali chili_chicken
spicy
and the_malai_kofta
half order
some roti
and_rice
love_the papad
and_chutneys that magically show up before your_food
now earlier
i_went_on and_on about_how this_was_a wet dream of_a_restaurant
the_food_was the_one tugging at you
definitely_the star of_the show
the_chicken blew my_mind
so_great
and_was like_a sensual symphony in_my face
although_i asked_for_it spicy
he probably thought_i couldnt handle it
it_came_out medium
which might be_spicy to those_of you lacking melanin
who cares
it_was fucking unreal
so_delicious
the_daal was_perfect
not too_much in spice
so you_really got the_flavor_of the_lentils
the_full portion is_quite large
go_with_a half
malai_kofta
this_was fantastic too
typically restaurants will use_a heavy cream in_the recipe
and this_dish can_be unnecessarily unhealthy and heavy
the subtle hint_of coconut milk helped make_this a_fantastic item on_the_menu
yes
ladies and gentlemen of yelp
this_place_is_a star indian_restaurant
i_am coming back
many
many_times
aside from_the restaurant_in my_family
and india_palace in memphis
tn
this is_the_best_indian_restaurant
i've ever dined at
and
i_am indian
don't waste_your time_at gandhi
origin india
mt
everest or others
mint
mint
mint
my_friends_and_i decided not_to go_to_a buffet
because one_of us_was a_vegetarian
we_ordered_the indian_sampler and_another dish_for of_us
everything was_so_delicious and_filling
yumm
i_went_here with some_friends during_our recent vegas stay
it_was_really awesome
going_to vegas
people always rave about_the_food
but_i've never_really found anything food wise that i_cant live without
i_am_a vegetarian for almost years now and_most buffets_are meat seafood heavy and_i just don't_see the_value in paying_for salad
that_makes indian_food a_really attractive option_for me
i_was with other_people and_we settled on_indian after a_little_bit_of back_and forth negotiations
i_am really glad_we did
first
its a_little off_the_strip so parking was easy_to find
coming with_people isn't always easy to_accommodate without reservations but mint was_more_than accommodating
we_had excellent_service
we_had_a free appetizer_and our glasses_were always filled before_we had_to_ask
the_menu_was fairly extensive
there were_a_lot_of options
including many_of_the traditional_indian favorites
naan
kormas
masalas
etc
the_portions_were generous
served quickly_and hot
my veggie_korma was_really_good
all_around everyone_was very_happy_with the_dishes they ordered
some_of_the items we_ordered included
veggie_korma
lamb_korma
naan garlic_and plain
rice
dinner special menu set
mango_lassis
and chicken_masala
the_korma was smooth and_not gritty
gritty korma_is a pet peeve of_mine
the_dinner set came_in traditional metal serving trays with_many little sides
they_didn't make_a fuss in_my request to substitute of_the_meat options_for vegetarian_options
the_vegetables were cooked correctly and_not mushy overcooked
the_spice_level was low for_me but_i also_have_a very high spice tolerance
everyone else seemed_to think_it_was around medium_spicy
we split_the check_in
which they_didn't give us any heartache about
i'd_recommend it_as_a nice
calm place_to_get a_solid
tasty
dinner while in_vegas especially if_you_have_a larger group_and don't_want_to fight with_the long lines at buffets
also mint_is really vegetarian_friendly
all in_all
a_great_experience
very_good_food
excellent_service
i'm planning on coming_back_for the_lunch_buffet
if_you_ask
you_can get gluten_free roti
bread
made_from buckwheat
also our_waiter asked_how spicy i_wanted my dishes
which i_thought_was great
i_got and_it_was_pretty darn hot_and i_like_it spicy
an_interesting mix if indian_and nepalese_food
it's_a_small place in_a_strip_mall but worth_trying
the_service_is_friendly and_we met one_of_the_owners
or managers
who_was from the_bay_area and chatted about indian_restaurants back_home
tikka_masala_and butter_chicken are tasty_but not_at the_level_of my_favorite in sf
mehfil
best_i've_had_in vegas so_far
i_don't typically write review updates this quick
nor do_i usually write another star_review for_a_place i_absolutely_love
there's no point in beating a dead horse
but_i popped in_for_the_lunch_buffet at mint_indian_bistro with my_dad yesterday and_it blew my_mind
indian_lunch_buffets are_usually pretty sketch
in_most cases
it's the_food leftover from_the night before
and_it's obvious
not the_case here
every single item in the_line was_fresh
delicious
and_tasted as_if had_been made right there and_then
i_know this because i_had_been here_for_dinner just_a_couple weeks back
so_i_could judge accordingly
i_sampled a_little_bit_of_everything
the_chili_chicken
the_tikka_masala
chicken pakorda
saag
daal tarka
the idli sambar
mmmmmm
for bucks
this_really is_the_best lunch in_all_of las_vegas
you_get_a ton_of_food and_it's delicious
if_you_have vegan or vegetarian friends
there_are_plenty_of options_in the_buffet_line as_well
everything is_clearly marked
so_there is_no hanky panky
service_was_great
just_like last time
i_can't_wait_to come_back
in closing
no need_to worry_about the_lunch_buffet here
it's_just as_good_as_the a_la cart menu
feel free to_eat your meals with_your hands
and use_the bathrooms afterwards to wash up
the bathrooms are spotless here
overall
great_indian_food at_a reasonable_price
my_boyfriend and_i_had_a hankering for_indian_food the_last_time we_were in_vegas_and with_all_the good reviews_on_yelp we_decided_to_try the_indian mint_bistro
when we_placed our_order the_server_was playing with_his iphone while taking our drink_orders
i_thought_this was_a_bit rude but_he explained that_they_have an_app to_place orders
pretty_cool
we_started off_with_a salty mango_lassi which_was_delicious
for_our_main course we_ordered_the indian_sampler
that featured garlic_naan
veg pakodas
chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
tandoori_chicken
mixed veg curry
lentils
yogurt
rice
and_a milky rice_pudding
khir
we_liked the_idea_of having a_little taste_of everything_and boy did we
the food_was_outstanding
but_the servings were kind of small
i_was satisfied
but my_boyfriend could_have eaten more
they_did bring_out more rice when_they saw we_were getting low
tip
they_also serve halal meats_and they_will call a_cab for_you when your_meal is over
ahhh
las_vegas
being from another city
i imagined the_entire culinary landscape bereft of anything not bearing crab legs or all_you_can_eat prime rib
i'm not_sure why_i had_this thought
but_i_did
i admit it
however
thanks_to the aggregated ratings and reviews_of my_fellow internet users
my_wife_and_i discovered_this assumption shattering tastiness
it's_a_great location
away from_the_strip
and the_interior_is classy and understated
though to_be fair
being understated is easy_to do in_a city full_of flashing lights and incessant beeping
sure
we_waited a_bit
but_it_was saturday_night
the_food more_than made_up_for_it
we_had_a sampler platter
which_came_with garlic_nan
delicious tandoori_chicken
daal
biryani
and_yogurt
everything_was prepared_with delicacy and care
and_as_a regular consumer of_indian_food
i was_more_than pleased with_the_quality
next_time i_go_back
i_will have to_try_out some_of_the nepalese selections available
they looked amazing
significantly more enticing than endless prime rib
it was_kind_of freaky walking_in at
pm to an_empty restaurant
but_we braved it_and stayed
and_it_was wonderfully yummy
like sara m
i_also thought our_waiter_was being kind of rude playing with_his phone when_he approached our_table to_take_our_order
but_i realized he_was using his phone for ordering
what_a cute little trick
i'm glad_i refrained from scolding him before_i knew what_he was_doing
because_i know you never want_to piss off your waiter before_you get_your food
we_had_the normal stuff garlic_naan
saag_paneer
and chicken_tikka_masala_and a_large kingfisher
all_was so_great
we_are looking_forward_to coming back next year
the_only disappointment was_that the_naan_was not part_of_the_meal
we_had_to order_it separately
and_they gave_us_a double order because we_both said naan
we_ate lots_of naan
'erp
and_the_restaurant did get busier
more tables walked_in after us
it_was_a monday
after_all
service_was extremely polite as_well
we hope to_see you next year
mint
so please don't close
great_service_and food_was_fantastic
lunch_buffet is_a_bit small
but well_worth_it
definitely one_of_my_favorite lunch spots
not_worth the trouble
the_wait here_is crazy and_the_service_is mediocre
the_food_was_good
although spicier_than i_am_used_to
i_think_i'll stick_with india_palace instead
they_have better_food and_better service
our absolute favorite lunch spot
we_go almost every_week and it's_always busy and_delicious
the_naan is_amazing_and the_lunch_buffet_is amazing
we_will miss our weekly indian_food lunch
love the_buffet
have_not ordered anything from_the_menu
but really_love the_buffet too_much to_try anything else
the_food_is_great
and i_love_the fusion of
what_i believe to_be chow mein with tandoor chicken and_spices
everything tastes fresh
and the_service_is_friendly
a_must_try if you enjoy indian_buffets
i_went into this_place mainly because_it_was not_too far away from_my hotel and a_quick glance of reviews that told_me that_this_place was_going_to_be ok
this_place serves a_combination of_indian_and nepali food
nepali food gets branded as indian_food even_though_i feel that nepali food_is more lamb_and lentil
pulse
based
i loved_their unique drink menu
i_don't_think_i have_seen spiked lassis before_and that definitely was the_highlight_of my eating activity there
we_ordered sambosas for appetizer followed by a_few vegetarian entries
food overall tasted real good_and_the spice_level was_almost to_the level we_ordered
one_was ordered spicy_and was_mostly spicy and_the_other was mild
i_will_definitely stop_here on my_next trip_to_vegas
another lunch_for please
i_went_here on_a_tuesday for_the
lunch_buffet
i_got
basmati_rice
good
garlic_naan
good
chicken_tikka_masala
cubed chicken_breast was_a_bit on_the dry side
chicken tandori
flavorful
chicken pakoda
basically battered
fried_chicken
i_can't remember_the_name_of the noddles i_had
but_they_were vegetarian_and super_spicy
all in_all
it_was alright
good_variety_of items
with descriptions of_what sauces they would_go well_with and_if they_were vegan vegetarian
mint_indian_bistro is an_interesting spot
it's not_like most_indian_places i'm_used_to
a_little_more upscale
a_little_more gourmet
a_little_more
well
different
my paradigm for_indian_food is
in_general
that the_best_food comes from_the dingiest places so_a proportionally inverse relationship between_the fanciness of the_decor_and the_quality_of_the_food
from_the standpoint of taste
when_i_walked in to_mint i immediately formed an impression about what_i was_going_to eat
and_i_was not_too surprised in_the_end
just glad to_have_some decent_indian_food since_i come from a_place_that has none
the_food_at mint falls into_the higher end category better meats
obviously more hand made sauces
etc
not_as dirty
earthy
pungent
and 'street' as_the style that_really rocks my socks
but it's_good nonetheless
and sticks fairly well to form as_being actual indian and_not fusion
which_is_what i_tend_to see at higher end indian_places
i_sampled the_chicken_vindaloo
which at a_half order contained a surprising amount of tender
succulent chicken but_not_the same amount of potatoes that i'm_used_to
it_has_a decent heat to_it but_not quite the
fiery descent
that's comically described on_the_menu
the_saag_paneer is quite_nice
with_a less 'spinach y' flavor than i'm_used_to
a much_more subtle and balanced version_of the heady green beast
the_name_of our third curry escapes me_a blond affair with veggies
nice_and creamy_and delicious probably my_favorite of_the three
paired up_with a_bowl_of basmati_rice_and a_basket_of roti
half sized
oz
dishes makes for_a beyond filling meal_for two
props for offering half size portions
if only the_price were half too
the_drinks list is mighty impressive
with_a very extensive beer_selection
some fun cocktails including a_whole spate of flavored lassi offerings
and_of_course wine
my rose vodka lassi_was interesting
tasted like rose
and_the_mango rum is exactly what you'd_expect
three half plates
roti_and two lassi cocktails came_to a sum total of
kind of a_lot for_the_amount_of_food
but definitely_a higher quality_of ingredients than i'm_used_to seeing in the_street indian i_usually seek out
the_experience
including_the impeccable service
also adds in_to the_value
papadam to_start
clean plates to transition from papadam to meal
and constantly full waters
this_is_probably the largest departure from_the dirty hole in_the_wall spots i hit in sf for_my sub continent fix
i'd_definitely come_back after spending some_more time exploring indian_options in_lv
i_love the_lunch_buffet
tons_of food_and_i like_that_they bring_out fresh_naan
the_chicken_masala and_basmati_rice are my_favorites
the_only_thing_that is lacking is_true raita
they_have yogurt_sauce but it's_just_not the_same
so_i have_to_go to_india_palace for_my raita fix
still very_good
friendly prompt service
every so often i hopefully check to_see_if has reopened and end_up here
it_does quite nicely
delicious
interesting selection_of_indian and belgian beers
gluten_free and_vegetarian vegan_options
chicken_vindaloo and buttered naan highly_recommended
friendly_and_attentive service
eh
nothing screams
i_must come_back_here
was_anything wrong
not_really
was_anything great
yes
fresh_naan of your_choice
but_now do we_go_to indian_restaurants for_the_naan alone
no
they have_a_lot_of vegan choices on_the_buffet
which_i certainly wasn't there_for
i enjoyed_their version_of chicken_tikka_masala
it_was lighter
had chunks_of tomato in_it
i_didn't_feel super guilty eating_it
my_husband did_not like_it as_much as_the creamier versions
i_enjoyed_the chicken chili
nice_and_spicy
first_time_i ever_had chicken chili at_an_indian_restaurant
the_restaurant_was clean
with newer furniture
so anyhow
we_will not be_back
there_are at least two_other indian_restaurants_in_vegas that my_husband_and_i prefer
check_it_out if you_feel_like it
if_you_don't
no loss
food_was_good
but_the_service took forever
portions weren't very big either was_excited_to go after_reading all the_reviews
and instead got on the_road back_to cali pretty late and_still hungry
maybe save this_place_for_a night you're still in_vegas instead_of on_the_way out
stopped by mint based_on_the reviews_here while in_vegas
interesting menu
want_it with meat
vegan
just vegetarian
just ask
so_i tried some_things i_don't usually order_at other_indian_restaurants a noodle dish called chau_chau
rebel chicken_curry
and dal soup
everything was_very_good very_different mix_of spices than i'm_used_to at other_indian_restaurants
and obviously freshly prepared
the only_negative was_that one_person in my_party ordered channa_masala mild
and it_came_out quite_spicy
and_she wimped out and_didn't send it_back
it was_a_good_experience for_me_and my_family
we tried_the_lunch_buffet
the_food_was_good_and was_quite cheap
i_never really_had indian_food_in_vegas
but wanted to_try_some nice_place
the_reviews for_this_place and tamba were_nice
but wanted_to find_some place off_the_strip and_with easy parking so picked mint
the_place_looks little shady from outside
the plaza was dark and_the_restaurant did_not seem very brightly lit from outside
but_don't worry it's a_great_place from inside
the_decor_is nice_and upscale
it's_a quite place
with comfortable seating
the lights could_be brighter
there_were few_other table's occupied
all by indians
a_good sight if_you_are looking_for true indian spicy_food and_not tamed down_for the american population
the_waiter_was nice
pleasant and_took out his iphone while talking to_us
realized within minutes he_was noting down our_order with an_app from the_app store
also said_they own a software company and are_going to_start using their own app in some_time
coming_to the_main part
food
it_was_really_good
we_ordered mint lassi_and masala chhas
both_were very indian_and really_tasty
their_menu_is very_well organized
great_for vegetarians_and vegans since each_item says if its_good for_vegetarians or vegans
very_happy to_see_how they describe each_item in_the_menu really_well
one_of_the best organized menu's among all restaurants
comparing to all_indian
american etc
restaurants
for the_main_course we_ordered paneer makhani
daal makhani_and chole with naans
everything was_really_good
daal was_very_tasty
although_the color might make_you think its not_the_best
but trust_me the_taste is_nothing short_of what_you find back_home
naan's were also_very_good
they_also have nepalese_food but did_not try_it
but would_love_to try_that too
overall_great place_if_you are_looking_for true indian_food
would_definitely go_back again
i_only like this_place_because i_am indian_and they_serve good authentic_indian_food
haha
nice_decor
ok service
example
we_ordered extra rice_and our_waiter forgot about us and_we had_to_ask the_next waiter who wandered by minutes later if he_could bring_us some
tasty_food
i'm not_too sure on_the value as my_husband_and_i shared the_indian_sampler plate which_was all pretty_tasty
but wasn't exactly a_ton_of_food for_two_people
even_though_the menu indicated it_would_be plenty
but maybe i'm_just used_to having tasty leftovers to_take_home when_i_go out for_indian
hmm
i'm gonna have_to update my_review after_i try_the_buffet
because i've heard good_things
for now
mint remains a_solid option_for indian_food_in_vegas
but_nothing really mind blowing
if_you_are in_vegas_and looking for_indian_food_and don't_go here you're_not living life correctly
went_for_lunch buffet
it's great
lots_of food_selection
they_even_have lamb and_it's cook and seasoned nicely
and_different kind of_hot soup
they only_thing_that i_didn't_like about the_naan_is that it's_a_bit under cooked
looks really white and_i_like my_naan to_be brown
slightly burned
i went_there_for launch
their service_was_very_good
they greet and sit me right away_and cleared the empty dishes of my_table every_time_i had finished unlike many_places that let it linger there forever
although_it_was a_buffet
the_food_was fresh_and_tasty
they_offered good_selection_of vegetarian_and meet items
in_general the_atmosphere in_that place_is_good
i_will_go_back
i_gave them only four_stars because i_went_for their launch buffet not dinner
therefore
it_will_be wrong for_me to_give_them full credit
but_i might will
after i'll go there_for_dinner
we_made a_reservation last_night for pm on_the opentable app while_we_were out running errands
when_we_arrived
every table_was full_and the_manager expressed that_he thought_the reservation was_for
i pulled up_the email and_he apologized profusely
they seated_us to_the side with menus while_they figured out where to_put us
the_manager continuously apologized and we_were_seated within minutes of_our reservation
with drinks
which we_ordered while_we_were waiting
and papadum arriving quickly
my_husband is_still coming_to terms with_indian_food
he_was convinced he hated it_when what_he really dislikes is curry
so he's been slowly discovering things_that aren't curry
so_we_ordered the_indian_sampler to_give him the widest range_of options
at_least_one other reviewer suggested that_this wasn't enough_food for_two
but we_found it_to_be more_than worthwhile
true
there_were_no leftovers
but that_isn't what we_were expecting
the tray is artfully presented
each_item comes_in its own small
circular metal container with_naan in_the center and extra rice on_the side
the containers are easy to_pick_up
which_is really useful when sharing
there_isn't really enough naan for_two
but our_second order came out fast_and warm
everything expect the_vegetable_curry was_a_little mild for_my_taste
but_that_was the_price i paid_for sharing with someone who asked_for medium
i_had_the lychee rum lassi
i_really_like_the idea_of alcoholic lassis
but_the lychee flavor was_a_little mild
i_think_i'll start_with a stronger base flavor next_time
lychee was_too delicate
i had_the_lunch_buffet a_while ago_and came_back based on_that
it_was_definitely worth_it
they_did rush us_out without be drink menu i_asked_for after we_finished our khir
but_when i_saw_the grandmas in saris sitting outside in_a line about five tables deep
i_decided that_my darjeeling would_be just_as_good brewed at_home
they_were apparently the_place_to be_on christmas eve
i_came_here for_the great_lunch_buffet we_have_been hearing about on_yelp
let me say_it is_true
great_service_and a_great line of_food
the salads were_great
but do_not be tricked with the_spiciness_of some_of_the peppers
i_was tricked by thinking it_was_a bell pepper
but_after five minutes of crying
i_have learned my lesson to chew more no matter how hungry you_are
the_curries_were delectable
the_goat was especially wonderful
the soups were_good
my_favorite_was_the tomato
the_others made me_feel like_it_was lacking something
the naan_was_great
the misses liked the_garlic one while i_liked_the original
although_we came early
before they_opened
they let us come inside away_from_the cold_and sit while_they finished preparing the_buffet_for us
the_service_was wonderful
i_love how their menus have descriptions of_everything
from the_ingredients to the_drinks to_the little anecdotes about_how particular drinks_were not_really indian
when_i come_back_to vegas and_i_am craving_indian
i_am coming_back_to this_place_again
if_you_like_indian_food
you_must try_this_place out
best_indian_lunch_buffet you'd every get for

the_variety is unbelievable
including several chicken_and_lamb dishes but_also many_vegetarian ones
i've never seen an_indian_buffet with_that big of_a spread
there_is_also a salad_bar
everything_was_delicious
the_garlic_naan was_out_of_this_world
the_chicken_curry_and fried_chicken
strip
were very_yummy and_the_chicken tandoori_was the_best_i've_ever_had
they_even_have desserts
love
love_this_place
you_will

dinner review
excellent staff humble
paid the_right_amount_of attention_to me
excellent_food
i_had_the sauteed cauliflower and_potato vegetarian dish
try_the esh
a german beer a_strong beer with_a very smooth taste
simply just delicious_indian_food
the_owner kris is very_attentive
unbelievably great_indian_restaurant
hip
classy
reasonably_priced
and the_food_is_outstanding
everything_in this_place_is really_well put together
even the_menu_is a_delight to_read
the beverage section says something like
while we're waiting_for the himalayan snow to melt
perhaps you'd enjoy some_of our other water selections
the_indian_sampler was so_tasty
with a_wide_variety_of dishes_and perfect proportions
the_perfect dish for_a first date
the_mango_lassi_was flavorful_but not_too_sweet
the organic tomato_soup is unlike any tomato_soup i've ever_had
the_owner stopped by our_table
and_it_was clear how_much pride and_thought he_had put into the_restaurant
i plan_to return_to mint_indian_bistro every_time i_go_back to_las_vegas
the_food_here_is absolutely_delicious
i_highly_recommend_the lunch_buffet
since you get_to_try so_many of their_dishes
as_a_vegetarian semi vegan
i_also appreciate the_variety_of veg options available
as_well_as_the labels they_have on_the_buffet_line noting if foods are_vegetarian or vegan
the_staff_is_very nice as_well
recently my_boyfriend_and_i arrived just before the_lunch_buffet_was scheduled to_close
but they_said we could_do the_buffet anyway
and_even brought_us some vegan naan
solid stars
is_nice to get_away from_the_strip if you're there for_an entire week
the_ambiance here is_great
very calm and the_service_is_great
they_are_so high tech
the_waiter took our_orders with_his iphone and_it_was submitted into the_kitchen
he said the_owner created an_app
genius
you_can never_go wrong_with tikka_masala
we_came_here for_dinner_with a_party_of five
no_buffet a_la_carte
we_ordered an assortment_of dishes
but my_favorite_was_the tikka_masala_with garlic_naan
i_also_ordered the peach lassi
which was_pretty_good
it_tasted_like a peach yoplait
hahaha
oh
i_forgot to_mention
but they_have_a_great
extensive selection_of alcoholic beverages
the_best_indian_food_i've_had in_las_vegas so_far
don't_get_me_wrong
mint bistro's food_is not_the_best_indian_food one can_find
but_well above
for instance
gandhi indian_bistro
which is_just_a short distance to the_west
four_stars is_probably a_little_high for_the_food
more_like three and_one half
the cons
in_every chicken_dish that_i've tried
the_chicken is overcooked
i routinely expect that_in chicken_tandoori
but_not in tikka_masala
or_even the_chicken chili at mint_bistro
additionally
the_food_is definitely toned down_for american tastes
i_have_to load up_on the_chili paste at_the salad_bar
i_do the recommend the_chutneys here
all of_them but especially the_mint and_coconut chutneys
the_service_and smiles on the_staff merit five_stars
i_like_to see happy people in_a_restaurant
that makes_me believe the_management cares enough_to consistently produce a_good product
finally
the beer_selection is_very_good
though for_some odd reason
mint_bistro carries no american beers
not_even some_of_the premium micro brews
i definitely_recommend mint_bistro and_my criticisms are_only offered in_the hope that the_management will strive to_improve the minor deficiencies i_have listed
this_place_is not_to shabby
went_for_the_lunch_buffet which_was_good
the_quality_of_the_food was_pretty_good
the_service_was_great
wish_they had more_of_a variety
meaning not the_same type_of food everyday
ate_here about different times
the_naan here seems_to be doughy
its_a thick piece
im not_sure if_they make_it like_this because_they_are from a_different region but_i've had_some where it_was_more on_the thinner side
wouldn't mind coming_here again
definitely enjoyed_my food_here
lunch_buffet_is relishing here
each_dish has its own richness
also
versatile range_of buffet dishes allows you pamper your cravings to_the core
right from the_ambience to_the_food
its worth to_be there
good work
this_is a_nice_little indian_restaurant not far from_the_strip
the_decor_is hip
the workers are polite
and the_lunch_buffet_is delicious
the_price_is
and_they usually_have a_good_variety_of indian_dishes
if they_have tikka_masala
it_is usually watered_down
but everthing else_is good
especially_the chicken_pakora
i_like_the salad area
where they_have_some nice chutneys
the_nan is_good
but they_don't always ask if_you_want more
and_sometimes they_get busy and_don't refill your water
and if_you_have_a burn going
that could_be dangerous
of all_the_indian_restaurants near the_strip
this_is probably_the_best
this_place can_get full very fast
because_it_is small
parking_is not so_good
as_it_is in_a busy little strip of stores
they open at
enjoy
this_place wasn't mint when_i originally reviewed it_so it_isn't fair that they_get the_reviews grandfathered to_them when this business was_called
himalayan something something
decent buffet
stars_if you_eat meat but if_you_don't
they_do offer a_few unique dishes i_don't_see at any_other_indian buffet like_their version_of lo mein
chaat and kinds_of naan_and soup
i_just prefer_the overall selection a_little_more at_other_places
move over namaste there_is_a new indian_buffet champ in_town or_maybe i'm_just way_too late discovering
i_knew i_was_in_the right place when_we_walked_in to_a filled up buffet_at pm saturday
hall full_of indians
they_brought us_a pitcher of_water and_asked what_kind_of naan we'd like between regular
butter
or_garlic
i_know a_few places_that bring_your naan fresh table side but_this_is the_first that offers you_a selection
their_buffet selections also provided some refreshing new items such_as the their_chicken chili
a saag which wasn't your standard spinach but_a combination_of flavorful veggies
and_a ridciculously tasty goat_curry which_i proceeded_to get plates_of
i passed out_for hours after_eating their_buffet and can't_wait_to use my restaurant
com_coupon for_dinner as you_can't use for_their_lunch_buffet
i_was thoroughly impressed_with their_buffet and know dinner will only be_better
definitely check_it_out
came_here ny day to_celebrate my_friends engagement
kind of_a random location
but_not far_from the tuscany
which i_love
had_the_lunch_buffet and_everything_was very_good
there_were also a_lot_of_indian people
so_you_know that's a_good_sign too
they_have a_little_bit_of_everything to suit all tastes and spice_levels
i_love_the mint
not_much to_say_that hasn't already been said
many_vegetarian and_vegan_options
and labelled as such
the_menu itself_is an enjoyable read very cleverly written
my most recent visit was_on valentines day
when they_had_a pre fixe menu which_was_a four course meal_with several options_for each course
at per_person
not including drinks
this_was_a more expensive meal than the_usual dinner_here
if anything
there_was too_much_food
but i_love leftovers_for breakfast
so_i'm okay with_that
the_meal_was delicious as_always
the_waitstaff friendly and_prompt especially considering how slammed they_were on_this big dining out night
two special little treats were_the rose mintini a slightly sweet
rose flavored cocktail that_was_a perfect compliment to_the spicy fare and_the kulfi
which_was_a cardamom flavored cross between rice_pudding_and ice_cream
extremely rich_and flavorful
it_was served_in tiny cups
but_was creamy_and wonderful_and just the_perfect treat to_end a_lovely meal
my_husband_and_i went_here_for valentine's day while in_las_vegas
we_were blown_away with how amazing our night_was
the_service_is nonpareil
before_we even arrived at_the_restaurant
someone gave_us_a call to_let us_know that the_menu_was prix fixe and_wanted_to let us_know that we_can look on the_website to_make_sure that_we_were still interested
and
once there
the_staff_were all very_attentive_and we_didn't have_to_wait long for_any of_our courses to_come
there_are many vegetarian_options and_each course was
quite easily
the_best_indian_food that we've ever_had
the_mango_lassi is_also quite enjoyable
we_will_definitely always come_back_to mint whenever we're in_the_area
this_restaurant_is a_gem
the daily brunch is a_steal
it includes a_variety_of meat vegetarian_entrees from throughout india_and nepal
while many others already have reviewed this_restaurant
since this_is possibly my_favorite_restaurant
i_wanted_to add my applause
taj_palace is_still my_favorite although this_is_the_only comparison i_have
mint doesnt have as_many vegetarian_options as taj_palace who offers about options including_a salad_bar
i_was_disappointed that mint didnt offer any lentil dishes and_the_naan wasn't_as great_as everyone posted
my fianc who_is the meat_eater wasn't_too fond of_the goat_curry_and prefers taj palaces chicken_tiki_masala
overall
it_was a_good_place_to try for_indian_food_and was_crowded for saturday lunch_buffet so that_has to_say something but we'll stick_to taj_palace for_our indian fix
great_place_to sit down and_enjoy great_quality food
new_menu and_great selections are now available
was_not_too impressed_with_the service this_time
usually pretty_good yet today was_rather disappointed
very_good_food and_prompt service
lamb khorma is_amazing
waiter had exceptional recommendations and_could explain the_spicy index to my_wife
ask about_the beers bc they_are unique
out_of all_the_indian_restaurants in the_las_vegas area this_one_is my_favorite
i_have_never_had a_dish that_i_didn't love and_service has_always been_great
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
tons_of vegetarian_and_vegan options
tons_of chicken_and_lamb options
if_you_have never_tried_indian_food
there_are several options that_will get_you introduced to_it with familiar flavors
they_really do_have something_for everyone
they_have easy_to read descriptions and_so many_different flavors to_choose and_love
they_only think that_isn't stars_is the cocktail menu
the descriptions are_nice but the_flavor is just_ok
stick_to the virgin lassi or their nice beer_selection for better options
it_has_been fairly or very quiet every_time_i have_gone and the_service_is_always friendly_and excellent
you_can control the_spice of your_food as_well on_a to scale
i_usually_go with_an or depending on_the dish
good spice with excellent flavor
great_for_a date_night or to_try somewhere new
food_is every_time
drinks are_to and_service has_been every_time so_a it_is for_being the best_indian_food_in_vegas
the_food_was_pretty_good
the_dosa and nan were_very_good
the_lamb_vindaloo_and chicken_tiki_masala were_just okay
certainly_not bad_but not_the_best i_have_tried for_sure
the_service_was_very slow
it_took minutes_from when_we_ordered to_get_our food
that's_not an exaggeration
we had_dinner at_mint tonight and it_was_amazing
we had_a_few items
potato_and pea samosas these_were ok
a_little_too much seasoning for_my_liking
vindaloo
chicken thighs
full portion very_good with_a tomato base
it_was_a_great recommendation by the_waiter
tikka_masala
chicken
our_favorite this_was_the_best tikka_masala we have_ever_had
it was_absolutely_delicious
we_also_had_a full portion_of this
garlic_naan also so_yummy
between all_of this_food
my_hubby and_i_were stuffed
we_could_have even passed on the_samosas_and been more_than full
the_staff_was also very_attentive
and_although the_restaurant_was packed
we_only waited about_minutes for_a_table
overall
thanks yelpers for_all_the great_reviews
it_was_a fantastic choice for_dinner
best_indian_buffet_in las_vegas_and top ten in the_country yes indeed
good_selection but much_more authentic than the_usual buffet fare and_the honey ball desert is_to_die_for
did_i_mention the endless naan
this_place_was so_good
the_decor_was chic and_the_service staff was_very_nice_and helpful
the_menu_was huge
sometimes a_bad sign
but_everything we_ordered every_dish that passed our_table looked and smelled delicious
we_had_been craving_indian_food
so before_we stepped foot in_the_restaurant
we already knew_we were_going_to order momo and_chicken_tikka_masala
lucky for_us
wednesday happened_to be chicken_tikka_masala night
which_means if_we bought one
we'd get_the nd one half off
you_can choose the_level_of spiciness you prefer
along_with the_naan
this meal really hit_the_spot
i'm_not from_the area
but i_will_definitely come_back_here anytime i'm_in_vegas again just to_try_more tasty dishes
especially those on_the prix fixe menu
their_buffet was_the_best amongst all in_the sin city
ambience_and service_was_good_and timely
i_am_from nj and an_indian
nj has large indian population
but_there_are only_two restaurants_that are_good
i moved_to lv two_years ago_and i_had_been trying_out different indian_restaurants for sometime
when_i_went to_mint for first_time_i thought that_this_was best_indian_restaurant_in lv apart from namaste
i_just could_not believe_that i've not written a_review on_this
so
here_is my_experience from last weekend
last weekend i_went_to mint with my_friends_and my gf
some of_them had never_been_to indian_restaurant
they_were excited to_try_it_out
so_we_ordered the_following
shrimp khadhai
chicken_tikka
lamb rebel curry
butter naan
my gf's favorite
bhathura
daal mahkhni
lentils
chicken_biryani
fried_rice
chaat appetizer
we_ordered everything very_spicy and_it_was_delicious
specially the_shrimp khadhai
my_mouth is watering just writing about_it
also
the_free basmati_rice that comes_with the_curries is_very delicious_and smells amazing
all the_curries_were amazing
the_chicken_biryani was little over cooked
but_it_was spiced well
my only_complaint that_i_would have_is that_their full size portions_are very_small
and_their full size portions_are way smaller than_their some restaurant's half sized
now_i know its a_good trick to_get_your customers to_buy more_food
but_i_think they_should be_honest on_their serving size
final bill_was plus tip for_people
not that_bad
but_we_had to_order more_food and we_did_not order any alcohol
positives
delicious_food
good ambiance
negatives
prices seem unreasonably high_for the_quantity of_food
i_guess that's_what happenes when a_restaurant gets famous
overall
its just_as_good as namaste if_not better
p
s
their_lunch_buffet_is good
but_its not_as_good when_you_order of_the_menu
good_food lunch_buffet has food value
staff_is helpful_and polite
worth_trying
everytime_i drive out to_vegas i_have_to stop_here
bar none
the_best_indian_food_i've_ever had and_well
i'm a_vegetarian
i_eat a_lot_of_indian food
the greatest thing_is they_have all regions of_indian_food so
you_don't_have to_pick just_one
you_can_have them_all
plus
the_wait_staff_is super_nice_and willing to chat_with you about_the_food
it's_a_little bit_pricey
but_even for_the frugalest person it's worth_every stinkin penny
the_place smells great when you_go inside
some_of_the best tarka dal i_have_ever_had
my karia was_good
not spicy_enough my_friend_had chicken vinaloo which_was_also tasty
the_service_was at_a glacial pace
my fave spot
we_love their_buffet options
they cater_to your needs and_service_was superb
i_have_yet_to try_their dosa buffet_on sundays
maybe soon
hands down
mint_indian_bistro is_the_best indian_food_in_vegas
i'm originally from sf
i'm indian
and_have_been searching_for a_good_indian_restaurant in_vegas_for years
mint has authentic
fresh
some organic
and most_importantly
amazing flavors that give_me the_perfect curry fix
if_i'm too lazy to_cook myself
the_service_and team there_is_also very_nice_and attentive
great servers
delicious_food
outstanding owner
the_food_and_service was_wonderful
we_had_the vegan sampler for
way too_much_food and_left very happily full
highly_recommended
after_reading all_the good_reviews we_came_here because my_wife was in_the_mood for_indian_food
its not_a_big restaurant and_it_is a_buffet
the mother's day special included a_mango_lassi
yum
and_a dolsa
a rolled up pancake with lentil in_the_middle
the_cold bar had varius kinds_of churney
a_salad
some fruit
and_other sauces
there_were also different kinds_of soup
a tomato_soup that tasted a_bit sour
a lentil based soup
and a_spicy soup
its got a_lot_of_the standard indian_fare
what stood out_to me_was_the goat_curry
the_goat meat_was fall off_the bone tender_and_the curry_had an_excellent flavor
also
the_tandoori_chicken was_nice_and juicy
not dry like a_lot_of other joints
the_paneer sagg
a spinach_and cheese dish
was_also pretty_good
there_were_some vegetarian_dishes but being_the carnivore that_i_am
i_did_not partake
i_got_a taste_of_india without blowing out_my palate on ridiculously spicy_food
that_makes this a_decent restaurant in_my_book
my fianc wanted_to_go to_this_place and i_was_a_little nervous at_first since i_have_not had_not been_to a_good indian_buffet_in_town and_i_had given up trying
i_was_really surprised when_we_got here though
first all_of_the_food looked really_fresh
not_like it_had_been made earlier this week and_was reheated
everything_was very_tasty_and not_spicy
i_really_enjoyed their mint_chutney
spinach
pakora
tiki_masala
goat
and_garlic_naan
yes i_did eat all_of that for_lunch
i_know i'm_a fatty
only giving_it star_for no samosas and_the_service was_kind_of lacking
good_food both in_quality and_taste
the_staff_is_friendly a_well
there used_to_be_a couple_of wonderful nepalese restaurants_in_the detroit metro area
and_i've missed them sorely since_they closed
mint's nepalese offerings made this a_must stop place during business pleasure trips_to vegas
and_i've_been here_several_times
this latest visit in may of found mint as more fusion oriented than i_remembered it
they appear to_have dropped some_of_the nepalese dishes
which made_me sad
however
we_found a_great_deal at_mint to be_happy about
lassi bar
both my husband's mint lassi
not sweet
and_my blackcurrant lassi
sweet
were sublime
the color
the_flavor
and the_texture were_all just perfect
we did_not_have liquor in either lassi
drinks list is_extensive
with_many beers i_remember fondly from_my visits
including a_wonderful lambic
a_beer named
troubadour obscura
and_a bock that_is probably one_of_the best beers i've ever_tasted
diverse menu mostly indian with_some chinese
tibetan
and_nepalese influenced dishes with_many can't fail choices
i've enjoyed_the
rebel curry
on_a previous visit
but this_time we_had_the momos delicate meat filled dumplings similar_to a potsticker
served_with_a spicy tomato based sauce
i_had_the tamarind rice
a_vegetarian offering that worked well_as an_entree after_the course_of momos
my_husband_had_the chicken chau_chau one_of_the tibetan noodle dishes_and a_bowl_of the_delicious noodle soup
i_had_the warm sweet carrot_halwa for_dessert and my_husband_had kulfi
our two fellow guests
both newcomers to tibetan and nepalese_food
both enjoyed_the chau_chau with shrimp and_the_lamb momos
service_was spotty the_server had_to_be asked three_times to provide lemon wedges for our_water
and frequently missed at_least_one person at_our four person table when providing refills or removing dishes
and during almost every course beer
entree
dessert we encountered the news that something we'd ordered wasn't available at_that moment
no ras malai or hakka noodles
so each_of were_eating and drinking our
second best
picks for at_least_one course out_of_the menu
the_dessert i_ordered wasn't available and_the_server took it upon himself to_bring me_out mango kulfi instead
which_was_a nice gesture but a_terrible idea
as i_am allergic to mangoes and_had previously indicated i_did_not want mangoes in_my iassi
dishes_are presented attractively on four cornered white plates but presentation isn't really exceptional
in spite of_these hiccups
we_had_a very_good time
which goes to show how excellent the_food_and drink here_are
next_time i'm_in_vegas
i'll be heading to flamingo rd for_another lassi_and a_plate_of momos
cool half moon booths
great_service_and attentiveness of staff
food_was solid all_around
extensive_menu
including jain
gluten_free
vegan
vegetarian_options
i had_the_lamb_vindaloo which_i give_a out_of_town
naan_was_good
the_owner_was very interested in feedback and_once he found_out how_much i_love vindaloo asked_me to_come_back_and try_it after he_made some subtle changes to_improve it
orders_were taken on ipads
i_will_be_coming back
had a_great_experience overall
tandoori_chicken_was way_too dry
definitely_not cooked the_same day
the easiest curry ctm was very_disappointing
i_am_not coming again
the advent and subsequent proliferation of_the indian_buffet has_been a boon to america
even back in_my homeland of kansas i_was only blocks away from_one
mint_indian_bistro fills the gap that my_recent relocation created
their masalas and curries_are great_and genuinely spicy
they_also have just_as many_vegetarian options_as they_do options_for carnivores
which_is_a plus
it_also helps that these vegetarian_options are tasty
avoid any of_their sauced dishes described as
bone in
or
with bone
bone shards can be_found throughout these_dishes
and_while tasty
a bone can_be_a real turn off texture wise if_you_don't break a tooth on_it
that_said
this_is_a minor downside
notes
baskets of_naan like baskets of chips at_a mexican restaurant
oh hell yes
also
paneer varies from restaurant_to restaurant
the_paneer at mint_indian_bistro is_like_a firm tofu
which is_my_favorite style_of paneer
those_of you preferring a creamier paneer are officially on notice
for you'd have_a hard time finding a_better buffet_to embarrass yourself at in_vegas
we_stopped_in for_their_lunch_buffet while_visiting my_sister who lives in_vegas
great_food
great ambience
friendly
efficient staff
will_definitely go_back next_time we're in_town
love_this_place
our new_favorite great food_and_service
good_selection_of good items_on their_lunch_buffet
servers_were attentive but_not overwhelming
we_had a_large_group of about
we called several days ahead to_let them know we_were coming
they_did a great_job even_when we_requested split checks which_they graciously accommodated
a_good mix_of mild_and spicy items to_choose_from on_the_lunch_buffet
and_all is labeled including some suggestions for accompaniments
i_will recommend_this to coworkers who may want to_try_something different for_lunch
great_indian and_nepalese menu great_atmosphere
first class service_and dishes not found in_many reaturants
las_vegas offers great restaurants
i_would_say this_is definately worth_a_visit
a_long overdue update about mint short and_sweet
but_well deserved
mint have clearly listened to_the feedback from yelp over the_last couple_of years
what we_have now is_a well rounded
extremely consistent buffet and_a comprehensive menu ready to_cater_to every food preference
at
for_buffet it's no wonder that_this_place can_have a queue out the_door around lunchtimes
plenty of_delicious fare to_choose_from_and some vegetarian_options for my_wife
oh
and_garlic_naan that's among_the finest in_the_valley
don't miss out
yummy indian_food_and very_good service
i_work for_an_indian company and_have traveled to_india in_the_past and_enjoy the_cuisine
mint has_a daily buffet_that runs
and_is well_stocked
you_can also go ala_carte if_you_like
the_service_is_good and_they_are fast
tables move quickly_and its_a good_place_for families with kids as_well
overall a_good_place
went_on_a recommendation of a_friend in_our dining party
who_had heard_of mint via word_of mouth but_also had_never been himself either
located_in an unassuming strip_mall
mint_is somewhat of_a buried treasure in_vegas
we_went_for_dinner and were_seated in_a spacious booth
the_restaurant_itself was_almost packed at
pm
the_menu itself is_extensive
but_also descriptive and keyed for vegetarian_vegan items
gluten_free
spicy
etc
very impressive regional beer_selection
i_had_never tried indian_beers before
our_party of three enjoyed the_garlic_naan
vegatable samosas
and_the crispy flatbread that was_brought to_the_table was toasted perfectly
for_our mains
we_enjoyed chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_biryani
rogan_josh
with_lamb
and_i_loved loved loved_the buttered masala_dosa i_ordered
i_had_been craving a proper dosa for months
various chutneys_were brought to_the_table as_well
all_of_the items_were delivered with_good timing
and were_all equally delicious_with tender chicken_and_lamb
at_the_time of your_order you_can designate how_spicy you'd prefer your meat curry_dishes
on_a_scale of
our_server_was hilariously talking us into spicier levels and_we_were glad_we agreed with_his recommendations in_the_end
we_ended with_the small dessert offerings of_which i_can't_remember the_name but all_were lovely_and petite
served_in tall shotglasses it_seemed
total bill for_three adults with_one alcoholic drink_and one soda with tax
mint is_definitely_a jewel hidden_in the_vegas rough
we_will_be_back indefinitely
if_not on_this trip
then the_next
both the_lunch_buffet_and the menu_items are_amazing
everything here is_awesome
i'm a_vegetarian
so_i appreciate that_everything on_the_buffet_line and_in the_menu_is labeled with whether it's vegetarian
vegan
gluten_free
etc
etc
to_accommodate all kinds_of diets
you won't regret eating_here
oh yelp
you steered me_wrong on_this_one
i_feel pretty bad about_it actually
because there_are_some things_that mint really does right
unfortunately
few_of these_were related to the_food_itself
the_good they_bring you_a carafe of_water and leave it on_the_table so_you_can refill your_own glass
this is_really_nice when eating spicy indian_food
of_which there_was none here
the_restaurant_is very_clean_and attractive
the_service_is_very friendly
they_bring naan fresh to_your_table and the_naan_was_good
the_bad most_of_the buffet was_bland
bland
bland
and_i_don't mean just 'not spicy' bland
but 'no flavor' bland
the_tikka_masala_was gloppy
like_the cream in it_had curdled
but it_had little flavor
i_was sooo excited to_see goat_curry
my_favorite_dish ever
on_the_buffet
but_it_was bland
bland
bland
the_meat_was good_but_the curry
nonexistant
the_saag was downright horrible the_worst i've ever_had
everything_tasted like they'd forgotten salt
and i_don't_like overly salted food
the_creamy tofu curry_had no_flavor
the_kheer was also_pretty dreadful
they_use rice angel hair instead_of rice
so it_had_a slimy wormy consistency and_the runny 'sauce' did_not taste good
i_usually love kheer but_i took one bite and_that's it
the indifferent the_gulab_jamun was_about average though_i couldn't taste any cardamom in_the simple syrup
which_is_a letdown
the_dal was subtly flavored but_not_too bad
the_best dishes on_the_buffet were_the 'chili chicken'
tasted like mexican indian fusion but actually had_some flavor
and_the 'veggie chow chow' which_is some_sort_of noodle dish_that didn't_really remind me of_any indian_food
but didn't_taste bad
the_buffet_was about per_person
there_were_a surprising number_of indo pak folks in_here
surprising because_of how bad the_food_was
normally at_the places_i frequent in_other cities that have_a_lot_of indo pak clientele
the_food_is_very spicy and_flavorful
sometimes too_spicy_for my pansy white arse even
but here
it_was_like the baby food bland version_of everything
why were they here
is this_really the_best_indian_food available in_vegas
i shudder to_think that_is_the case
i_hope_they were_just having a_bad day but honestly the_food_wasn't good_enough for_me_to want to_find_out
despite_the nice touches of_fresh naan_and abundant water
feel
you_enter this_place and_want_to feel good about_this_place
good lighting comfortable seatings et all
good music
menu card
i_love elaborate menus
ones which tell you details and makes_you imagine and times salivate
this_one takes it_a step ahead it even details items like gluten_free
jain
halal etc
on for menu
service initial
the_manager asks for scale_of spiciness
the_waiter clearly asks for_water with ice or without_it
how_many indian_place do_so
and the_good part ends there
rather miserably
my_friends
veg asked_for_a thali for
question
how_can a_thali for have_only nan
lamb lollypops
not well marinated and rubbery
we_were asked to_rate the_level_of spice_in food
we_asked_for and got_a
for_food
there_is_an apt hindi saying
unchi dukaan feeka pakwan
only pomp and show but_no content
a_good reataurant has_to_be flexible
we_asked_for a_thali which_had kheer for_dessert but we_requested to substitute with gajar halwa
available on a_different thali
the request was rudely turned down not by_the steward but by the_kitchen
we never_got what we_asked_for
the_waiter goofed up plain_rice and jeera rice_and tells us not to_worry he_will have_the ticket updated
i_love food_and feel bad when_my love for food_is weighed in currency
service
this_is_a_great little indian_restaurant or_maybe i've lost how to_rate indian_restaurants since the_indian_restaurants_in austin just plain suck
at least most of_them
the_lunch_buffet had a_decent variety of_vegetarian_and non vegetarian_dishes
along_with a salad_bar and_two desserts
it_was gulab_jamun and something else
i_don't_like desserts so_i_can't comment on_them
the_vegetarian_dishes
kadhai paneer
saag
mushroom potatoes
dal
sambar
idli
rasam
pulao were_all great
in_the non_veg section there_was chicken_tikka_masala
chilli_chicken
tandoori_chicken
goat_curry_and another chicken_dish
they_all were_great
i_ate a_bit_of each coz it_was_that good
also they_bring your_choice of_bread fresh at your_table unlike other_indian_restaurants who leave theirs at_the_buffet table
oh_yeah
if you're indian and_drink iced cold water
you_need_to tell them that
the default water for_us folks is_warm water
great_food
not_too spicey
and i_am_not referring to_indian spice_level
but_very very_tasty
kabob's are_great
soft
and_very_tasty
this_is_one_of_the_best food_i_have experienced in_the usa
and_the_quality can_be compared with_one of_the_best in_india
their beer collection is_also_very impressive
i_haven't found_that level_of collection in any_indian_restaurant
in_fact in_any restaurant
the_only_reason i_am_not giving a five_star is_because their_service
we_were kept waiting_for beer_and food_and additional order_at a_time when there_were not_that many_people in_the_restaurant
this_place_is off_the_strip
it's_in_a little strip_mall type and when_you get_there
you wonder what_you will_find
you_walk_in
and_you still are not_sure
but_once_you sit down
the_servers_are just_as friendly as can_be
they_are are ready_to help you_choose and tell you_what you_are eating
try one_of_the samplers with_a_friend
well_worth_it
when_it started to_come
there's a_few courses
the_server let us_know what_it_was
the_taste_of all_the foods we_ate were wonderful
the_servers_were great
the_location was_good
the_only down fall is_that sometimes they_took a_while_to get_back to_you once_you had your_food
the shittiest indian_food_you can_get anywhere
being from_india
i_know_what the_food_is supposed_to taste_like
the_food never tastes fresh_and mostly smells bad
the_desserts being_the major disappointment
the_service_is real poor and during buffets
u have_to_wait for ages for_just the_bread
the_food overall seems_to be cooked_in_a jiffy using cheap spices_and paying minimum attention_to taste
hygiene has_been my major concern lately
as_the_food gave_me_a bad stomach
the_website does not allow a negative rating
or i_would_have gone for_that
a_pleasant surprise in_a town with a_ton_of mediocre overpriced restaurants
lunch_buffet
including weekends
vegetarian_options galore
delicious_food
best garlic_naan i've ever_had
made_fresh to_order and included
constantly refilled carafes of_water
instant hangover re hydration
comfy and_clean atmosphere
my_only complaints were that there_were_no samosas_and that i_couldn't order_off_the regular_menu during buffet hours
while initially disappointed
the_food on_the_buffet_line was_really_great
we_had_a lunch_buffet_for on_a_friday afternoon
hard_to find parking
it's in_a_small area
so walking just_a_couple min in fire bc you parked so_far is_a pain
clean
to_my_surprise
the_restaurant_is pretty elegant
nice plates_and fancy cup glasses
comparing my experiences with indian_restaurants near uc davis
the_food_is_not spicy_at_all
i_was_expecting it_to_be packed_with flavor
but curries_were nothing close
for my_tastes
overall somewhat bland_and dry
garlic_naan_was great
fresh
but comes_with_a caveat
it_takes forever for_you to_get_some
although it_is ayce
don't_expect to_be coming_back_for more and_more
not_much of_a selection to_choose_from so i_would_say at_most plates
after a_while
the_food gets redundant
my_husband_and_i went_there last_week because everyone had raved_about it
there_was no parking and_its in_a_very busy area
we_went for_the_lunch_buffet_and despite_the crowd it_looked_like everything had been_sitting there a_while
the_desserts were_just plain gross
i will_give them credit for_good naan_bread but_it_wasn't
to_die_for
and_it took_forever_to get_it
we_were almost done before it_was brought to_our_table
and to_top_it all off i_got sick an hr after_i ate_there
it_could have_been an_off day for_them but_i_think i'll_try to_find_a different indian_place
this was_our_first_time trying_indian_food and_we_are now huge fans
the_flavors_were delicious
the service_was_attentive
but_not_too pushy
we_ordered_the sampler for_and we_were_able_to try a_bit_of each_of_the popular dishes
we'll definitely be_back_for_more naan
all fire and no_flavor
vindaloo was_pretty hot
but_no complexity
lunch_buffet
dinner
i've done it_all
i_really_like mint_and all_their veggie selections for_us non meat_eaters
the_menu_is easy_to navigate and_is coded with abbreviations to_let you_know which_is vegetarian_friendly
gluten_free
etc
i_usually opt for the_aloo_gobi or the_chana_masala with_a_side_of garlic_naan_and always end_up leaving happy
like_i mentioned earlier
i've stopped_in a_few_times for_the_lunch_buffet_and always leave happy as_well
they_can a_bunch_of great choices for_lunch_and they_always like_to keep_the
veggies
in_mind with a_bunch_of meatless dishes_which are_all labeled
warmed up
and ready_to go
definitely a_favorite of_mine and definitely_a step up from_the himalayan joint they used_to_be
coming back soon and_definitely coming back hungry
my_boyfriend_and_i love_this_place
yum
we_will_be bringing his parents back
they_are indian so_that means a_lot
phenomenal
excellent portion_size and_flavor through_the roof
super courteous staff
menu is_awesome so many_options
vegetarian
vegan

best_indian_food_in_vegas
i've_lived in_vegas_for years
and before that in_the_bay_area
where u can_find the_best_indian_food
but it_took_me years
finally
no_more eating this fake indian_food_in_vegas
i_was_on a quest to_find_the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas which_is easy and_hard at the_same_time
it's_easy_to pick out the_bad ones
and_hard to_find_the exceptional ones
luckily
this_is_the exceptional one
this_place hits all_the positive points there_are to_hit
especially for_lunch
service_is_good
the_place_is_clean and_well maintained
for_lunch
their_buffet_is simply the_best
there_is quality
flavor
variety_and value in what_you_pay
they're also strict on_their health code
at least to the_customers
they_are watching like hawks for_any plate re use
for_dinner
i_know foods aren't the_same_as they way they are_served for_lunch
and i_haven't_tried all of_them
they're supposed_to be_better as they're supposed_to be_prepared fresh for_you
the_ones i_have_tried have_been good and_full_of_flavor and_quality
the_only_thing to note is_the absurd price_of dinner entrees
like_any indian_place really
that's why i_can't give_it stars
i_am utterly addicted to their_lunch_buffet
the_food_is fantastic
and the_servers_are very_polite_and professional
i_love_this_place to death
one_of_the_few places where you_can still get an_authentic multilayered whole_wheat paratha made on_the tawa
indian girdle saucepan
as it_should_be and not_in_the tandoor
indian oven
makes all the_difference in_the taste
they_serve the_usual north_indian food plus south_indian fare also such_as idlis
though biryani_is a standard item on_their_menu the_owner on occasion makes some biryani himself and_i_am keen on trying his biryani
service is_very_good and_friendly
compared_to most buffets
for_lunch
of_its kind i_thought theirs is among_the better ones i've come across
simply awesome_food
manu covers almost_everything
my_friend took_me here for_the_buffet the_parking was tough and it_doesn't look_like much from the_outside
once_we got inside i_was_surprised to_see_how comfortable
clean_and how friendly the_employees were
i_can_see why it's tough to park everyone wants to_eat_here
the_food_was_so fresh_and_delicious
the_price_is right too
they_have_the buffet days a_week at the_same_price
that_is impressive
i_told my_friends
my_one friend took her husband_and two sons
middle school
she said
they_all enjoyed it_very_much
great_find
the_worst food_and_service ever
the_rice_was under cooked and_the milk which_was used for the_mango shake was expired so they_had to_go_back change it
after leaving
of our_group had_a_very bad stomach ache
sounds too_much right
well
after_all that has_been said
god is_my witness
mediocre buffet disappointing experience
after looking_at_the yelp score on this_restaurant we_decided_to visit it_for buffet_and ended_up_with a_major disappointment
if_you_don't want_to experience below
don't visit this_restaurant
inferior food_quality most_of_the_food items had poor preparation and lacked taste
poor selection_of_food items
low hygiene the_place didn't_look clean
the_floor was dirty and_i_could notice food particles lying down the_floor at several places
taste
not so_good
i_can_get better_food elsewhere in below average restaurants
there_are several better places_in_vegas if_you_want to_try_out indian_food
just avoid this_one
oh wow
how do_i describe this_place
i've_always said_that any ethnic restaurant where people_of that ethnicity fill the_place must_be either good_or they pay a_lot_of_people to_sit_in the_window
in_this case
it's_the former
i_went_with an_indian friend_and she_was in heaven
i've been_to_india a_couple_of_times and the_food_here is_as_good_as anything i_had there
prices_are_reasonable
warning
if_you_order the inferno curry
the waiver isn't_a joke
this curry_is made_with pure ghost peppers_and it will_take a_half gallon of lasse to cool the burn
but_it's delicious once the burn subsides
i_loved_it
in one_word
go
great_service
great_food
great_selection
our_dinner party_of four included a_vegetarian
a gluten_free vegetarian
and low carb dieters
mint was made_to_order for_us
you_would never guess that_the buckwheat naan_was gluten_free
the_vegetable_korma was delicately seasoned
creamy
but we_asked_for medium_spice
so_it did_have a_little kick
the marinated vegetables cooked_in_a tandoor were spicy_and smoky too_much_for one_person
i hear the_chicken tandoor dishes_were delish too
we will_return
thanks mint
awesome
first_time ever eating_indian_food because i've always_been afraid
but the_only word that comes_to mind about my_experience is_awesome
the chile chicken_and lentel soup appetizers_were perfect
and the_main_course dip like stuff was_all seasoned perfectly
i_can't_speak for_it myself but_i also hear the_lunch_buffet_is fantastic
i_hate buffets
ever since_i_was about years old and_ate a horrific piece_of cold fried_chicken at_the circus circus buffet
i pretty much avoid them unless they're being paid_for or someone i_know really wants to_go_with them
for_a_while this even extended it_to restaurants i_liked or cuisines i_enjoyed that offered buffets
i_would skip those and_order a_la_carte
with my_recent love for mt everest's lunch_buffet_and my complete obsession over indian_food in_general
i_figured it_was time_to venture out and_try another
i'm ridiculously smart for_this decision
because mint blew me_away at_lunch today
we_were_seated and_offered a_choice_of naan and_i_ordered an iced_tea before going up to_grab a_plate
naturally i skipped over_the fruits and_veggies on_the first cart and_went right to_the rice
pakoras
and varieties_of dals
curries
and chicken_dishes
first_thing i noticed_that i_appreciated wholly was_that each_item had notations on whether they_were vegan
vegetarian
had glucose
or had jain
one_of_the friendly servers heard my_friend_and_i seemingly confused over what that_even was and_she explained it
people who dont cant eat garlic or onions
perish the thought
i annoyed her with_my lactose intolerance issue as_i do everyone that_i encounter in_a_food establishment
but_still took_my chances with just_about anything_that didn't say
paneer
on_it
my goal at indian_buffets now is_to never return_for a nd plate
of_course this just means that i_have_a mountain of_food on_my one and_only plate
and_mint was no_exception
if i_went_back for_seconds they probably_would have closed down_for the_day
pretty_sure i_was triple stacking items and_just letting them_all ooze together
it's_like an fountain drink suicide indian_style
the only_negative i_can think_of on selection this day was_no samosas
seemed_like_a greek joint without falafels
got back to_the_table with_my iced_tea waiting and a_basket_of fresh
hot_naan followed shortly after
every single bite was_delicious
i_wish_i_could go into greater detail on each component
but_it wouldnt be adequate
i_probably had different_items on_my_plate
and_i repeat
every_bite was_delicious
price_was standard and worth_every_penny
one final exemplary service note which might_have just been circumstantial
but on_the receipt it noted that the_naan_was with
no butter
i_think_the woman that_was working at_the_front of the_line may_have informed our_waiter to hold the_butter on the_naan as_she overheard the_two lactose intolerant weirdos in_line discussing it
way to_make us_feel welcomed
gotta go on_this_one
though i'm starting to wonder if there_are any indian_restaurants here in_town i_dont like
amazing_food and excellent_service
off_the_strip so_it's quiet
so
i_went_here with one_of_my friends_and i_was_really_excited for the_place
we_are seated relatively quickly_and it_takes awhile to finally get menus from our_waiter
that_did not_really bother me too_much
but
it_gets better
after_ordering a series of_dishes
it_takes unusually longer than_it should_have
and
when_we_got our_food
there_was hair in the_chicken_tikka_masala_and rice
yes three hairs in each one
i_was shocked and disgusted at_this
we immediately inform the_staff of_this and receive a_half baked apology
but
they replace it with_no problem
we_get the_food back
but_now our naan_is cold
so
we ask for_the_naan to_be warmed or get new naan
they oblige and we_get new naan
my_friend takes a_bite into his potatoes that we_got and_there yet again another hair
but
this_one being smaller
i_have_never_been to place_that allows its cooks to_leave hair in_the_food
it_is_very careless of_them
i_was_expecting amazingly service
but_was met with subpar service
i_expected amazing_food
but_i_was met with hair in_the_food
i_will_not_be back_here
too gross to_eat hair in_the_food
foodies beware
wonderful food_and_service
the buttered garlic_naan is_the_best
my_favorite_dish is_the malai_kofta_and the_lassi menu_has every flavor imaginable
i_tried_the rose lassi and_it_was_delicious
was_here over_a great weekend where we_saw peter gabriel at planet hollywood and_the beatles love show by cirque du soleil
we_could_have eaten anywhere on_the_strip
but chose mint based upon their_menu and reviews
we_came_in late
after love and were_seated
the gentleman who came_over to_our_table was_a joy
asking us what_we might like
the_level_of spice we may want in our_food
etc
he_is the_owner
the menu_is_extensive
northern
southern_indian with himalayan foods offered
as_well
i_asked_for his help in navigating the_menu_and he guided us brilliantly
the_food
service_and experience_was one that_i_will repeat every_time i_am_in_vegas
it_was_that good
very nice_place
good waiters
nice food
lunch_buffet_is each
eat as_much as_you like
meat_is halal
awesome
possibly the_best_indian_food_i_have had_in_vegas so_far
i_had_the rebel curry
which while not_being spicy_at_all was_very_tasty
my_friend_had the_chana_masala
we_also split a_couple_different kinds_of naan
i_thought the_dining_area was_nice
the lights were dim and_the tables_were spread out enough_that it_was_pretty quiet in_there
we_also_tried a_few_different deserts and_they_were very_good
the_menu_was huge so i_will_definitely_be coming to_try_some more_dishes
best_indian in_las_vegas
me_and_my fiancee finally_got a_chance_to come_here
we_ordered one_of_the dinner_for
can't remember_the_name_of it
but_its a sampler
all of_them were awesome
i_cannot_wait to_go_back
as_a person_who grew up_eating curry a_few_times a_week
i_have high expectations when_it_comes_to curries or_any type_of indian_food_for that matter
this is_one_of_my_favorite indian_restaurants_in_las_vegas
your best value_for eating_here is to_eat during_the buffet_lunch hours
you_have the_opportunity to_sample a_variety_of the top_notch dishes and_always go_back_for seconds
or thirds
the_dinner is_good
too
but your bill can add up quickly once you_order an_appetizer
two entrees
and_naan
well i_would_have given it_stars except that the_service_was lousy i_was_there by myself and_felt invisible
they_were_very nice when they_did show up
had_to_ask twice to_get_a beer
it_wasn't that busy come_on now
what really pissed me_off was_the brown_rice scam
i_was_told my_meal came_with white race and i_asked_for brown and_was charged extra
you gotta be f ing kidding me
i_expect to_get reamed on_the_strip but here
all that_said it_is_a really nice_place
very attractive
tasty_food and_best beer_selection i_have every since in_an_indian_restaurant including some indian_beers i_had_never seen before_and the_one_i ordered was_quite_good
if they_can up their game on service_and stop selling brown_rice at gunpoint i would_have_been much happier
dinner_for_two
first one listed on_the_menu
was_absolutely_delicious
will_definitely put this_place_on our regular rotation of restaurants
price_is very fair and atmosphere_is pleasant
great_lunch time buffet
good_service
great_naan
and good_food
junk
i'm_very disappointed_in yelp_reviews on_this_one
the_flavors_were not_that_great
nan_bread did_not come_out until we_were finished with our_lunch
i_will_not_be back
there_is another place here in_lv that blows this_place away
i_am typically not_a_huge_fan of_indian_food
but this_place_has changed my_mind
the_decor_is_very modern and_the_restaurant does not_have that usual smell that comes_with indian_cuisine
the_meal is buffet_style
and_although i_was_not certain what the_items i_was putting on_my_plate were they_all tasted yummy
i_especially loved the_garlic_naan_bread with the_sauces they provided
so_good
i_wish this_place wasn't so_far away
they make_me want_to_be vegetarian
they_do_have chicken_and goat
which_are delicious
but_the vegetarian_food is_like no other
they_serve fresh bread
i_usually_go for the_garlic butter naan
for the_drinks
i_like_the mango_lassi because_it thick_and not_overly sweet
the_decor_is_very special_and feels warm
it's_a very simple restaurant
but i_love_it
the waiters_are quick_to clean up finished plates
i've_only had_the_buffet here
which_is about
very low price_for delicious_food
in_the_buffet
each_item is labelled with_a_lot_of details
so_you_know exactly what_you are eating
lunch_buffet
quit reading this_review and_go get_you some
the_food_was_so good
meats were cooked_well
not_just chewy mystery meat_in sauce
everything_was flavorful
it_was_a_very casual environment
and_it_wasn't touristy
the_food_and_service here are_so_good
everything_is done_with care
and probably love
every_dish reflects the interest in maintaining high_quality
that_is
the_chefs don't seem bored
even_with the_typical standby items you_find on_the_menu of an_indian_restaurant
and speaking of_the_menu
the_names and descriptions of each_dish are as delightful to_read as the_food_itself is_to consume
the mighty momos were_a highlight
but_i_would order_the vertical vindaloo_and mango masala dish again as_well
i_tried to_give_it
hearts
but evidently yelp doesn't accept any special characters
unfortunately
after living here a_year i've discovered that_my beloved new city is sorely lacking_in indian_food
perhaps i_was spoiled by having_the delights of devon so close_by
but_i really came to_take quality indian_restaurants for granted
we've been coming_here since_we_were tourists and this_place_was known simply as
himalayan cuisine
with nepalse plates_and much_more rustic decor
nowadays
the redone and renamed mint_is more of_an indo_chinese fusion sort of_place
but they_have that_one hallmark that_every self respecting indian_restaurant needs a_lunch_buffet
it_has_a good_selection compared_to some_of_the_other indian_lunch_buffets in_town_and is a_really_good deal at
the ala_carte dinner_menu is_very comprehensive and_has lots_of options_and tweaks available to_the courses
but_we pretty much exclusively come for_lunch when the_value is best
the_service_has traditionally been awful and inattentive but has gotten much better lately
with_that marked improvement this is_clearly our top choice_for indian_food_in_the_valley
i_had_a buy one get_one entree coupon to_this_restaurant
so_i_decided_to stop_by because i_really_like indian_food
it_was buffet time there
and_most restaurants don't honor the bogo entree coupons for_buffet
so_i_was thinking it_might not_go as planned
but the_waiter said i_could use_it
great_deal
the_other bonus about_this_place besides how_good the food_tastes
is_that_it offers gluten_free food actually labeled
gluten_free
i_have celiac disease so_that meant a_lot to_me
thanks mint_indian_bistro
i_like you_guys
i've_found over_the years
that trying an_indian_restaurant during their_lunch_buffet is_by_far_the_best value
and a_great_way_to try_new_things without being disappointed if_you_don't really like_it
i_love chicken_tikka_masala
unfortunately mint's didn't_really tickle my fancy as_much_as_i was_hoping it_would
it_was_good
but_not as flavorful as i'm_used_to
that being_said
they_had other_dishes that_were delish
i_liked their chili_chicken
and chicken_vindaloo
their garlic_naan_was fluffy_and yummy
and_both rice dishes_were good
give_this_place_a try
fantastic_food
great_service
friends love_their mango_lassi
which_is_a yogurt drink
tried_this_place for_the_first_time tonight
loved_the_food and_the_service_was_great
can't_wait to_come_back_and try_different stuff
my_husband_and_i went here_on_a wednesday evening around p
m
the_restaurant_was fairly busy with_both dine_in customers_and a_to_go line
they_also seemed understaffed
and worst of_all
the_waiters use ipads to_take your_order
which seemed_to be more_of_a burden for_them than_a time saver
our_waiter seemed_like he cared but_was overwhelmed
some_other members of_the_staff
however
seemed the_opposite
part_of_the reason we_tried this_indian_restaurant was_because it_has a_full_bar
unfortunately
simple mixed drinks took between minutes to_arrive at our_table
i would_not_recommend ordering any_of_the more elaborate drinks on_the_menu because_the wait_time would probably_be even longer
we ordered_naan
an_appetizer
and_two entrees
they_brought_out the_naan first
then minutes later
only_one entree
then we_waited about ten_minutes for the_second entree
thankfully
we_were sharing both things
or this would've been way awkward
at_this_point
we_still hadn't received our_appetizer
so_we asked_the_waiter to please cancel it
the_food_was actually quite great
we_ordered_the chef's special lamb kabob and_the vertical vindaloo with_chicken thigh
and_they_were both excellent
the_vindaloo_was not saucy enough for_my_liking
and_the
full
size was_rather small_for_the_price
other_than_that
we_weren't disappointed_by_the actual food
despite its strange delivery times
we_are easy on salt
the_worst thing ever heardfrom a_restaurant manager when complained that_the_food had_no salt in_it
i_know it's a_star rated restaurant but_its been_more favored for family friends than new customers
don't ever go_during rush hours
they_say they_have indo_chinese fusion food
don't order any chinese dish as_it has_no salt in_it and_the_restaurant manner instead_of apologizing say that_they_are easy on salt
i_will_never ever go_back to_this_restaurant
this_is_my personal experience
must go
while in_vegas
being from the_bay_area
i_have indian_pakistani restaurants by_the dozens everywhere
so
when_we looked up_for indian_food_in_the vegas_area
i_wasn't having high expectations
i_was_surprised by what_i had there
it_was freaking amazing
and_the cherry on_the cake
it_was zabihah halal
we_had_the following
chicken fried_rice
absolutely awesome
the_rice had a_slight crunchy texture_and though by concept may sound like raw
but was_actually superb
yellow dal
the_best dal i_have_had in_the_us
period
low in spices and_full_of_flavor
in_love_with dal now
malai_kofta
didn't care much for_the kofta
but_the gravy was_awesome
chicken kadhai
wasn't_bad but_we_had far superior food on_our_table
chicken momos
the momos were_amazing but_the sauce_with it_wasn't
i_have_had a_lot_of momos in_india
my_fav roadfood snack after chaat
i_used_to love the_chilli sauce served_with the momos in_india
here_the momos were_pretty close_to_the original though
paneer pakoda
good
liked_the sprinkling of chaat powder over_it
chilli_chicken
was_nice
not_like india
but am_not complaining
the_portion_sizes could_be upped a notch
the_half portions_are way_too small_and the_full aren't that large themselves
the decor_is_nice
not date_night but better_than indian_restaurant standards
the_service_was really_good
except their biryani nothing is_really worth_trying
i_had planned on visiting this_restaurant during_our visit_to lv christmas
took_the bus off_the_strip to_the atomic research museum across_the_street from_the mint_indian_bistro
after_the museum
we walked across to_the_restaurant and joined the_line for_the sunday lunch_buffet
we added our name to the_list
which_was on_a tablet
ipad perhaps
with_the help of another customer
this_was_a new experience for_me
the_restaurant_is only so big and_we must of hit a popular time
polite host and waiters
waiter_was great
especially for_a_buffet
we were_a_bit out_of place
as we_are not_indian
but_i saw_that as a_good_sign as we_waited
it must_be really good_indian_food
it_was_great
my_wife thought_it_was too_hot
but_she likes very_mild
the_flavors_were wonderful
i've_been_to indian_buffets before
but_this_was more extensive
this will_be_a repeat should we return_to lv
good tasty_food
spices_are added appropriately for_the dishes
must eat place_if visiting_vegas
went_here_for dinner yesterday
the_place_was_packed for_a monday night but_they arranged a_table for_us after a_minute wait
the_server quickly brought out_some papads and_chutneys coriander and_tamarind
the_chutneys tasted_great
i_remember visiting a_long_time ago for_the_buffet and not_being very_excited about_the_food
this trip was different
we all_were excited to_see so many_options of different_types_of indian_food
and_tried the_following
chau_chau noodles with veggies this_was yummy despite the_taste_of tomato ketchup in_it
really yummy actually
schezwan fried_rice good
dal_makhani yumm
saag with paneer flavorful
cheese_naan
naan_and tandoori roti were_fresh and crisp
the_only_downside was the_fact_that the_portion_sizes are_quite small_for_the_price
they_also charge for chutney
onions etc
i_look_forward_to going back_and trying some_other stuff like south_indian_food and_indian street_food
which_i always seem_to crave
the_difference between their gulab_jamun and heroin is_that one is_a hopelessly addictive substance
known for_its ability_to wreck one's health and soul
as_one lies
cheats
steals
and_even kills just_to lay hands on a_little_more
to_get that blissful feeling
and_the_other is_an illicit narcotic
everything else on_the_lunch_buffet was_pretty_good
too
but
when_i'm lbs and diabetic
it'll be mint's gulab_jamun to blame
this little_gem is nestled not far off_the_strip and boasts one_of vegas' most extensive indian_style menus
there must_be over
different combinations of_how you_could experience their_food so_that's one_of_the main reasons i keep_coming back
well
that
and_the beer_selection
you'd be_hard pressed to_find_a more eclectic selection anywhere else
norse
belgian
indian_and much_more adorn the beer_list
but prepare to_be occasionally disappointed since they_will run out_of their more esotheric brews
but_i digress
getting back_to_the food
huge portions
with_the option_of half portions
score
multiple vegetarian vegan_options
had_the kofta tonight
and_delicious naan roti make_this a_must stop for_me whenever i'm_in_vegas
try the_tikka
biryani or_any of_the_curries and you_won't_be sorry
simple review for_this_place
lunch_buffet_that is_awesome
great_quality food_with a_decent variety
they_also offer off if you show your unlv student id
lack_of th star_because if_you_order any drink that is_not water it_takes them a_long_time to bring_it
but_the decor_is_nice and the_staff_is_friendly_and the_food_is_good
great_place to_get_your indian fix in
oh_and if_your into the_whole vegan thing they have_a_lot_of options_for that on_their_menu
simply amazing
no words to_describe how incredible the_food_is
tikka_masala is_to_die_for
the_service_was_great
too
they_were_all very_friendly_and overall it_was_a_great experience
believe the_reviews hype
in_the words of nike
just do_it
i'm definitely doing it_again that's for_sure
fresh
delicious
indian_food for_the_lunch_buffet
worth_the_wait
as you're seated they_bring you fresh made naan of your_choice
buffet_line has vegetarian_entrees along_with chicken_and goat
mmmm mmmm good
yummy indian_food
our_first_time here
we_came for_the_lunch_buffet
which_was a_great_deal at_around
there_was a_lot_of variety here
almost too_much
as_it_was hard_to tell the differences by_a non seasoned indian_food expert like_me but_everything was_fresh_and good
except the_tandoori being a_little overcooked
here_is a pic of my_plate
http
www
yelp
com_biz_photos mint_indian_bistro las_vegas
userid ezzyujdouig p gyb pv a hnflw fvu avvij a
there_were_some really_good dishes
but i_really_enjoyed_the chicken_and mild curry goodies
also
the_garlic_naan_bread was_super yummy
i_also liked_the more_spicy chicken_dish
which_had peppers_and other tidbits
they_have plenty of orange slices for_my little one
which_makes him a very_happy boy
come check_it for_a_great and inexpensive indian_food buffet
the_lunch_buffet can't_be beat here
the_price_is super cheap_and the_food_is_very_good
is_it worth_the hour long_wait one_time
when the_line was_out the_door and_had_to wait_a super long time for_a_lunch at pm on_a_thursday
ehh
the buzz must_have gotten out cause this place_was_packed for_lunch
the_garlic_naan_is super fresh_and keeps coming out when asked_for
the selections at_the_buffet are_all tasty_and good
my_go_to indian_food_is always chicken_tikka
tandori
rice_and goat_curry which_are all_good here
the_tandori is_not too_dry
which happens often for indian_buffets i_noticed
and the_goat_curry has lots_of actual goat meat
spicy factor is_definitely there_so be_warned
i_also_ordered a_mango_lassi but_that_was ok
i_think it_was_a pre made_from a carton though
boo
which is_a_little disappointing
the_only issue is when_it's packed
the_service gets a_little slower and_the_wait is_pretty long since people do not_want_to leave without getting more_than their money's worth
you_know a_place is_super good when_it's native people_are taking over the_place
not trying_to be racist but_this_place was_full_of indians and_their huge families
so_it must_be good right
don't miss out_on this_place_and lunch is_very_good cheap eats for great_food
i_liked_the simple decor_and that this_place_had an_amazing menu_with entrees from all_over india as_some of_my_favorite dishes_are south_india
sadly they_were_busy and understaffed and caused my_friend_and_i to almost miss our flight
we spent over hours here
when_we first arrived there_was_only one_other party within an_hour the_place_was_packed
lucky restaurant apparently bad_for us
things we dined on
garlic_naan
a_little_too crispy for_dipping in my_entree broth but_still_good
veggie kofta
lacking flavor although_the kofta had the_right texture
plain dosa
massive in size check out_my photos
dosa tasted_great but_the coconut_chutney was_probably_the worst i've tasted
saag_paneer
lacking more_flavor then_the kofta
do they not season the_food_at all
lime soda
suppose to_be fresh squeezed limes
you_could clearly taste that it_was_not
rose lassi
never_tried a rose lassi before although i_love mango and_mint lassi's and_i_love rose ice_cream and_yogurt
not_what i_was_expecting
service_was terrible took minutes_to_get us our_drinks alone then our_order was taken add another mins
no i_am_not kidding
i_remember this like yesterday although_it_was almost weeks_ago
this_was_a very stressful dining_experience for my_friend_and_i
a not_so pleasant way for_us_to spend our_last few hours in_vegas
i will_not_be_returning when back in_vegas
this_is_the_best place_in_vegas
we love_the_food
the_staff
and the_lunch_buffet
we_eat the_lunch_buffet on_a_regular_basis and_love getting to_enjoy a_good meal_and talk with the_staff
we_go all_the_time
curry addicts
great options_for all kind of diets and special needs
vegan
vegetarian
meat lovers
etc
safe to_pass
i_gave it_stars for_their off_the_menu food
its pricey and the_quantity is bit low
their_buffet_is the_best_indian_buffet i've ever_had
there_are_so many varieties_of veg_and non_veg curries
two different_types_of naans
rice
different indo_chinese dishes
food tests excellent and_its only plus tax per_person
there buffet_is from am pm daily
they_get bit busy over the_weekend so_there might be minute wait
this_place_is_good every_time_we go
this_time we_got_there right at as they_were opening the_buffet
all_the_dishes were_out
hot_and delicious
the_staff_is_friendly_and courteous
i make_it a_point to_bring out_of towners here
delicious
authentic_indian_food
i_love to_eat
no surprises there
but_what i_really_love is_a cuisine specific buffet
i'm fond of smorgasbord buffets too
but_there's something_about just indian_food_or just chinese_food or_just mexican_food
and endless amounts of_it
that make my_heart go pitter patter
in_an excitement way and a_high blood pressure and cholesterol way
so_when in_a panic of needing indian_food_and needing it now
i met my girl jaime w for_some ayce yums
when_we_arrived
we_were given menus
wtf for
i_thought
it turns out_that in_addition_to their delicious lunch_buffet
they_have_a hefty selection_of drinks
alcoholic and_non
next_time
i started_off wrong by getting a_small plate instead_of the bigass one necessary for_all indian_food pursuits
it_didn't take me long to_fill it_up
i_did_not care_for the_green salad too peppery but_hey
that's the beauty of_the_buffet
chutneys all_were so winning
especially combined with_any of_the_other various items on_the_buffet
you can't_go_wrong_with mango_chutney and paneer_tikka_masala
amirite
the_menu_is supermenu
so clearly marked for anybody with dietary restrictions
my_only dietary restriction is having only_one stomach so_i'm_not concerned about vegetarian_vegan gluten_free but_if that's your bag
here's your place
i_also_like how there_are menu suggestions and_they let_you know_that some_things are desserts
except those little donuts
those are marked wrong
they_are for every course
definitely_will come_back_for the_dinner_menu and for_the_buffet again
can't complain about_a thing
service
awesome
food
massive
ambiance was_great
my_first_time here_and ill be_back
leftovers were_super good at_the crib
i grinded it_up the_next_day
my first_time_here and_it_was absolutely_amazing
surprisingly superb beer_selection
our_server was_very_helpful
made great_suggestions and_was genuinely kind
great_place
mint is_really_good
i_am_not overly familiar_with_indian cuisine so_i_can't give great insight but_what we_ate was_delicious_and i_had_to be rolled out_on_a cart by my_wife afterword
they_have_a really_delicious buffet
if_you_have any special dietary restrictions
this is_the_place_to_go
they mark each buffet item as vegan vegetarian gluten_free more
i_really appreciate that
mint is_located a_few blocks from_the_strip and practically across from the_university
this attracts both visitors and local students to_their restaurant
the_lunch_buffet_is what i_usually_go here_for
with_the unlv discount
it_is_an affordable and_tasty option
during_the daytime
the_interior looks bright_and airy
at_night it_has_a moody romantic atmosphere
the_servers_are always friendly_and i'm so_glad they_are_very accommodating for_people with food allergies
the_menu_is clearly labeled with icons indicating veg gf nuts etc
onto_the food
goat_curry_and any paneer dish are_the things_i make_a beeline for
the_goat is tender and_full_of_flavor every_time_i come_here
for_dinner
i usually_get takeout on_my way_home
i've tried_the rebel curry
saag
rogan_josh
and_a_few others
there's lots to_try here
dinner or lunch
mint does not_disappoint
finishing the_last episode of gordon ramsey's great escape
i_had_the strongest urge for_some flavor packing curries_and was instructed to_come_here by_my over zealous vegan friend
this_restaurant has such a_wide_variety_of curries of non vegan and_vegan selections
their_buffet runs from am pm_and might i_say
something everyone should become very familiar_with
the_buffet_is only and it_comes_with such a_variety_of foods
it's such a_steal
considering i_came_here for_dinner_and ordered chicken_tikka_masala
buttered chicken
and_naan
the_bill came_out_to about
the_buffet includes chicken vegetable tikka_masala
tandoori_chicken
basmati_rice
bone in lamb_curry and more_dishes i_can't pronounce
it includes normal and_garlic_naan
the_curry is packed_with so much_flavor
the_naan comes_out freshly made
hot
the_meat of_the tandoori_and chicken_tikka_masala_is slightly dry but other_than_that i_really can't complain
food_is an_a for_me
the_only complaint_i have_is for_dinner
their portions_are a_bit small_for what_you_pay for but nonetheless still very_tasty
service_is spot_on and punctual whenever you're out_of drink
naan or if_you_have empty plates
oh_yeah their_naan_is refillable
our_server was_extremely_friendly
wasn't overbearing and_took care_of us throughout the_whole dinner
ambiance_was very_warm
lights dim but_not dungeness and_with trending indian songs to_add culture to a_very modern looking restaurant
despite having a_few indian_restaurants surrounding this_area
i'll always return_to mint_for their money worthy buffet
vegan_options
affable and attentive_service and_their delicious_food
in looking_at the_reviews_on mint
i_had_my expectations set very high when walking_into this small resturant
they_were quite busy when_we_arrived after pm on_a_saturday_night
but the_wait wasn't too_long
though there_wasn't_a place to_sit down inside
it_was_a cold night_in vegas
you'll see_that i frequent indian_restaurants fairly regularly wherever i travel
so_i know_what_i like and how_it compares to_other establishments
my_family and_i_decided_to go_with_the chef's northern india tasting menu and_were given_a plethora of different_dishes
though with smaller than normal portions
we_all enjoyed the_pakora
they called them pakodas
and_again thought we_were_in for_the_best indian_meal in_a_long_time
that being_said
the_lamb_vindaloo was_rather skimpy on the_lamb
and_it_was tougher than it_should have_been
the_chicken_tikka_masala had great_flavor
but was_more masala than chicken
and the_daal was_good
but_just a_tad undercooked
i_was also disappointed when_i asked_for_a
spicy
i_received something more_like_a or
they_do_have something they call inferno chili_sauce
but_i_thought my dishes came from a_very universal pot that's geared to less spice
and_flavor
as_other reviewers have noted
their naan_bread_is excellent
service_was satisfactory
but_i never felt_like_i was_being
served
meaning it_was_more obligatory than driven
all in_all
a_good_indian meal
though i_have_had better for_less money
this was_my_first indian_restaurant_in_vegas
went_with a_friend_and it_was_great
i'm looking_forward_to going back_and maybe try_the inferno menu
i'll sign the waiver
everything_we_had was darn_good
i_can not remember the_actual name of_the_dish i_had but it_had mango and_chicken but_it_was super
my_friend_had a_veggie dish based off_of a butter_chicken curry
and_he_said his too was_good
i've been telling my_friends all_about it
mint is_my_favorite_indian_restaurant in_the_valley
i_love coming_here not_only because_it's near unlv
but because_it's really_good
you_can't beat
tax for_a delicious lunch_buffet_with off if_you're_a unlv student
it_just doesn't happen
their butter naan_is so_yummy
i_have_to remember not to_fill_up on_that so_i_can fit more delicious_food in me
my ocdness likes that_they organize their_buffet trays from starters to sides to entrees
they_used_to have_a dessert warmer at_the very end
but i_think_they nixed this because not_enough people_were utilizing it during_the_lunch hours
my favorites_are
and i_will_definitely butcher the correct names_of these items
the yellow indian fried_rice with vegetables
fried vegetables
the noodles with vegetables
chicken_tikka_masala
i_know that_one
goat_curry
and_spicy chili_chicken
i'm pretty_sure i've tried everything there
but these_are my_go_to dishes
the stars comes from food_and price alone
they_really do_have delicious high_quality food
the_service_is consistently mediocre if_not subpar
but if_i'm at_mint it's for_the_food
also
it_takes awhile for drinks to_come_out
especially if_you_order coffee
i_don't_know_if it's_a cultural thing
but_i've almost always received my coffee at_the_end_of my_meal
i_would prefer it as_an accompaniment to my_meal
and getting your bill can take awhile too sometimes
if i_have_to leave
i_just go up_to_the counter and pay
and fair warning
you_will leave the_restaurant full and_with_a lingering fragrance on_your clothing and hair for_the_rest_of the_day
you_were warned
one_star
and_there's good reason for_it
visited mint today
i_love_indian_food
i grew up_on middle eastern
pakistani
and indian_food
the_food_here_is not_indian
it's indian made_for american taste_buds
yaddaddaimean
but let's get down_to the critique
service
there hasn't been a_single time that_i_have come_here
in_which i_have felt comfortable walking through the_door
it's_always a depressed emotionally challenged man who takes us to_our seat
water
at_first
is_there quickly
refills are scarce to none
we wait minutes_for the_check every_time
never half a_smile cracked by the_server
s
and_everyone who works here looks
plain
miserable
food
i'm_a_huge curry fan
and a_huge goat fan
both_of these_are garbage
here
and_this_is why
all curry tastes the_same
jus different levels of spicyness
the_goat is terribly undercooked
chewy
and_has no_flavor
as everything else
here
is flavor less
today was the_last straw
there_was hair in_my food
done
i_don't pay money for hair
after the_fact
ive been feeling_like crap all_day
stomach is_not right
i_am unbelievably
and strangely fatigued
i regret this
there's nothing here for_me
i_don't trust this place's discipline in cleanliness at_all
i_don't trust that_it
matters
to_them until they_get caught and shut down
which_they already have
as far_as i've heard
for sanitation
they're here_for_the quick buck
it_seems that there's no
moral standard
in_this business
we_were visiting las_vegas_and were craving_indian_food
mint had_a_lot_of good_reviews and_we decided_to_check this_place_out
the_crowd was_extremely young and_the_place_was lively
the_decor_was okay with muted sounds of_indian cinema music in_the_background
the_menu_was very innovative almost every appetizer_and entree had_a twist
we_are vegetarian_and so this_review won't help if_you_are looking_to hear about the_chicken_tikka_masala
which i_am told is_good
so
we_ordered_the organic samosa_and vegetable_pakoras
we also_ordered_the mahakali mango masala
yes that_is_the real name
dal maharani balti
and_the hariyali kabab
after_a_long day_of gallivanting
we_were hungry_and would_have eaten anything cooked
for_the_food then
while the_names were innovative
the_food not_so_much
the hariyali kabab was green
as expected
but was_bland
the chutneys_were basted on a_bit_too much and_there_was literally no_spice
the mahakali mango masala_was similarly taste free and bland
we_had_ordered this with paneer and_it_was undercooked
the_dal wasn't_bad and probably the_only item that was_tasty enough
the breads
on_the_other_hand
were_fresh and_nice
also there were_a_lot_of innovative lassi types
these were_very_nice as_well
perhaps the_items with meat were better and the_crowd was generally having a_lot_of fun
so
we might_have been_the unlucky group
this_place_is definitely worth_a_visit just to_see_the creativity in_the_menu
clean restaurant
i_ate the maharajah tikka_marsala with paneer cheese
really creamy_and very_delicious
i_wanted it_to_be spicy so_i asked_for_a
but_it_wasn't spicy_at_all
my_friend_ordered the_vindaloo with spicy level at and_it_was quite_spicy
not_really consistent with_their spice_levels
im guessing if_you_are ordering something creamy_and you_want_it spicy
at least go with_an
naan_was soft_and good
i enjoyed_it overall
i_had_the privilege of enjoying the_lunch_buffet
fittingly dubbed
nirvana
buffet by the_staff
i_tried almost_everything offered with_the_buffet and_loved each_item
i_will_be_back
medium_spicy turned_out_to be the_most bland indian_food ever at least for_an_indian palate
surprising good for_an inexpensive lunch_buffet
was
before taxes and tips
food choice was limited but_tasty
they_cook your bread to_order
included
and_my buttered naan_was appropriately fresh
hot
a soft_and tasty
soup
salads
entrees_and dessert were_all quite_good and_it's no surprise i_guess that a_good part_of_the crowds were indians
i_ordered_a masala_chai
supplement
that was_also_very nice
this_review_is_for_the buffet_only
unbelievable
everything_is high_quality and consistently amazing
stylish d_cor
fantastic friendly_service
all_the entrees_are labeled so vegans and vegetarians know what's up
i'm addicted to_this_place best indian_buffet_in_town
i_wish_they would open up one on the_west_side
it_would_be packed
when_i first moved_to vegas_i was skeptical about finding as_good of_a himalayan indian_restaurant as_i_had back_home
then i_found_the mint_indian_bistro
it_was_delicious
the_food_is hearty and_flavorful while the_wait_staff_is kind_and giving
the_atmosphere_was cozy
i_felt_like i_could_eat
curl up_and go_to sleep
i_will keep coming_back_to this_restaurant
don't change
a new_favorite
mint delivered with_a_great beer_list
extensive_menu and delicious_food
this_is another almost hidden_gem and feels worlds away_from_the overpriced hotel restaurants
our_group of_four loved the_samosa
saag_paneer
butter_chicken_and shrimp_curry
the_menu_is very diverse and next_time_i_will be_more adventurous
the buttered garlic_naan_was awesome
i_took_my father here_for_a buffet_lunch
it_was his first_time ever eating_indian
the_atmosphere_is quiet and_clean
to_be_honest
i_felt_like this_buffet equally represented cuisines from all_over_the continent of_india
i preferred the_vegetarian_dishes and rather enjoyed them and_my father took a_special liking to_their goat_curry
their goat is very_tender and_has_a light gamy flavor but_was seasoned well
the_vegetable_korma and pav bhaji were_excellent
i_would_highly_recommend this_place_if_you wan't great_indian at prices half_of what you_would expect_to_pay at tamba on_the_strip
we_went_for a sit down dinner
and_i_was completely satisfied_with my_experience
ordered the_malai_kofta and_the_chicken_tikka_masala which both tasted very_good
the_naan was_also_very_good
maybe a_little fluffier in shape as opposed_to flat like i_am_used_to
but delicious
this_is_the_best_indian_food i_have_had_in town so_far
also
the interior_of the_place_is beatiful
lit romantically and well_decorated
i_will_go_back for_the_lunch_buffet next_time
the_service_was_good and we_did_not have_to_wait long to_get_our food
dinner portions might be small to some_people
i_thought_it_was plenty of_food though
met up with_a_friend for_lunch
its been a_while since ive been_here but the_buffet_is still really_good
or
i_dont remember
they_had mint_chutney
very good_stuff
not_spicy though
they_had an_interesting basmati_rice with cashews
dried cranberries
and_other stuff
it_was_pretty_good
never_had anything like_that before
all_of their_curries were_excellent
i_really_liked_the mutton on bone the_most
the_tandoori_chicken was_a_little dry
but_it usually is
lunch had_just started so everything_was fresh
last_time_i ate_here i dunno if_i ate too_much but_i_had really_bad food_coma
this time_i_had plates but feel good
maybe its the_waiters thick indian accent that_makes the_food taste better at_mint
but this_place_is definitely_one_of_the better_places to_get inidian food_in_town

my_husband i were_craving indian_food_and we_decided_to_try out this_spot
we_ate at_the ayce for_lunch_and it_was_ok
the food_tasted like it_had_been sitting_out for_a_while
but_we_were there_at
pm
i_felt_like most other_indian_places have more_of_a variety for_their ayce than this_one
like_i said
the food_was_ok
but_there_are other restaurants_in_vegas that_are much better
my_recent discovery and my_recent all_time favorite_indian lunch_buffet_for only
this_place_is_a bit small
you_have_to come early or wait in_line
during summer months they_have patio dining that relieves over crowding
the_value and_the_quality_of food_is_excellent
you even_get a_choice_of naan
there_are_a varieties_of vegetarian_dishes
and a_handful_of meat_dishes including lamb or goat and_of_course the_usual chicken_curries and_chicken tandorii
dessert is_also included
mint_is my_go_to place_for_indian_food in_town
the_food_is_great and the_menu_is massive
and_it notes healthy
vegetarian
and_vegan_options as_well
they_also_have_a long menu_for drinks
both alcoholic and_not
the_restaurant can_get fairly busy
so calling ahead for a_reservation or_a wait_time is_a_good idea
try_the pistachio kulfi
or four
for_dessert
lots_of organic
gluten_free
and_or vegan_options with food and_drink
very_good service
nice_atmosphere and decent location_and prices
went for_a_late lunch
definitely reccommended
but_don't do what my_friend did and_eat stuff off_of their inferno challenges where you_eat ghost pepper and habeneros infused food in_order to_get on_their wall of fame
it ruined his whole night
food_was_great and_love how easy the_menu_is for_vegetarian vegans amazing
love_the gluten_free designations on_the_lunch_buffet
pleasant
friendly_and competent service
too
highly_recommended as_a close_to unlv and dri lunch location
and_it appears widely approved of by the_indian community in_town
too
but be_warned
it's tiny
and_most tables are booths
so if_you're_a top
you're taking up too_many seats
if you're
you're still a_table hog
best for groups of_and
beware
bread they_offer is_not free
we_got tricked into that so dont make the_same mistake
service
stars
food
stars
best_indian_food we've_had
aahran curry was_amazing
get_it with_lamb
its so_tender
anyways i_would_have given the_place a_star other_than the_fact_that the_guy tricked us into paying_for the_bread we didn't_eat
made_it sound like it_came_with the_meal
we_came_here for_lunch last saturday and_as the_place_was_packed we_had_to_wait for minutes_to_get seated
the_host tried_to push us into sitting outside but most in our_group refused and preferred to wait_for_a_table to_come up
food wise there_were standard items_that you_will find_in any_other buffet
the_taste_was very average with surprisingly no dish really standing out
the_only worthwhile comment was_that_the noodles were_really indian_style chow mein that is_very common in_and around delhi
they_gave us hot bread
naan
at_the_table without charging more_for it
i'm_not sure_if that_is their policy or they_just forgot_to do_that
the_sweet dish
gulab_jamun
looked pretty_nice but_when eaten felt like they_were recycled after_being left around_for a_couple_of_weeks so_you_can avoid that
the_menu on their_website mentions lots_of options_for the_sweet dish but the_only_other item_was an_empty bowl_of mango_custard
service overall was a_little_slow considering the_amount_of rush that_was there
and the_host
could_be the_owner not_sure
at the_door tried to_be friendly_but ended up being very pushy
overall left satisfied but not_overly enthused to_return again
definitely over_priced for the_quality_of_the_food
people almost only ordered a_couple_of appetizers_and curry_dishes
strip_mall ambience_and scarce service during_lunch but_the_food_was a_huge step up from_my low buffet expectations
solid spread of_indian favorites with high quality_ingredients
as_a chicken snob who eschews chicken lips
ankles
and_other ambiguous poultry parts
i_was delighted to_enjoy tasty chicken_breast in their_dishes
the_chicken_tandoori
traditionally had_a mix
contrary to_an earlier post
our naan_was noted on the_bill but_we not charged
we_left both full_and satisfied
recommended
by_far_the_best_indian buffett in us
hoping to_find something similar in boston
like_a topless dancer joggling three flaming chainsaws while doing your taxes
this_place_is awesome
although_it is_located in_a_strip_mall
don't_let_the meek locale deter you from_this trying_out this delicious_indian gem
i_went_here with_my fiancee for_lunch as_we both_were craving_indian and heard it_had_a buffet going_on
her being_a picky eater and me on_a see food diet
i_see food
i eat_it
i_thought a_buffet would satisfy both our needs
although_the choice on_the_buffet might_not be as extensive as_some casino lines
what they_had to_offer were_all amazing
a case of_quality over quantity
you can't_go_wrong_with any dishes
i_have_tried curries from_the east coast and west coast and_even in_india
this_place can easily compete with_some of_the_best curries i've_had
try the_paneer curry
so_good
it_is cheese btw
the_wait_staff were polite_and quick with_a fresh basket_of garlic or non garlic_naan so_you_can happily wipe your_plate clean
their fruit lassis are suspected
probably made_with flavoring liquor
we_came back_here a_few_days for_dinner as we_couldn't handle cold turkey from_this_place
definitely_have dinner_here
no_buffet during_dinner unfortunately but food_and_service is even_better
i_absolutely_love this_restaurant
they_offer so many_different healthy choices like vegan_and gluten_free foods
their_buffet is_the_best deal ever
because_you try_different delicious healthy foods at_a_very very_good price
the customer_service_is wow
i_feel so welcome every_time i_go_there
the_restaurant_is very_clean_and cute and_all_the employees are so_nice_and genuinely friendly
their bread_is the_best_i've_had
delicious flavorful food_and awesome customer_service
i_also_tried a a_mango_lassi for_the_first_time and_it_was so_yummy
definitely will_be back_here_again
as_usual everything_was_delicious
we_get the watermelon mintini
chicken_tika_masala
palak_paneer
lamb_vindaloo
vegatable raita
and_the bhatura
sp
whatever we_don't finish we bring home_and it_tastes even_better the_next_day
i_wonder how these people_are making money
probably because their customer base is not_indian
thus no_one knows how real_indian food_tastes
the papri chat was insipid
one could_only taste yogurt
no seasoning
in_fact the papri smelled
old
the_entree
malai_kofta_was overwhelmingly sweet
the koftas barely had_any paneer or what_is known as cottage_cheese
which it_is supposed_to have
the
rotis
or flatbread were burnt
we_could barely bite into_it
rather we_had_to pull it apart
these people don't seem_to care their_customers either
we kept waiting_for someone_to come_and take_our_order
we_were very_disappointed with_their food_and_service
the_only_thing_that was_good was_the papad served_at the_very beginning
these people seriously need_to taste their own food and_then change their cook
doesn't seem like the_owners know_the taste_of_the_food that_comes put of_their restaurant's kitchen
i_am_going for only_because i_need_to rate them
i've_only gone for_the_lunch_buffet
every_time we've gone
it_has_been ridiculously crowded
the_restaurant_is small
and_the tables_and chairs are so_close together
the_food_is_good
but_i prefer other buffets
someday i_will_try their dinner_menu to_compare
i_love lal mohan
i_love lal mohan
i_would start and finish with those during lunch_buffet
so gooooooood
for_dinner you_have_to prix fixe it for_sure so_you_can get everything
and_if_you like_spicy ask_for so of_there inferno spice on_the side
if_you_can stand heat like_me you_can_get_a gift card by eating their inferno curry about oz
i_would do_it but i_don't_want_to rob them
i_like them too_much
finally
indian_food_at its most complex and satisfying
and good_value
fun vibe
good_service
normally i_hate buffets
but i_am_going_to eat_here regularly
they_are constantly bringing out fresh_food so the_food hasn't been_sitting there long
it_was very_tasty_and the_price_was very fair
i_am_a local
but_my european friends showed me_this little_gem
as vegas tourists for ten years they_seem_to have_found all the_best_places
the_restaurant_has_a wonderful ambiance
and_great_service
we_had_the vegetarian gluten_free prix fixe
delish
what_a shocking surprise this_place_was
a_wonderful treat
we_were visiting the museum across_the_street
got hungry
and_thought we_would just walk to_the strip_mall across the_way and grab some lunch there
we_couldn't even see this_place at_first
but once_we hit the_parking_lot
we noticed the_sign and_decided_to go_in
we_were_there_for lunch
which
as_others have noted
is a_buffet
and
as_someone who eats and cooks a_lot_of_indian food
i_have_to_say the_buffet_was super generous in_terms of_options and_quality
they_even had_a bin of full sized idli
which_you never seldom get on_the_buffet_line
food_was much better_than average
the naan_was_excellent
and
the selections were original and_refreshing
the_service seems meek almost_like the_waitstaff is afraid to_talk_to you
and
the table_service needed_to complement the_buffet_is a_bit_slow
of_the_two things we_needed from the_waitstaff
the_staff got both items wrong
no biggee
but_still noteworthy
we_did have a_table of_some foul mouthed young men near us who_were talking disrespectfully of women
i_might have_liked it if management had taken_care of_that for_us
but
eventually they_did leave
outstanding lunch_buffet
one_of_the best in_the_city
great_selection
always clean_and immediate seating
great_food
this_place_is_amazing
tasty
affordable
which_is rare for vegas
cool decor
and_excellent customer_service
coming_from san_francisco where there_is many top_notch indian_restaurants this_place definitely meets those standards
they_have_a really_nice lunch_buffet from
pm
great_naan and excellent_service
definitely the_place when_i'm in_town
great work
everything about_this_place_is on_point
every_time_i come_here
either with_my fiance or friends
i_feel_like i_am treated like royalty without_it being overbearing
staff_is_very_friendly
interactive
and professional
food is_incredible
i_always_get a_different dish to_try since everything tastes_like an explosion of_flavor in_your_mouth
garlic_naan
get with butter
well_worth_it
is_a_must
delicious
could_eat this_for my_meal
also
a_nice_little plus for_you spicy_food eaters out_there when_you first open your menu
there_is_an entire page dedicated to
inferno
courses
i_don't_know_if you have_ever_had a ghost chili or_not
but these meals consist of_that and habeneros
on_a_scale of in spicy
most of_them are s
there_is_an inferno curry that gets you_a fifty dollar gift card and_a picture on_the_wall if you successfully eat the_entire meal
after you sign a waiver of_course
i_haven't_had the pleasure
but_the inferno kabobs had my_mouth pleasantly on fire
love_this_place
delicious_food
nice environment
friendly_staff
just a_little_pricey then most indian_food

very_busy
make_reservations
this_was_our second trip_to the bistro for_their gluten_free menu
service_and prices_were good
it_was_a_little more_spicy this_time and we_said we_wanted it_at a_to with_a being_the hottest
would hate to_see what_a would_be
i_know this_is subjective
but_just be_prepared
also
the bistro was filled_with indians with only_one other caucasian couple i_think_that is_huge compliment to how_good and_authentic the_food_is
i_highly suggest the bistro
wow
this_place_is awesome
went_here with_a_friend and_had_the tasting pre fix dinner we couldnt even finish_it
and_for bucks not_bad at_all
came_with appetizer_and desert
cant beat it
best_indian_restaurant_in the_las_vegas
we_were on vacation and_did_not knew where to_eat ready review online and went_there we_were their everyday while_we_were in_las_vegas all i_have_to_say is star restaurant also the_owner came_to our_table_and made_sure everything_was ok
thank_you guys for good_food away from home
nice location
nice_decor
very modern_and straight
and amazing_food
we_had_the indian_dinner for which_was enough_for the_three of_us
attentative service
never_had to_run on empty
authentic_indian and nepalese_food
relaxed atmosphere
friendly_and good humored staff a_complete delight
stopped_in last friday for_the_lunch_buffet
i'm_not very familiar_with_indian_food though i've_always wanted to_try_it and_this_place had_a_good yelp rating so_that's how we_ended_up there
the_food_was_very_good
once_i determined what everything_was and_tried several small_portions
the_servers_were quick to_refill our_water
we_had_a large_party
and_the_restaurant seemed very_clean
not_sure where to_start_with this_place
here_are some_things to note
the_wait situation was_way out_of hand when_we_got there
we_got an_empty promise of mins when we_actually waited mins
the_manager was rude
service overall was_bland like_the_food
i_would_give my money to_india_palace any day
that place_is_the real deal
mint was_delicious
the service_was_prompt and_attentive
the mango_lassis were thick_and tasty
the_neighborhood around_the strip_mall is_a_little rough
we_had_to run the beggar gauntlet on our_way in
but_once you're inside it is_one_of_the nicest indian_restaurants we've been too
do_not miss the_chance_to get away_from_the casinos for a_real meal
if you enjoy indian_food you_will_not_be_disappointed
this_place_has the_best_food that i_have_tasted in_a_long_time
i_love spices_and the combinations are_the_best from let's me decide depending on my_taste_buds
my_fav on_the_menu_is the andhra curry_with shrimp
every_time_i visit vegas
this_is_one_of_my stops before returning home
i've just turned vegan and_i_am still figuring out_what to_eat
a_friend_and i split the_vegan prix fixe dinner
it_was_just wonderful
i_never knew eating vegan could_be this good
i_look_forward_to my_next_visit to_las_vegas
i_will_definitely come_back_to mint_indian_bistro
this_place_is the_best_indian_food_i've_had in_all_of vegas
except it_being super cold in_there
everything_else_was perfect
they_actually make the_food spicy here
we_ordered samosas as an_app
the_tamarind_chutney was the_best_i've_ever_had
for_dinner
i_got_the chicken_tikka_masala at level hot
and_the hubbs got a_veggie khorma at a_level
also supper hot
the_raita
yogurt
was_a smaller order than_i would've liked but it_was_really_good
was_looking_for a_lunch place near_the national atomic testing museum and up popped mint on_yelp
good_choice
the_lunch_buffet_at was_more_than we_are used_to paying but_there_were more and_more varied selections
everything was_good_but be_warned
a_lot_of things_were hot
even_the saag_was hotter than the_chicken_vindaloo
they_have_a large_selection of beers and_wine
including organic choices
and lassi cocktails
the_bill for buffets_and glasses_of loma larga chardonnay came_to
i_wouldn't make a_special trip here if_we return to_las_vegas but_i_can recommend_it if_you_are_in_the area and_have_a hankering for_indian
parking_is very_limited
i_would_recommend car pooling if_you_are coming with_a_group
the_inside is_very quaint
they_even_have a cute little patio
i_went during_the_lunch_buffet and it_was_pretty_good
i_may be butchering the_name_of this because my_phone autocorrected to andrea and_now i_can't_remember what_it_was called
but_the ankur
chicken_curry_was amazing
chicken literally melted in_my_mouth
the_flavor_was perfect
by far my_favorite item
the_chicken chili was_also pretty_good
pieces_of_chicken made_with chopped up chunks_of red and_green bell peppers
reminded me_of chicken jalfrezi
chicken_tikka_masala_was a_different color than i've normally seen
it_was_ok but_i_think i_had_a hard time getting past the_way it_looked
i_just couldn't' eat_it
i_prefer mine to_be_more consistently creamy and_a_little darker in color
this_one_was almost the color of salmon
the_chicken ttandoori was_as_good as i've ever_had before
definitely worth_it
i didn't_see raita on_the_buffet_line
i_probably could_have asked_for_it
but_they_were really busy_and i_didn't_want to_be_a bother
i_guess i_was_really thirsty because_i finished my_first glass_of_water quickly
instead_of refilling it the_server set a carafe of_water on my_table
now_that i_think of_it
he never asked_me what i_wanted_to drink
good_thing i_wanted water because that's_what he_brought me
the_naan could have_been_better
it seemed_to be_a_little dry or hard
i_don't_think it_was fresh
they were_a_lot_of veggie vegan_options and the_ones i_tried were pretty_good
potato
sag aloo and_a_few others
bathrooms are small
only_one stall per sex
that_was_a pretty outstanding indian_buffet
i'm_not giving_it a_perfect five because_it_was a_tad expensive and_the_quality_of_the chicken could've been_better
the soups were superb
nice attentive_service is_well
garlic_naan_was a_good_choice
nice flavor
one_of_the indian restro in_vegas
authentic_food
simply love its aaloo tikki chat
paneer_tikka and chhole
a_bit higher on price as most_of main course dishes cost at least bucks
but trust_me its worth
quite near to the_strip_and airport as_well
thats an added point
they_also have inferno dished if anyone is looking_for
in_short if_you_want quick authentic_indian_food
this_is_the_place
first_indian good_experience
came recommended
was_very_good at_an affordable price
the_food_was_really_good
could_be little_bit better
the paneer_tikka_masala was_less cooked
gulab jamoon was_more chewy
my_personal favorite_was_the chili_chicken
it_was_perfect
bad_food
raw food
on_top_of_that bad_service
avoid this_place unless_you are_so hungry that you_can_eat pretty much anything
it_is difficult_to find a_place_to satisfy my girlfriends and_i since we_have_a vegan
a picky eater
and someone who_has never_tried other ethnic foods besides mexican and american
it_was_pretty pack considering it_was late sunday evening
however
we_were_able_to get_a_table right away_and the_food_came_out fast
they_have_a huge_menu that_is also vegan gluten_free friendly
i_guess all indian_food
the_menu_is well organized and laid out_with symbols next_to each_dish to_help the diners that_have diet restrictions
almost every_dish can_be made into vegan or vegetarian
they_also have chicken
tofu
and_cheese options
we_ordered_the onion cilantra paratha
organic veggie_samosas
mighty momos with veggie
chicken_tikka_masala
hot level it_was_not spicy
mixed chef's killer kabob
organic alo gobi masala
monterey jack cheese_naan and lastly mango and pistachio kulfi for deserts
not_bad dish
everything was_very_good including their chutneys
i_do wish they_gave more rice since they_only gave us small bowls to_share between people
they_seemed to_be reasonbly priced
our_server
ronald was_great_and very_helpful
the_ambience of_the_place was_nice
too
it_was relaxing and calming
you_know it's a_good_indian restraunt when it_is packed_with indian diners
overall
we_are very_happy and can't_wait_to go_back
first_time_here
had samosas
vertical vindaloo with boneless lamb
cool raita a strawberry lassi
everything_was_delicious
hot
pleasantly spiced not too_spicy
i_could_have had spicier but_not necessary
i_also_had garlic_naan which wasn't crazy good buy delicious nonetheless
i_want_to come here_for_the_lunch sometime when_i'm free
it_really is_outstanding
what an_amazing culinary experience
the_flavors_of the_food are vibrant
the_spicy noodle soup was_amazing with each spoonful better_than_the last
it's a_vegetarian delight
huge gluten_free menu
the_food_was_really great
and_it_was cool that_they_had vegan_options
the service_was_ok
but_they took_forever_to seat us even_though_the restaurant wasn't_that crowded and_there_was only_one party ahead of_us
excellent_indian_food
had_the_tandoori chicken_and_the saang with_lamb
the_chicken cooked_perfectly
the saang had big chunks_of flavorful lamb
not overpoweringly gamey
the_garlic_naan
awesome
they_also have an_extensive beer collection
its a_small_place and_its pretty busy so_i recommend making a_reservation
we_waited about_minutes
but it_was_worth_it
this_is my_go_to spot_for indian_food_in_vegas
a
for the_dosa
lassi's
and_the_service
on a_separate occasion we_took in laws
from_india
for_the_lunch_buffet
they_said it_was_the_best they've had in_a_long_time
i would_love_to see_them offer_a chinese dosa or genie dosa
one_of_the_best_indian_restaurants
i_have_been_to
hopefully they open one up in_san jose
naan_was_fresh
vegetarian curries_are well_made and_spiced to excellence
i_want_to give
for_this_restaurant
ambience_is also_very_good
i_would_recommend it_to my_friends visiting las_vegas
i_don't ever_go out for_indian_food
seeing that i_can just make_it at_home and_most_of the_time restaurants just_don't do indian_food any justice
but mint_is really true to_the_indian flavors
it's_just like_my grandmothers homemade food
really_enjoy their_lunch_buffet
but lunch is_always busy so_be patient
i_didn't give them stars bc the_service isn't great
i had_dinner with_my
family there and_the_service_was awful
the_food_is_awesome
really what_i expected
nice_ambiance too
we_ordered for different fried_rice
and_all items_were too good
best restaurant for_indian_food
tried veg dinner_for option
its expensive but food_was_good
sampler has curries almost_all are_good
dal is average
overall food_is_good_and service_is_good
oh mint how i_love you
best_service and best_food
my_husband_and_i have_been_going here_since we_first started dating and_now our two kids even love_it
forever a_mint lover
finding mint_indian_bistro is_like finding an oasis in the_desert
where_the oasis would_be_a really_good_indian restaurant_and_the desert
well
is las_vegas
my experiences are based on dinner and_not_the lunch_buffet
their staff_is_very accommodating here_and are experienced in dealing with large families and groups with small children
on busy evenings
you_can flag down any of_their waitstaff for assistance
i've never made a_reservation here_and have_not waited more_than minutes during_my last few visits
i_love_the extensive and_almost daunting menu filled_with northern and southern_indian dishes
we_usually start_off with_some samosas and_the bhel_puri
which is_an_indian snack food_made of puffed rice
i always_have to_get garlic_naan_with my meals
the_naan_is an_indian flat_bread that's served hot out_of_the oven and_has_a wonderful texture
the_bread is_great_for sopping up the_sweet curry_sauce of_their tikka_masala
another dish to_try is_the smoky and aromatic lamb_dish called rogan_josh
if you're adventurous
they_have plenty of_other delicious dishes to_choose_from_and also serve vegetarian fare
we_went there_for_dinner
we_ordered idli
chana_masala
chicken_curry_and man
they_were_all bad
the_food_is expensive in_general and for_the_food they_serve
the_prices_are outrageous
i'm from arizona and_i_thought i_knew good_indian_food until i_went_to mint
oh_my goodness this_place_was so_great
first walking_in
the_ambiance was quaint and_comfortable
the_servers_were very_friendly
i_have_a gluten_free vegan diet and i_was_surprised how_many vegan_and organic options they_have on_the_menu
the_food_was incredible i_couldn't believe_it was vegan
definitely_going to_dine here_again
great_experience
really good_food_and very reasonable_prices
i'll be_back
awesome_food
andhra chicken_and chicken chilly was_very_good
i desert mango_custard and gulab_jamun were_good
they_served hot_naan
nana were soft_and very_good
i didnt tried anything in veg
but friends liked vegetarian too
fantastic indian_food
i_tried_the minced chicken uttapam
really_well made_and fills you_up pretty well
the_ambience_is fantastic and_the_service_is courteous too
i_think this_is_one_of_the greatest indian_restaurants_in_vegas
i end_up eating_here all_three dinners while_we_were in_vegas
this_place_has extensive_menu
most_indian_restaurants i_have_been_to
with extensive_menu items_are not so_great
once
we_ordered lamb_chops
fried idli
biryani
chicken kadai
different_types_of parathas
various lassis
vegetarian grill stuff
etc
we_didn't leave_a peace
we_just liked all the_items
last but_not_the least
the_staff_are also courteous
don't_come_here alone
there's no seating and_they won't give up_a booth for one_person
i_would_never recommend_this_place_to whoever is looking_for authentic_indian_food
it's not_at_all close_to traditional_indian taste n palette
we_went after checking a_few reviews but_as they_say
don't judge_a book_by its cover
was_so true
we_tried mumbai pav bhaji and the_only way to_describe it_was
urghhhh
what did_i order
folks from mumbai will_be thoroughly disappointed
the_only_thing i_would_recommend n give_stars was_the bhindi kurkure or okra fritters they_were_good
so my_friends after_a_long drive to_vegas if u r looking_to relax the_evening with a_good_indian dinner don't_go this_way
great off strip choice that_is allergen friendly
all_the options on_the_buffet are clearly labeled and so_many choices are_both gluten dairy free
gf breads only available_for dinner_buffet but_no shortage of carbs
discounted prices_for the_kids are_much appreciated
i_like_the blend_of both north and_south_indian choices
i've_been_to indian times_and this_food_is fabulous
the_restaurant full_of indians seem_to agree
will_definitely eat_here again next_time i'm_in_vegas
we love_this_place
every_time_we have_gone the_food_and_service have_been amazing
you_can pretty much choose anything on_the_menu_and be assured that's its_good
we enjoy taking out_of_town guests here
of_all_the_indian food places_in_vegas
this_is_my_favorite
my_wife_and_i came_in_for the_buffet_and it_was_excellent
the_food_is mildly spiced just the_way_i like
there_are_a strong variety_of_indian dishes to_choose_from
the_tikka_masala_was delicious
i_enjoyed_the veggie khurma also
we_have_been disappointed several_times with_indian_food places_in_vegas
this_is is_a_must_try
would_recommend to my_friends
stopped in_for_the_lunch_buffet after_a morning of golf
on_the recommendation of some_of_my indian coworkers
what a_great_find
the_food_was reasonably_priced_and tasted_great
a_little spicier_than most_of_the indian_restaurants_i've_been_to
but that_doesn't bother me
the_buffet_was pretty big i_really_like_the chicken_korma_and tika_masala
and_the galob jamon for_dessert was everything_i hoped it_would_be
we_had_a mango_lassi
and_a cherry lassi for_the_first_time ever both were_really_good
can't_wait_to_go_back_and order_off_the regular_menu
came here_for_the_lunch_buffet
i_do_not know_if the_food_here would_be considered authentic
but_i_think the_food_is_delicious_and i was_not_disappointed at_all
i_would_recommend_this_place
very_good_indian_food
nann was thin_and delicious
might just_be my_favorite_indian_restaurant
it's_been a_while since_i've treated my inner indian
so i_tried_this based on yelp_reviews
i was_not_disappointed
ordered an_appetizer of samosas
they_were_not quite as crispy_and bursting with_flavor as the_ones i_remember from_my early years in south africa
but_would definitely_have them_again
ordered_the_lamb karma korma for the_entree
i_asked_for the mild spice
since_i don't normally like_the really hot dishes
but_i probably could_have gone with_the medium_spice
flavors_were well blended with_a hint_of sweetness
accompanied it with_a_side_of garlic_naan
perfect_for mopping up_the left_over sauce
i'll definitely come_back_again when_i'm in_town
this_is_an update from my_last review
the dine_in buffet_at after noon is_good
been several_times for_the_lunch_buffet
staff_is helpful_and friendly in pointing out vegan_options
very_tasty
if even a_bit greasy_and salty
the
one tea bag tea is a_bit_pricey though
i'll stick with_the_buffet option from now on
what's up_with_the staff asking_for my_phone and e addy simply to_place me in_the que for_a_table
it's_quite a_nice restaurant though
especially considering_the strip_mall it's_in is_not so hot
i've been craving_indian curry_for the longest
and_mint always satisfies my
fix
service
our_waiter_was patient and answered every question i_had
refilled our_drinks in_a timely manner
offered rice when_i_was running low
he was_awesome
food
we_ordered chicken_tandoori
lamb_korma
garlic_naan_and lamb_samosa
chicken was_cooked perfect
succulent white and_flavorful
korma_was so_good_that i_took_a piece_of bread_to scrape off the_last drop
garlic_naan
who doesn't like garlic bread
the_samosa was_ok
nothing_to rave about but_still completes the_experience
i_can't_wait_to try their_lunch_buffet
if_your on_the_east side_of_town
come check_this_place out
told fianc i been_wanting indian_food for_a_while
we_decided_to head this_way after_the gym considering it_was_just down_the_street
service_was_great
at no_time did they try_to
rush us_and was helpful patient when_we_were deciding on what_to_order
refilling our waters and_even offering more basmati_rice when_we_were out
as far_as food
we ordered_lamb samosas to_start_with
a_bit dry_and needed some type_of sauce but_still_good
our_entrees were chicken_breast tandoori for_me_and lamb_korma for my_date
we also_ordered their infamous garlic_naan
i_love anything on_a sizzling plate
the_chicken_was moist_and tender
my_dish was_not spicy_at_all
which_is_a plus for_me because_i can't handle tooo spicy
paired perfectly with_the basmati_rice_and i_even made a_little sandwich bite with_the_naan
grilled onions
cut the_chicken up_and topped with yogurt_sauce
delish
the_korma was_a
and i_guess_it wasn't too_spicy either but_he likes spice so
he said_he might go
next_time
they_also have_an inferno menu where you_have_to sign waivers
i_wonder how serious that_is
lol
overall a_great_experience
wish_we had room for_dessert
until next_time
yum
definitely one_of_my_favorite places to_grab a_quick lunch
super close_to unlv and the_strip
very accessible
they_usually have_a_lunch_buffet which_is_a great_price and if_you_are_a unlv student you'll get like a_discount as_well
the_food_is_delicious_and their is_a_large variety_of items_in their_buffet
they of_course serve naan as_well
my_personal favorite_is_the garlic_naan because who doesn't love garlic
each_time_i have came they_have always_been super attentive_and great_with customer_service as_well
love_their bone in goat_curry
paneer
actually any paneer dish
tiki_masala
and_you gotta get_a lassi drink
especially_if it's your first_time at an_indian_place
definitely a_good_choice if_you're_in_the neighborhood
over_priced food that_isn't worth_the hype
we_ordered_the variety platter for_two that included appetizers_and dessert because we_wanted_to_try as_much food_as possible
their_tandoori_chicken is_really_good
but_nothing else_was impressive
our search for_the_best indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas continues
my_boyfriend surprised me_on valentines day_and took_me to_this_restaurant
it's_been awhile since_i had indian_food_and so_far this_is_one_of_my favorites
i_haven't try_their kabobs but_the curry's are to_die_for
i_will_definitely come_and dine here_again
the_servers_were so_nice
really delicious_indian_food and_good_service
some_of_the best saag i've_had_in_a while and_chicken_tikka_masala had a_rich hearty sauce
will_definitely go_back
i_haven't_had indian_food_this good since_i left chennai
india
everything_was amazing from the_naan_bread to_the spicy_chicken
even_the indian_beer
i_highly_recommend_this_place
the_food_was_great and the_service_was_also
it's_a_small and unique feeling atmosphere at_the mint_indian_bistro especially_when the_place_is full
which seems_to be most_of_the time
it_might_be because_the_food almost takes you to_india with_the wonderful smell_of curry
garlic_naan and_tikka_masala in_the air
we_had_a special valentine's dinner_at the mint_indian_bistro and will_definitely dine there_again
maybe we'll bring friends
but_if we_all start doing that_the secret will_get out and_you'll never get_a_table
i recommend_you try_this jewel of_a spot and predict you'll be hooked too
my_husband_and_i had_no_idea what_to_expect
we_are not_familiar_with indian_food_but the_menu_and the_reviews were_super enticing
for a_person with_lots_of good restrictions this_place_is_a gem
the_staff_is so helpful_and knowledgable of_all their_food
our_meal was_delicious
can't_wait_to try_more on_their massive menu
my_wife_and_i have been_wanting_to try_a_new indian_place for_a_while now
and omg are we happy we chose mint
everything_was beyond delicious
seriously there_are_no words
i_ate until it hurt and it_was_worth_it
counting the days until_we can go_back
this_place_has good indian_buffet
my all_time favorite when ever i_am_in_vegas
i_am_an indian
love_the_food here
homemade fresh
woooo
th reviewer
i've_been_here twice now the_first_time for_dinner_and the_second_time for_the_lunch_buffet
i'll just_go over_the overall points
generally good_service
sometimes the waiters_are awkward and_there_was one young fellow in particular who looked_like he hated his job
everyone_is knowledgeable in_the_food and readily answers questions though
which_is_great for_me because_i barely know anything about_indian_food
the_food_is bomb and_i'm seriously craving_it right_now
one_time
the_chicken in the_chicken marsala was_dry though
so that_was strange
but_overall
everything_is seasoned to how i_like_it
a rare occurrence
and_i_was delightfully surprised_by_the mango yogurt
so_good
outside_of_the lunch_buffet
it's_a_little overpriced but_you get_a_good amount_of_food made_with quality_ingredients and care
i like_that_they label things in categories like vegan or gluten_free
very_helpful for_those who_have limited diets
my_favorite_was probably this lamb_dish during_the_lunch_buffet which i_cannot remember but_i assure you
it_was_awesome
i_love the_garlic_naan
which_i wish came_in some heated basket
in_my dreams
because it_gets cold so fast
tastes so_much_better warm
great_location by unlv and_i'm trying to_get_a group to_eat lunch there with_me right_now
at_the_end_of a_long day the_of_us who all love_indian_food decided that's what_we_wanted
we_waited the minutes they told_us it would_take for_our take_out and_the_food_was exceptional
i esp like_the option_of hot spice_in a_scale
nice folks too
if_i_could give more_than stars i certainly would
indian good is_absolutely one_of_my_favorite cuisines
and_the mint_is most definitely_the_best in_vegas
i_have dined at nearly all_the_indian_restaurants around_town and_as_a concierge it_is my job to_know the_best_places to_dine in_the_city
i_always refer my guests here_for_the authentic amazing_food and genuine service
i_can't_wait until my_next dining_experience
if_you_like to try_new_things i_highly_recommend one_of_the tasting experiences you_will_not_be_disappointed
i_probably wouldn't_have ever ventured out to_mint if_it weren't for_my vegan friends but_i'm glad that_i_did
i_have_no concerns when_it_comes_to food except_for my slight lactose intolerance but_if_you_are one of_those who_are vegetarian
vegan
or have any_kind_of dietary restrictions
mint_is the_spot for_you
the_first page of_the_menu explains what every symbol beside each entree means
so_if_you don't_eat meat
dairy
gluten
nuts
and etc
mint has you covered
see photo below
our_orders were taken on_an ipad mini where every possible alteration to_any dish_is already programmed into the_app that they_use
i_believe that_they also_have an_app that_you_can download on_your smart phones to_order before coming into the_restaurant
sweet
nice to_see_a restaurant seeking out new ways to better service their guests
not something you_see everyday in_most restaurants
food_was_excellent
the_vegan tikka_masala_was great
i_also_tried my friend's potato curry_which_was good_but i_am_a carnivore so_i probably would've enjoyed one_of_their meat curries a_bit_more
heard great things_about their_lunch_buffet so i_will_definitely have to_come_back for_that
can't_wait
very_nice customer_service
i wish_we would've just gone_to our old standby tamba which_was not_even a block from_the hotel
but the_wife
who never wants_to try anything new
wanted to_try_a new_indian_restaurant
the_service_was somewhat inattentive
we_had hot supposedly chai_tea
but no_one brought out any_kind_of sweetener until we_requested some
i should've had_a_nice cold taj_mahal beer
the_food_was_just fair with_the standout being the_malai_kofta
the_tandoori mixed_grill
lamb_and swordfish
and_saag_paneer were_pretty bland
i've_had way better_food back_home in maryland
they spoiled me rotten apparently
next_time we're in_vegas_and want_indian we know_where not to_go
very_good restaurant
we_had mostly south_indian_food
food_was_delicious
service_was_ok but_they_were bit crowded n able to_accommodate our big group with_little time
my_favorite place_to_eat as_always ron gives wonderful customer_service
the_mango masala without nuts due_to allergy
they_also carry around a ipad so_that you_could see_the picture of_the_food and they_will describe the_flavors
oh how i_love_this_place
always_a great_atmosphere
good greetings and_service that you_would_expect from higher end restaurants
very_well run and_the_food overall is_by_far_the_best_indian i've_had
am from_india
cheers
try_the lamp stir fry with_your kingfisher beer
awesome combo with_the spicy lamb and_beer
went_for_lunch buffet it was_just_ok
i've definitely had_better
chicken_tikka_masala_was dry
even_though_it was buried in gravy
pakora was burnt to_a crisp
fresh garlic_naan brought_to table was_wonderful so_was_the tandoori_chicken juicy and_flavorful
we_have_been here one_other time
but_we think_it_was even_better this_time round
took some_friends and_they loved_it as_much as we_did
the_flavors
the regions
all_the fresh_and organic ingredients
really made_the food outstanding
good staff that_is helpful in ordering the_right combination_of dishes
delicious_and would_recommend it highly and priced right
the_lunch_buffet has gotten so_good here
oh_my my a_fantastic
large
and_well executed selection_of_vegetarian and non_veg buffet_items
a thicker tikka_masala curry
both veg_and chicken
than_their previous recipe
a_long row of creative curries
even chicken_vindaloo
full disclosure this_was probably my th time_eating the_lunch_buffet here_and i_have_never liked_it as_much as_this trip
i_actually stopped coming_here because_i felt there_was_a lack_of selection_and no variety
always the_same buffet_items
the_last_time_i came_here was_in_the summer of
we_were driving by_and hungry and_a what the_hell moment ensued
we_went_to mint for_the_first_time in almost a_year
clearly lots has improved
and_i_am a_huge_fan
the_mt
everest indian_restaurant on_sahara has a_lot to live up_to now
i've_eaten at_mt
everest close_to times
mint is_my_new favorite indian_lunch_buffet spot in_las_vegas
no contest
i_really_enjoy their_lunch_buffet
every_time_i eat_here
i leave full_and satisfied
i good place_to_eat for_sure
if_you_live or are visiting_vegas this_is_a_must
the_food_was_amazing and well_priced
i_was dining with_a vegan_and though_i don't typically eat vegetarian or vegan the_food_was_amazing and i_couldn't tell the_difference
bold flavors
a foodie paradise
we_had_the vegan tasting menu all was_really_good
except the_desert
some_things just can't_be vegan sorry lol
torn between giving a and_a for_my score
going_to consider it_a
rounded up_for quality
was_craving_indian and_saw a_bunch_of elites raved about_this_place
so it_made the_top_of my_list despite being further than i_wanted_to travel
called in my_order for_takeout and headed on over
upon entering
saw_that the_restaurant_itself was_a_bit nicer and_more upscale than_i_expected
service_was_a_bit lackluster waited_for a_bit at the_door before being acknowledged
my boxed food_was waiting at a_table with_a manager looking guy_who brought over my receipt and took_my card with_a series of gestures
then ran my card and disappeared without_a thank_you or asking if_i needed anything else
that probably explains why_i didn't_get any utensils or napkins
nor did_i add on another side or additional naan_as i'd originally planned
and_there_were only_two tables seated at
pm so it's_not because they_were_busy
i_found_this place_to_be a_bit_pricey
i_like_that half size entrees_are available for_a slightly lesser fee
but found_that the decrease in pricing
usually around
isn't worth_the decrease in product
lesson learned
for_three half size entrees
one container of_rice was provided
also_ordered one garlic_naan
total was around
which is_a_bit steep
i always_have difficulty paying so high_for a_la_carte indian_food when the_buffet prices_are so cheap for so_much
i_feel_like there's_a discrepancy there that_should result in lower prices rather than higher
but whatever
quality made my_entree choices worthwhile
saag_paneer
baingan bharta
and lamb_korma
the_saag was_decent but_i prefer mine a_little saucier
this_one_was a_lot_of spinach_and good sized cubes_of paneer but the_dish seemed as_if it hadnt been cooked down long enough
best eaten with the_garlic_naan
which_was fragrant and_delicious
baingan bharta was ordered exclusively based on recommendations here on_yelp
and_i was_not_disappointed
it_was flavorful_and i_appreciated that the_sauce_was on_the thicker side
which allowed for_it to_go well_with_the rice
the_lamb_korma is_the_only dish_that had_any spice to_it whatsoever
and_it_was quite mild despite ordering_a at thai restaurants
that'll get_you a_spicy dish
but_i_guess indian_is a_little_more laid back_with the scale
i_know now for next_time
dish didn't_have quite as_much lamb as expected for_a portion
speaking of portions
i_was_a_little confused by_the portions_and packing of_my takeout
i_appreciated that the_half size entree portions_were packed in plastic lidded containers and wrapped in plastic to ensure that nothing spilled
but the_size_of the_portions themselves were_on the_small side think_the smallest hummus containers at the_grocery
that size
going_to put this_on the_list to try_again for_the_lunch_buffet
thinking that will_be_a better value_and possibly a_better overall experience
good_quality
vast menu of_options including several vegetarian_dishes
atmosphere
modern_and clean but_also cozy at the_same_time
service
excellent to_the_point where the_waiter seemed_like he_was always there
but_hey
it's better_than trying to_flag down waiters
food
we_got_the pre fixe dinner_for
there_was so_much_food
it_was essentially a dinner_for
i_like_the pre fixe because you_can_try a_little_bit_of_everything without getting a_full a_la_carte sized dish
the_dishes here_are solid and_fresh
excellent_service and_an extensive_menu
great_value in_all ways
we like_it
pretty yummy
love_their daal makhni garlic_naan
hmmm
quick
buffet_style lunch
the_wait_staff_is very_pleasant and_attentive
we_have_been dying to_come_here
glad_we finally did
taste_buds are pleasantly pleased
your constant companion
deirdra
as_a guru indian
this_is_the_best indian_food_in_vegas
don't waste_your time going anywhere else
lunch_buffet_was great
not_too pricey as_well
freshly prepared garlic_naan_was great_too
vegetarian_options are little_bit less but_i_guess how_much one vegetarian can_eat
it's okay
i_would_give three and half stars to_this_place
count my four_stars as three and half really
the inferno menu_is no joke
i_eat all kinds_of spicy_food
i grind my_own trinidad scorpion moruga
ghost
and habanero mix
i_got crushed by_the inferno curry
i_had_to stop halfway through my_meal due_to_a stomach ache from_the seven tablespoons of ghost chili powder that they_use in_the meal
the food_tasted delicious and_the_service_was_great
i_have become a_fan_of east indian_food_and mint_indian_bistro did_not_disappoint
the_goat_curry and the_eggplant curry were_delicious
they of_course had other curries
the_service_was_excellent
they_could be_more friendly
however
they_were_not
standoffish
this is_a_must_try in_vegas
yummy
during_lunch they_offer_a buffet and_have about different entrees ranging_from vegetarian to those with meat
gluten_free options_and a_variety_of sauces_and accompaniments
this_is_a_great way to_sample different_dishes without having to_order_the entire restaurant
but
indian_food_is not for_those with_a low tolerance for_spicy
hot
food
the fresh_naan is_wonderful and_great for_dipping in these flavorful dishes because most entrees do contain a_good_amount_of heat
probably on_a thai scale
worth checking_out and_they open at am which reservations aren't really recommended till after pm
love_this_place
the_staff_is always pleasant_and the_food_is_delicious
being a_vegetarian
they_have tons_of amazing options
i_always leave here full_and happy
this_was definitely the_best_indian_food_i've had_in_a_long while
went with_some coworkers while at_a conference and was_impressed_with the_dish selection
descriptions to aid some_of_the folks in_the group who hadn't had much indian_food
and_the helpful service
in_a sea of glitz and glamour on_the_strip
this_was_a refreshing winner
the_lunch_buffet is_one_of_the_best indian_lunch_buffets i've ever_had
with_a_great mixture_of meat
veg
and vegan_dishes so_many if them were_delicious
the_tandoori_chicken_was covered_in grilled onions_and lemon wedges
awesome
the_garlic_naan_was soft
warm
flavorful_and the_size_of a_side plate
and_the rices were perfectly_cooked
the_goat was_tasty if_you_like the_flavor_of goat
there_was_also_a dessert called gulab_jamun which_was like donut holes soaked in syrup
each bite was like_a juicy sweet sex party in_my_mouth lol
the_only_thing_i wished was_that_the signage for_the_buffet items was_more detailed
some_of_the names meant nothing to_me
i_might not've tried the_gulab because i_thought_it_was either a floating fruit or some_kind_of egg
lol
try_this_place
it's great
if_you_are looking_for the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
your search ends here
this_is_one_of_the few_indian places_that nails it_down on quality
taste
service
ambiance_and price
went_here_for a weekend lunch_buffet
priced_at
person
it_is unbeatable good quality_indian_food
you_could tell by_the sheer number_of indian folks eating_here and_the long queue of_those waiting to get_a_table
the_buffet_had a varied collection of_items including appetizers
salads
four veg
four non_veg curries
rice_and dessert
some top show stoppers were vegetable_korma
paneer
idli sambar
veg pakoras
bhelpuri and_naan
food_was flavourful
hot_and_fresh
unlike many_places where dishes just keep sitting for long on buffet racks
each curry tasted authentic
distinct from another and cooked_to_perfection
also tried_their masala tea
not included in_the_buffet
and it_was_good
service_was fast
attentive_and_friendly and_this_is despite_the rush on_a busy saturday afternoon
decor_is simple yet pleasing to_the eyes
for_those of_you
who might be tempted to_try many_other low priced indian_buffets_in town
mostly at or
trust_me this_one might_be_a little_pricey but_it_is top value_for your dollar
this_place serves delicious_food_and has_great ambiance service
tip
lunch_hour gets real crowded on sat sun
so ditch the_long waiting time
sometimes upto mins for_a_table inside_and mins for_an outside seating
by making_it for an_early lunch
also
if_you_are_not used_to having_indian_food
this could prove to_be a_little_on_the spicy side for_you
so what could improve
this is_for_the restaurant owner management staff
do away with those paper cup glasses
they look cheap_and take away the charm from the_entire food_experience
including a_drink in_the_buffet like tea or mango_lassi can help you beat_the competition that_comes at_a similar price
after spending a_week in_vegas on_the_strip
a_few_of us wanted_to unwind with_a more flavoured meal_in quieter surroundings
we_could not_have picked a_better place the_decor_is fine
and_it_is a_very relaxing environment a far cry from_the hustle and bustle of_the_strip
we started_with popadoms and samosa chat
for the_mains we_had goat biryani
makhni daal
karahi chicken and_garlic_naan
it_was_all very_well prepared_and presented
the 'hot' dishes were_a_bit mild for_my_taste
but_after a_week of_eating at_the hotels
it_really was_a joyous dinner
the_service_was absolutely top_notch and waiters made_sure we_were looked after without being over imposing
all_in all_a great_place_to_go and_eat when in_vegas if you're looking_for great_food_and the opportunity_to unwind
food_was_tasty
they_had_a good_buffet
i_liked_the mango_custard too
went twice for_lunch_buffet
food_was_okay
idly was_not_good
liked curd and mango_custard
easily the_best_indian place_in_vegas
amazing dishes_and killer naan
the_friendly service_here is_always_a welcome bonus
try anything here
you'll love_it
i_came_here around
on_a_saturday_night and_was surprised_at how_busy it_was
every table_was full or had reservations except_for one table outside_and a_small two person table top inside
my_friend_and_i chose_the small table top inside because the_outside area didn't_look too appetizing
i_ordered_the pakoda as_an_appetizer for_the_first_time
i_usually order the_samosas even_though_i am not_a_huge_fan
the pakoda was fried and had_a_nice flavor but_i_didn't taste much indian spice
i_also ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
malai_kofta
garlic_naan
and_mango_lassi
all_of_the curries_were solid
my_only_complaint_is that_everything came out luke warm except_for_the garlic_naan
the_garlic_naan came out piping_hot_and i had_to_wait a_while until i_was_able_to tear it_because it_was_not cut
mango_lassi was_one_of_the_best i_have_had and even_though_i was_full i drank all_of_it
best_indian i_have_tried in_vegas but portions_are kind of small_for_the_price point
i've_been_to mint times about_half the_time for_lunch_buffet and half for_dinner
tonight
we_stopped for_dinner to_try_their new_menu
note
they_have many new items_on_the_menu and_they continue_to have_their original items
the_first page of_the new_menu is_the inferno menu
all dishes on_this page are made_with ghost peppers
you_have_to sign a waiver before eating from_this menu our_server rs told_us
there's one challenge that_if_you finish
you get_your photo on_their wall of fame and_you_get a_mint gift card for future use
i_don't_think it's accepted by_any hospitals
michael k
this might be something you'd want_to try
in_addition
the_new menu_has soups and salads and appetizers of various kinds
there_are_so many_things to_try_it seems_like a_good uye with or people to_share the_items
for tonight
i_chose the vertical vindaloo with_lamb
the_menu change also allows you to_order vindaloo_and choose the protein you_want cheese
lamb
veggies
goat
bone in
swordfish
shrimp and you_choose your spiciness from to
i_chose
and i_could_have had_more spice
or next_time
my_wife ordered the_maharaja tikka_masala_with chicken_breast
again choice_of protein similar_to the_vindaloo
she chose a spiciness_of
we also_got an_order_of buttered garlic_naan
everything_was excellent
the_vindaloo had_good spicy flavor and_the_sauce was_very_flavorful
there_were cut potatoes in_the_sauce
too
my_wife enjoyed her dinner_and she_also expressed that_it could_be spicier
wow
are we going_to or next_time
what happened_to my gabacha
the_naan_was the_tastiest we've_had here
it_wasn't quartered like_other times_but served_in one large round that_we tore apart
after_dinner
she got khir and_i pistachio kulfi
i've_had the khir before_and while good
i_wanted_to_try something different
the pistachio ice_cream was_really
really_good
i_asked rs if_it_was made in house or could i_go_to the_indian store and get_it out_of_the freezer
sure enough
it's made in house
there goes that idea for a_repeat
rs was_quite a_pleasant server
he refilled my iced_tea when_i_was getting low and he_gave us chance to_look over the_menu with_no hurry and_then was ready_to answer any questions
i_have a_couple_of other_indian_restaurants to_try
but for_me
either for_lunch_buffet or_dinner
mint tops all_the others
it is_very_good
best_indian indian_food in_all_of vegas if_not anywhere
incredible beer_selection and staff_is on_it
good prices_for great_food
currently sitting here_in mint writing this_review
we organized a_group to_come and try_the inferno challenge
we_arrived_at pm so the_non challengers could_have the_buffet_and when the_dinner_menu started at pm the challenge could take place
on arrival we_told the_staff our plans
mins after arrival they inform us they_don't_have the_ingredients for_the challenge
so wasted trip for_us
no retribution offered
just told to_call them in a_week to_see_if they_have it_again
the buffet_is_great
lamb_korma_and chicken_tikka_masala are_my faves and_it_is included_in the_lunch_buffet
the_interior of_the_place makes you_feel_like you're in_a fine_dining restaurant
prices_were reasonable
i_will_be_coming back
this_is_the_best_indian_food in_las_vegas
hands down
i travel all_of_the world and_i'm careful saying something is_good versus the_best
if_your used_to eating trash indian_food
you won't like_this_place
this_is real indian_food
you_can am as judge an_indian_restaurant by the_number_of indians that come_here as guests
every_time_i come_here there_are indian families here
the_best_part about_it
it's off_the_strip only mins and_most people_are locals
i_have_been coming_here_for years_and seen these guy seen these_guys grow
they_have_a huge beer_list
exotic
beer
gluten_free options
wife is gluten_free so this_place always is_a_must
they_are_a hard working family that waits on every table regardless of who your server is
i've_eaten here_about times as its always consist
they_will also click a taxi for_you that_can get_there in about mins so_no worries coming back
if_you_have or_more
plan_on reservations
i_went_to mint on a_recent trip_to_vegas
i_had_been there during_my last trip and_was so_happy with_their food_that_i decided_to_go back_there
it_was_a wise decision
d
my_family_and i_had meals there during this trip
the_first was lunch_buffet
they_have so_many dishes in_the_buffet and_all_of them taste excellent
the idli was_super fluffy_and the coconut_chutney tasted_great
pakoda was_super crispy_and was_made with_all kinds_of vegetables
chilli_chicken was supremely tasty
came_back very_satisfied
happy_and ready_to gamble some_more
the_second_time we_went_for_dinner and_again we_were_not_disappointed
we_had fried okra crispy fried okra chips
i_had_never eaten this before_and thoroughly_enjoyed it
the_food we_ordered was_really_good
roti
mushroom mutter
served_with rice
and idli sambar
the_waiter serving us_was super_nice_and accommodated our change request after we_had placed our_order
excellent customer_service topped over excellent_food is_a_great combination
will_definitely go there_again on my_next trip_to_vegas
the_atmosphere of_the_restaurant was_a_little strange at_first
as_soon_as_we walked_in
the_staff seemed a_bit surprised to_see us
they_were friendly and_courteous
but_i got this
uh oh
vibe
once we_were_seated and started looking over the_menu
things settled into_a
ahh
vibe
looking through_a menu_for food_that i'm_not super familiar_with can_be_a_bit daunting
but i_went_with what_i know about_indian_food
majaraja tikka_masala
vindaloo
naan
saag_and rice
can't_go_wrong
we_were given an_appetizer on_the house i forget what it's called and forgive my ignorance but_they_were like super thin taco shells with_a mint sauce_and chutney
really_great
we_enjoyed them
then the_main_dishes arrived
everything_tasted awesome
their tikka_masala_is a_bit_more tangy than i_am_used_to
but it_was_delicious
vindaloo_was spicy
level
in_a good way
not_a burn on_the_way out way
we_were devouring our_food
nearby patrons were ordering lassi drinks but_i_was afraid that combo of lassi_and curries would lock me up_in_the bathroom for too_long
i'm_really happy_with our_experience here_and would_definitely visit_again during a_long term vegas stay
i_went_here to_meet up_some friends_for late_lunch and surprisingly
there_was still a_wait at
pm
they_have_an ipad by the_door so_you_can put your name down_and the_number_of people_in your party
i_waited minutes which_isn't bad
we_came_here for_the_lunch_buffet since_i've been hearing good_things
our_naan took a_rather long time but_at least they_gave us unlimited garlic_naan
there's another_indian_restaurant a_few miles away from_here that also_has a_lunch_buffet but that_place turned me_off when they_kept giving me excuses as_to why they can't give_me garlic_naan
i
e
we ran out_of garlic
when there's_a supermarket right behind them
this_place_is in_a better location_and looks nicer and cleaner
the_service_is better too
for_less_than for_a_buffet
you can't_go_wrong
i_liked that there's a_good_variety_of dishes for_their_lunch_buffet
tikka_masala
palak_paneer
tofu
veggies
spicy_chicken
curry and_other savory dishes
their gulab_jamun was_just_right hot
sweet_and cheesy balls
yum
the_food_was_excellent
hooray for huge chunks_of_chicken
the_sauces_were spot_on
there_was this mystery dish_that we_all tried without reading_the label was_it cheese or was_it tofu
it_was_the texture of cubed mozzarella without_the stomach ache inducing property of cheese on somebody who's lactose intolerant
so
it probably was tofu
i'll definitely come_back_again and_again
the_staff_was awesome
they seated_us in_minutes even thought we_didn't have a_reservation
the_food_was as_usual amazing
i_would come_back_again
i_loved_the mango_lassi
and_the pineapple curry
my_husband_had_the chicken_saag and_was_very very_happy
sitting at the_mint
ordered different wines and they_were_out_of all of_them
my_friend_had decided_to get ras malai as_soon as_she saw it on_the_menu_and come to_find_out the didn't_have any
why list them on_the_menu if_you_don't plan_to carry or serve this_food
moreover
we_asked_for not_too spicy_food and one_of_our curry_was really_spicy
the_service_was_good
food_when not_spicy was_as_good as other_indian_restaurant in_the_area
and the_decor_is_very bland
maybe i_went_here on_their off day so gave them stars
may return to_see_if things have improved
otherwise there_are_better choices out_there for_indian_food
i_tried mint for_the_first_time today
walking_in i_was immediately bombarded with wonderful smells
we_were_greeted at the_door by_a friendly host who turned_out_to be our_server
he_was friendly
prompt
and attended to_our_table often
but_not often enough to_be annoying or pushy
we_ordered_the prefix vegetarian meal_for
spicy level
and_the andrha curry
spicy level
we were_three people but_had enough_for or
the_appetizer soup was_excellent
the naan_was_fresh
and all_the_dishes were_excellent
food
prices
reasonable
ambience environment
casual
but could_be great_for_a date or business lunch
service
fantastic
i_can't_wait_to be_back
bad customer_service here_and people are_super slow
i asked_the_waiter to_add one_more item to our_order and_he_said he doesn't know who our_table helper is_and simply left without letting us_know whether he added or_not
secondly
it_took an_hour to_get_the order
overall super bad_experience
excellent_food
i_came_to mint_indian_bistro today for_the_first_time since_i am staying in_las_vegas
we_were_seated quickly_and got_our food
the_nan came after some_time though
the_reason this_is stars and_not is_because there_wasn't much variety for_someone like_me being a_vegetarian and_not likening very spicy_food
but_overall excellent_food and_i_would recommend_the paneer_tikka_masala
that was_not extremely spicy but_still very_good
the_lunch_buffet_was excellent with_some items i've never seen at other_restaurants
also
every item_was labeled for dietary restrictions
vegetarian
gluten_free
etc
had_the
lunch_buffet_and was_impressed_with the_quality_and selection_of offerings
fresh garlic_naan_was available as_was unusual items such_as sambhar and mixed pickle
love_the dishes_that combined ginger
coconut and_garlic and_the halal offering was just_as tasty
they_have a_good_variety_of beer choices too
tamba_is a delightful indian_restaurant_in the_hawaiian_marketplace

with_a spacious dining_room and exceptionally polite staff
tamba offers a_lunch_buffet
you_can_get_a off coupon from their_website or by picking_up the_free restaurant guide near_the entrance
they claim to_be_the
only indian_restaurant on_the_strip
located_in_the hawaiian market
this_is a_hidden_gem that many may over look
at_first i_was_a_little hesitant to try_indian_food
but_what better way_to_try it than with my_indian bf and_his entourage of cousins
aunties
uncles and parents
we_came_here one saturday evening for_dinner_and i fell in_love_with the setting
it's nothing_like restaurants you_see on_the_strip
it_had_a buffet
large lounge love seats with over stuffed pillows and_an orange and gold scheme that_made you_feel_like you_were in_india itself
or so_i imagined
being with the_crowd i_was with
it_was_great because some of_them were not_too fond of extremely spicy_food so we_got a_lot_of mild dishes
you_can just tell the_staff to_make_it mild_and they_will do_so
the_vegetarian_dishes were_great
we_started off_with dishes like_the kurkari bhindi okra with brown onions_and had_chicken_tikka for_our entree
the_naan had_a_great texture for scooping up all_the sauce left_over
i_really_enjoyed_the dining_experience and_i_think that_i owe my love for_indian_food to_this_restaurant
this_is_a_great for_a first timer
we_went_in a_group_of for_their saturday lunch_buffet
the_vegetarian_dishes were pretty_good saag_paneer
paneer matar
daal
rice
etc
the non_veg weren't that_good except_for_the chicken_tikka
idlis tasted like they_were microwaved from having prepared them a_few_days ago
sambar wasn't too_bad
the_gulab jamoon was_ok
hard_to cut with_a spoon
overall
it_was_ok considering it is_one_of_the very few_indian food_options on_the_strip
i declare this_place
the_best vegetarian food_i've_had_in vegas
baby
food
they_get the spicing right
atmosphere
cool but_more in_a san_francisco than vegas way
service
attentive_and_friendly
in_vegas_for a convention
and not_really that happy_with_the bazillions of
hotel
restaurant choices
while recognizing that many of_them are exceptionally good
and wanting something vegetarian
i_looked these_guys up_and was impressed_by their_website
i_went alone
as the_rest_of my compadres were_busy at_the blackjack tables
or somewhere_else doing more
vegasy
things
and the_hostess sat me immediately
gave_me_a menu
and made_sure i_received my h
the_waiter came
discussed the_wine and beer_list and suggested a_beer the_name i forget
but_it_was great
i_ordered_the navrattan korma
and sort of expected your typical_indian navrattan korma
but was_pleasantly_surprised to receive it with_a_nice kick seriously spiced right
very_tasty
when_he first put down the_dish i_figured i'd eat about_half of_it
but_i polished it_off and would_have continued eating if_there had_been more
i've_been_to vegas a_few_times
and have_never_been all_that happy_with_the food
so_it_was a_real treat to_go somewhere this good
it_was truly the_best meal i_have_ever_had in_las_vegas
this_is_my wife's fav indian_restaurant_in_vegas
i_don't share that but_the_food_is decent here
they_do_have the_best selection_of_vegetarian stuff for_their_lunch_buffet
i_like_the atmosphere much_more here than say gandhi or india_oven too
i_am_a stickler for white_meat chicken at indian_buffets and they_didn't_have it_here surprise
surprise
i_think india_oven and gaylord buffets_are the_only_ones that have_it
indian_food_for two
walking upstairs at the_hawaiian_marketplace
you'll be surprised to_see_this dimly lit restaurant and_its ample seating_area
they_offer_a buffet lunch_and_dinner a_la_carte
it's_hard when you_want_to_try a_bunch_of different stuff when it's_just you_and the_bf
but tamba offers a_couple_of 'feasts' to_help satisfy that curiosity
for
the_bf got_the ashoka's feast which_comes with
tandoori_chicken
spring chicken in_a mildly spiced ginger yogurt_sauce
it_came_with two drumsticks and_two breasts
a_decent amount to_start his meal
there were_three dipping_sauces the_mint one
a chutney of some_sort
and_a dark purplish one
i'm_not_a particular big_fan_of tandoori
but the_bf ate three pieces_of it
lamb_curry
cubes_of lamb cooked with_onions
tomatoes
garlic
red chilies
and pickling spices
it_tasted a_bit gamey for_me
but_we did_enjoy dipping our nan_bread into_the sauce
chicken_tikka_masala
chunks_of boneless chicken roasted in_the clay_oven and_then served_in_a mild curry_sauce
the_chicken_was white_meat
and_pretty flavorless
but_the curry_sauce was_so_good
i_wish_i_had a bucket of_that to dump all_over my rice_and to smother my nan_bread with
next_time i'll tell them_to skip the_chicken_and give_me more_of that sauce
kali dal
slow cooked black lentils with_a medley of_spices
the_bf thought this_would taste just fabulous in_a burrito
as_in skip the black beans
refried beans
or pinto
and add some black lentils instead
pretty_tasty stuff and_good with_the nan_bread too
rice a_generous scoop coupled with_a_few green peas for decoration
needed to_enjoy all_the lovely sauces the_meal has_to_offer
nan
white flour tandoori bread
a_must when eating_indian_food
my preferred choice when soaking up any_kind_of curries
especially those that come_with tikka masalas
raita condiment based on yogurt used as_a sauce or dip
served chilled and_has_a cooling effect when eating spicy_dishes
i'm not_a_big_fan_of the_raita and was_only dumping it_on_the rice 'cuz the_bf was_doing it
i_can pass on_this
daily dessert two small donut like holes sitting_in a bath of butter and honey
oh_so sweet and_a_nice finish after_a hearty indian_dinner
i_ordered up_the buddha's feast for and_this_is what_i got
vegetable_samosa
crisp golden brown pastries stuffed_with mildly seasoned potatoes_and peas
the_order came_with two samosas
and_two dipping_sauces
the_bf was_pretty impressed_by these
and_i'm lucky that_i_had two to_share
malai_kofta
chunks_of cheese tossed in_a mild buttery cream_sauce
it_came_with one chunk of cheese only
which i_couldn't even tell was cheese
i_thought_it_was a mixture_of chickpeas or_something
the_sauce_was okay
and_good for_dipping
saag_paneer
spinach with_our special cottage_cheese cooked_in_a karahi with house spices
it_came_with one piece_of cottage_cheese
and i_think_it lacked flavor
the_bf said it_had_been sitting_out too_long and this_is_one_of his favorite indian_dishes
kali dal
rice
nan
raita
daily dessert
the feasts are presented quite nicely on a_large platter and_it's_a decent amount_of_food
you definitely get the_chance_to taste a_few_different things without breaking the budget or ordering too_much_food
the_bf also_ordered a_mango_lassi that_he found a_bit_too sweet for_his liking
i_thought_it tasted fine
but was_more watery than_what i'm_used_to
service_was_good our water_glasses_were filled without asking
the_only complaint_was that_our main_courses came out too quickly after_our appetizers
we_had_to help the_waiter move some_dishes around while_we_were still eating and_he_was juggling the_huge platters
there's_also a back room available_for private parties with_a more family_style seating
sidenote
you_can_get_a off coupon entree at_the tix less booth downstairs
or a_coupon from their_website
check_out_the pics of_our eating in_the business profile
i echo some_of_the_other reviewers by saying_that this_is_my_favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
i_don't usually like to_go_to_the strip to_eat
unless it's a_special occasion
but tamba_is worth_it
it_is_very upscale in decor
yet has_good ethnic flavor to_it as_well
waiters_are attentive
but not_overly so
which i_hate
the_buffet choices are excellent and_all food_is_fresh_and warm_and tasty
the_only drawback
it_is closed for a_couple_of hours before dinner_time
i belive
pm or_so
i_like my_dinner early sometimes
and_it_was_a bid of_a disappintement
overall
recommended
very clean_place
i_ate_here once for valentine's day dinner
the image i gleaned from their_website made_it appear to_be all plush pillows
flickering candles
and meditating statuettes
the internet can_be so deceiving
first of_all
the chic dining_area they prominently display on their_website
which_is
and_i quote
designed as_a hipster hangout and features plush seating beneath the striking murals of international artist farhad elahi
is_their reserved banquet dining_room
tucked far away in_the backend of_the_restaurant
regular parties eat_in a_much less interesting_and unromantic dining space
complete with standard tables_and chairs
i_suppose the general vim of this_spot is acceptable for_lunch or_a casual dinner
but_it_was v day_and i_wanted_to sit on_a sexy red pillow damnit
exacerbating the_ambiance situation was the_food situation
being adventurous not_to_mention gluttonous we pretty much ordered_one of_everything
the mulagatani soup_was an unremarkably flavorless bowl_of pepper and_water
while the_other pakistani style dishes_were just_as boring and lacking_in flavor_and heat
the_service sucked
especially considering it_was v day
this_place_is in sync with the_line of reasoning adopted by_its sister restaurants_around the_valley
gandhi's and gaylord's
in_that hiking up_your prices_and offering_a wine_list somehow makes_you less of_a mediocre north_indian pakistani spot and more_of_a
and_i quote
hipster hangout
next please
given that_we_were hella drunk and hella hungry
but the_food_was_awesome
we_got appetizers_and each of_them were_good
dont remembr what_we_got though
for_dinner
we_got bhindi
totally awesome
daal_was great
malai_kofta was_good_but a very_small helping and_we_got some chicken
the_food_was served_in exactly minutes_after we_ordered
the_good is it_was before time
the_bad is
it_was_all prepared in_advance
the rotis and_the paranthas were_very_good
we_had kheer and gajar ka halwa
i_highly_recommend_this_place on_the_strip
food_was heavy so_we walked to_our condo at_the signature next_to mgm
nothing_special
decent seating
good_service
nothing extraordinary about_the_food
it_tasted_like any average_indian place
but i_don't_have high expectations from an_indian_place in_las_vegas
would i_go_there again
yes
for_an pm reservation on_a_saturday_night
i_didn't_have a_problem getting in
when_we_got to_the_restaurant
it_was relatively empty
when_we_left
there_were many more_people
the_website is kinda deceiving
they show the_nice lounge area
which_is not where_they seat you for_dinner
the lounge area was_nice
but_it_wasn't open at_all when_i_was there
and_i left at pm
the_food_was_pretty_good
i_couldn't believe_that the_entrees didn't_come with_naan or_anything
everything
dal
naan
etc
had_to_be ordered a_la_carte
for an_extra charge
we_ordered_the naan_and roti which only came_with four pieces each
maybe i'm_just used_to going_to places where the_naan_is free and_you_get it by_the basket load
i_would_definitely_go back again if_i wanted indian_food while in_vegas
the_service_was_excellent too
very_attentive_and quick
the_best_indian_food_i've tried so_far
and_i've tried a_lot
in many_different places all_over_the world
they_use a tandoor oven
so_you_can find_some healthy dishes_that taste really_great
their vegetable_dishes are incredible as_well
i_love_their buffet too
because you_can_try all_the different_dishes and figure out what_it_is that_you like
everything_is labeled so_you_know what_you are getting
the_atmosphere_is_nice
and the_service_is_great
oh
their food_is_so_good
i_think_i will_go there now
we_had_a fairly late dinner_there and suprisingly found very authentic_indian_food you_can really taste the_difference in the_spices
friendly
efficient service
i vow to_try_the_buffet next_time we_are back in_vegas
tamba was_my_first indian_food experience
i went_here_for_the the_first_time a_few_months back for_dinner
and_i_would really_like to_go_back again
it's kind of hidden all_the_way in_the_back of the_hawaiian_marketplace
but_the_food_is really_good
i_tried_the murg biryani
which_was_a very flavorable chicken rice dish with_nuts and raisins
my_favorite part would_have to_be_the raisins
it gave_the dish a_very surprising sweetness to_it
i_also_had a sample of_my friends' chicken_korma curry and_tandoori_chicken
which were_both good_as_well
i would_love to_go_back_and_try more different_dishes
go_for_the food
not the_ambiance
we_were in_vegas_for my sister's wedding
indian
my extended family pretty much ate_here everynight except one
the reception
the buffet_is_great for_vegetarians
they keep_it fresh_and warm
the_food_is_excellent and_lots_of choices
the_meat stuff was_good_too
but_i_was too fully from everything else
the_service_was fair
our nephew has_some food allergies and_they_were not_overly accomadating in tyring to prepare something outside the_buffet
there seems to_be_a caravan of_indian tourist buses that roll thru the_area in_the evenings
so be_prepared for it_to_be busy
would i_go_back
yes
on_the_strip
this_place_is_a gift from guru nanak
if picked up_and dropped anywhere else in the_world
it's pretty_good
north_indian type food_here_is nothing inspiring
but satisfying
we_had the_buffet_and my vegetarian man was_happy
i_was_happy with_the_food decent naan
mint_chutney
tandoori_chicken the_usual stuff i_get
the_best_part was_being off_the_strip and away_from_the
hey bro
douchebags
it was_clean_and quiet
this is_hard_to find on_the_strip and_a i relished the calm
grabbed a_buffet dinner
the spread was_great
lots_of vegetarian_options
desert was_probably_the weakest
but very_good_food overall
ate_the
lunch_time buffet on_a monday and_it_was_very disappointing
the_food_was oily and_seemed to_be sitting_out for_a_long_time
oddly
the_place seemed busy
which made_me think one_of two_things
a
being the_only indian_restaurant on_the_strip
tamba's owners clearly aren't worried about quality
b
tamba's dinner_menu must_be amazing to compensate
customer_service_is worst
the_night buffet_is worst
the_food doesn't look fresh
recommend not to_go_there
specially in_the night
when_i moved_to vegas from australia i worried that decent_indian_food was_going_to_be a thing of the_past
few americans i spoke to dreamed of_eating a_curry
and_it's tough to find_in supermarkets
but_i need not_have worried
vegas has_a_great array_of indian_food available of varying quality
i_have_tried it_all and the_one place_the wife_and_i keep coming_back_to is tamba
oddly situated at the_back_of_the abandoned hulk that_is the_hawaiian_marketplace foodcourt
tamba_is in_my_opinion the_best_food to_be had anywhere on_the_strip
everything_is spiced to_perfection and_there's a_great array both for meat_eaters and vegetarians
the_lunch_buffet_is sensational value
confused at_the people here saying the_service_is bad rude
i_can barely take_a sip of my_water before a polite
to_the_point of humble
waiter is rushing to_top me_up
tamba offers a_lunch_buffet on_the_weekends that_is quite satisfying
plenty of_choice
including salad y stuff
entrees
desserts
and plenty to_satisfy either vegetarians or meat_eaters in_your party
it_was_all very_good
especially the_vegetable_curry i_tried
the_staff_is helpful
the_dining_room is_nice
the_only_thing_that would_have improved the_experience for_me would_be
being hungrier and
labels on_the_buffet choices
the_staff_were happy_to answer our questions about any_of_the food
however
is_a perennial complaint i_have with indian_buffets
i like_indian_food immensely and would_like_to learn more about_it so_i_can remember_what i_especially like
but all_of_the indian_places_i frequent are label less
so except_for stuff that's easy_to identify like curry
i_am left describing things as
that green goopy thing
and
that orange goopy thing
and
that_other thing with the_lamb
whenever_i have out_of_town friends
i bring them to_tamba
i_love_the furniture and_the_food
there_are_so many vegetarian_dishes to_choose_from
pretty reasonable too in price
very_friendly
spacious and tucked_away
wish_they had parking nearby
aside from_the feeling that you_are entering a deserted mini mall when you_go to_tamba
this_place_is pretty_good
i_am_in_vegas quite_a_bit for work and_my coworkers and_i_are always searching_for dinner options that don't require you_to win big before you_can_eat
thanks_to open table
we_found_this hidden little_gem
the_feeling of_the_restaurant is_pretty generic
the_website gives the impression that you_will_be walking_into a luxurious setting complete with red velvet cushions and dramatic draperies
um
not_so_much
but_we clearly weren't looking_for trendy so_no big_deal
we_had booked a_party_of
which ended up being a_party_of four
the_host was_nice about_it
but
unfortunately the_restaurant doesn't_have too_many options_for tops so we_ended_up sitting at_a table_for six
i_guess they_get a_lot_of large groups
i_started with_a manhattan
when it_came_out a dark red
i_was_a_little concerned that it_wasn't made correctly
but_after tasting
it was_just_right
i_had_the butter_chicken
which_was rich_and delicious
but_not_too heavy
my_friends didn't_really know what_they wanted so the_server just brought_out_a few different_dishes to_share
one_of_my friends had_a spicy_chicken dish_that_was fantastic
in hindsight
i_wish we_would_have asked_what they_were
all in_all
it_was_a_great meal
friendly_service
and we_were_all able_to_get out_of there_for around per_person
woo hoo
one_of_the places where_you can_get jain food
the_waiter even wrote jain in_front_of_the items
so_i suppose they might be getting a_lot_of jain customers
we_ordered_the following jain items this_time
malai paneer
yellow daal
mutter_paneer
the_last_time
around years_ago
they_also made jain malai_kofta
during_dinner
i_have_been_to this_place around times_and its always_a saviour
this time_around they_were_very busy so the_service sucked
its_not like_this always
but yes sometimes we take the_buffet
so not_much service_is required anyways
we could_see several people waiting to_be_seated and_they_were also getting a_little_bit frustrated
would_definitely_recommend_this_place for_good jain food
shockingly good
i_am most grateful to my_fellow yelpers for drawing our attention_to this establishment
we_never would_have ventured into the_hawaiian_marketplace for_food never
after_reading_the reviews_and finding a_coupon in_the vegas booklet
we_went
it_was exactly as stated
totally deserted
we wondered whether it_was open when_we_arrived at_about
by_the_time_we left
it filled to overflowing with mostly indian clientele
which_is telling
i_think_the dinner_buffet began around_pm
my_husband_and_i are_big fans of_indian
but we_always find_it hard_to get really_good_and not_just mediocre indian_cuisine
there's lots_of mediocrity out_there in_terms of_indian
tamba was_really really_tasty
we_tried two new_dishes which we_enjoyed
the_first was panipuri
an_indian street_food
which involves a hollow shell made of_indian crispy bread which_you fill with_a green spicy_sauce which_is supplied separately
thanks_to our_server who told_us how to_eat_it
it's fun
like a_shot of mild spice
the_other dish we_had_was the_dessert which_came_with the ashoka's feast
it_was made_of dried carrot and nuts
now
i_have this weird thing against cooked carrots
they make_me gag
but i_love raw carrot
it's strange
so anyhow
i_was_not aware_of what this_dish
gajar halva
was_made out_of
i asked_the_waiter
it_tasted nothing_like carrot
it_has this amazing texture_and sweetness
i_highly_recommend it
like_most extra american dishes
i find_that you_should eat_it without knowing what_it_is
i_think many americans have preconceived notions of_what things should taste_like and_their texture so knowing what you're eating is_more apt to gross you out than allow you to_experience it
oh yea
while the_food_was_excellent here and_the_service
the ashoka's feast is not_really enough_food for_two_people
we_ordered_the pani puri as_an_appetizer with_this in_mind and even_though_i wasn't starving
it_was barely enough_food
it_was_all very_tasty
but_i wish we_had_ordered a_bit_more food
especially now as_i write this_really wishing i_was_in vegas eating some tamba
i_also did_not find tamba to_be generic in_any way
it_was decorated nicely and_was lit well
somewhat romantically
and quiet
yes
very_very_good
i'd_recommend the_lunch_buffet_for value_for_money
same_as the_evening grub
for of the_price
great_service_and vibe
they_do_a fine job here
most_of_their vegetarian items beat the_hell out_of other indian_buffet vegetarian items
sadly
their meat items do_not beat the_hell out_of other indian_buffet meat items
good_price
nice service
nice_ambience
i_like_it
good_and unique flavors
decent prices
the_saag_paneer was_decent but rice had_to_be ordered separately
the_naan was_good_and_the ashokas feast was a_good_variety_of flavors
surprising for the_strip
a_nice_change of pace
would return if invited
oh yelpers
how you_have failed me
my_boyfriend_and_i found tamba's advertisement in one_of vegas's books during our_visit
and decided_to_go here_for_dinner after_reading_the
good_reviews
and ratings on_yelp
after finally having eaten there
i_would_give this_place half a_star if_i_could
for_its bad_food and terrible_service
i_live in silicon valley a mecca of_indian_restaurants and cafes and eat_indian_food at_least_once_a_week
it's my latest addiction
i_know good_curry when_i taste it
and_let me_tell you now before_you waste_your time_and money
you_will_not find good_curry here
we_went_for_the
dinner_buffet
which
it turns out
was reserved for private parties only
so we_ended_up ordering the_butter_chicken_and a_lamb curry_with some_naan off of_the_menu
but the_waiter_brought out what_he called
chicken_tikka_masala
and_when_we told him it_wasn't what we_ordered
he_then said_he misspoke and it_was_actually
butter_chicken
after_all
either way
it_tasted_like water
no_flavor whatsoever
the_lamb_curry on_the_other_hand
was_a spoonful of salt with every_bite
yuck
i've never abandoned an_indian meal in_my_life
no matter how mediocre
but i_could_not get myself past even half this meal
maybe_the bland curry juxtaposed to_the salty one made_it seem even saltier
or
maybe
i_thought
if_i mix the_two curries together
i_would find_a happy medium
how wrong i_was
there_was no happiness to be_found there
to_top_it off
when_our bill_came
we_were charged for_the
chicken_tikka_masala
instead_of butter_chicken
and_told our_server about_the mistake
he said
it_doesn't matter anyway
they're the_same_price
indeed not
i corrected him and_said that_the butter_chicken_is
so_he responded
fine
i'll just comp you the_difference
comp
comp
are_you kidding me
you're_not comping us anything
we're just asking you_to charge us for_what_we actually ordered
don't think you're doing us any favors
finally
just to_add insult to injury
they advertised off the_bill if you showed them_the ad from_the vegas booklet
but_when we_gave him the
coupon
instead_of taking off
he added_to our bill for gratuity
ha
unbelievable
i_guess
in_vegas
you_don't_have to_go_to_the casinos to lose your money
i_came_here_with my coworkers after_a_long boring sunday at work
eating_here was_definitely the_highlight_of my day
we_ordered
chicken_tikka
delicious cubes_of flavorful chicken served_with sides of mint as_well as tamarind sauces
tandoori_chicken
delicious preperation
i_only wish_the cuts of_chicken were meatier
chicken_tikka_masala
my_favorite_dish
full_of_flavor and_soft tender_chicken pieces
the_sauce base is_perfect for_dipping your naan into
chicken_vindaloo
the_spice_level was_perfect
it_was_spicy enough_for those who_are adventurous
but_it_wasn't so_spicy that_is took away_from_the wonderful flavor
yellow fried_rice
great_flavor
perfect accompaniment to the_tandoori_chicken
naan
plain butter and_garlic
both were_excellent
flaky with_a soft fluffy center
drinks
bombay
sapporo beer
strawberry daiquiri
the_service_was fantastic both from the_waiter and_the bussers
the_ambiance was_excellent_and the_decor_and dishes they_used_to serve the_food were_very modern
i_would_not hesitate to_take_a date here
food_and_service were_excellent
i_went with_a_group_of people_and everyone's order_was correct
prompt_and served_at the_same_time
drinks_were refilled immediately
the_food_was flavorful_and as described on_the_menu
i_would_give it_stars
with the_exception that_i_didn't have_to_pay the_bill
so_i_can't really comment on_the costs and_or the_value aspect of_this_place
i_love the_lunch_buffet at_this_place
the_food_is_great
the_chicken_makhani is_just awesome
everytime_i eat_here
i_get up to_get food from_the_buffet around times or_so
the_place_looks nice also
can't_wait_to go_back next_time i'm_in_vegas
went to_tamba while visiting_vegas
honestly
we_found_this_place because we_had_a coupon from_the entertainment book
we ended_up_going twice
our_first dinner_there was_on sunday_night we fell in_love_with the_place
the waiters_were friendly_and_helpful
we_were given a_second dessert for_free because we_were_told we_had_to try_that one too
we_were so_happy that we_did
my_first_visit to_tamba food
service
perks gets stars
we_went_back to_tamba a_few_days later with_a_friend
the_food_was still_good
but seemed saltier than sunday
we_had_ordered different_dishes so not_sure if_the saltiness was_just due_to our_order
we_still enjoyed_the_food and the_service_was_good
but a_little_off on_the timing
barely touched appetizer before main course came out
one_of_the servers seemed annoyed by_the use_of the_coupon
but_otherwise
it_was_still good
second_visit
stars
i disagree with_any bad comments on this_place
maybe the_buffet isn't_the greatest but in_general buffets_are never that_good
all_the_food just sits around
on_that note
me and_my_boyfriend went and_ate here_about a_week ago bc a_friend i_had_in my summer class at unlv worked here
although he wasn't there that_night we_went anyways and_everyone was_so_nice
the_service_was_excellent and the_food_was_fantastic
i completely disagree with the_yelp from sang whatever bc we_ordered_the chicken_tikka_masala_and it_was_awesome
we also_got the_lamb_vindaloo_and the_combo together was phenomenal
the_chicken_tikka_was so buttery and_had_a great_flavor while the_lamb_vindaloo had the_perfect amount_of_heat
we_had samosas of_course and_they_were pretty_good
from_my memory i've_had better but everything_else_was delicious
our_water was_never empty and_everyone was_so_nice
we_also_had some dessert
a round cake like ball thing
dont know what its called
and_some carrots
very good_as_well
the_location_is a_little strange
i_thought_it_was closed when_we_were going_there
but_they_were open
the_atmosphere_was great
the_service_was_great
and the_food_was_awesome
the_rest_of_the night me and_my_boyfriend kept saying how nice of_a dinner that_was and_have_been craving_indian_food ever_since
a
hands_down_the worst indian_buffet i've ever_been_to
and_to the_people who say_that you_can't expect much from buffet_food
you_just haven't been_to a_good_indian buffet
i admit there_are_some things i've come_to expect_from an_indian_buffet
like_that the_naan should probably_be freshly brought out to_the_table
rather than wasting away en masse under_a hot light
the core of_the_meal
the proteins
should also not_be mystery meat bobbing in_a thin gruel of oil and colored sauce
the_most edible thing was_probably_the goat_curry
and only_because i_love me_some lamb goat
there_were little signs to_help you navigate the_curries
as_we discovered later
but_they misidentified stuff and_were hard_to read
the_place_looks nicer than it_tastes
fo sho
pathetic
i read_the_reviews of_this_place before coming and found_it interesting that_there_was such_a spread of opinions
my_experience with yelp_reviews has_been that_they tend_to clump together around a mutually agreed upon rating but_this_one had people who loved_it and people who hated it
my_fellow diner and_i agreed that
stars_is just_about the correct rating though
impressions
the_place_is nicely_decorated with low light_and soft music
it_is upstairs in_a a grim looking food_court in_the_back of_a low rent outdoor shopping_center
it_has_a nice_ambiance once inside though
we went_for_the_lunch_buffet
pros
very_friendly_and_attentive staff
my_water_glass never reached the_half way empty mark
plenty_of_vegetarian selections in_the_buffet
the_chicken_tikka_masala_and a_paneer curry
i missed the_name
were_both very_good
cons
the daal_was overly salty
some dishes_were just_okay and_not spectacular
overall we had_a_nice lunch_here but_i've had_better_indian buffets in_the_bay_area
in_the midst of_a sea of burgers and undercooked pizza slices however this_is_a welcomed change
indian_food is_by_far my_favorite
and i_was_so pleased to_run into tamba on_the_strip
we_came during_lunch and were_able_to eat off_of the_buffet_and get unlimited non alcoholic drinks for
being vegetarians
we_were totally stoked that_they_had at least different_dishes in_addition_to rice
naan
and those weird soda break things
i learned that i_love dal makni
malai paneer
and punjabi curry
which would_be things i_would normally not get_to_try because_i always_order my_favorite
muttar paneer
anyway
the_service_was really_great
the_location was_awesome
and the_food_was_so incredibly tasty
five_stars alllll the_way
i_had_the_lunch special
and_it included some very traditional indian_fare that most americans would_not ascribe to_indian_food
the_buffet_was vegetarian heavy
which_i loved as_i favor the southern style
waitstaff was_friendly
the_decor_was pleasantly better_than expected
considering this was_not_a strip hotel restaurant
i_guess_i would describe the_food as not particularly gourmet
but utterly satisfying
not_bad for_a semi vacant strip_mall
if_i ever go_back_to vegas
i_will have_to_try dinner a a_la_carte
i_have_never tried_the sit down dinner_menu
but_i_am a_huge_fan_of the all_you_can_eat lunch_buffet_for
great environment and very_clean
yum_yum for tamba
one_of_the best restaurants_i've ever_been_to
exceptional service
we_eat fine restaurants all_the_time in san_francisco and_this beats all
my best experience in_vegas
everytime_i have visited_this restaurant
or its sister restaurant
gandhi
the food_has_been consistently good
the_price_is reasonable
for_a_buffet and_i always enjoy my_meal
the mango_lassis are great_as_well
but_the_service could always be improved
the_location_is a pain
considering_that you_have_to enter through_a sm
side street on_the_strip and getting out_of there will_be_a nightmare
i_always exit from_the back side and_you_will need_to know_that trick to_avoid all_that traffic from las_vegas strip
if_you_are_in town
it's_worth_the visit_to either of_the_two restaurants
i_have_been eating_at gandhi for_over yrs
now
since tamba_is a_little_more recent
food_is still_good
the_only_downside of tamba_is trying_to locate it_in the_back_of_the run down hawaiian_marketplace
the_food_is_outstanding
the buffet_lunch is_great at
per_person and features a_very_good malai paneer
the_staff_is_friendly_and attentive
as_an added bonus
the_interior_is very classy
my_family recently visited us_from london and_we_all went_to_this excellent place
upon our arrival we_were_greeted nicely and_then they seated_us in_this exclusive area because_they thought we_were_the people taking a tour
it_was hilarious when they_came and_told_us how they_had made_a mistake and apologized extensively for there inconvenience
i_think everything_is fine with this_restaurant but_i_would prefer ordering over their_buffet
the bathrooms need_to_be more clean
besides that the_place_is nice_and chic
there_is this huge market below this where_you can_get cheap stuff from sunglasses to shawls and_other materials
the_food_was_very tasty
a_touch on_the spicy side
but that_can_be expected with_indian_food unless_you ask_for it_to_be mild
the setting was beautiful
calm and_relaxing
most_of_the staff was_wonderful
our_main waiter paid no attention to_our_table at_all
but the_other staff made_up_for_it
if_you_want_a great beer
try_the taj_mahal
the_people here_are running more a business than_a place_for some_indian_food
i observed the_owner manager to_be_very business minded be cared to the_customers with such perspective
thats different story
who cares if_the_food end_up delicious
which_isn't the_case
less than_average taste
not all_the items_in menu are available
the_only advantage its at the_strip
else i_liked_the food http

far better_than in tamba during_my day visit_to vegas
weekend lunch_buffet review
our plan was_to find_some grub at aria but_we either found stuff that_was too_expensive or_not very appealing
by_this time_we_were starving so_i whip out_my trusty iphone and used my yelp app to_find this_place_just across_the_street
it's_located in the_hawaiian_marketplace all_the_way in_the_back
the_first_thing we_did after_we entered was pay the for the_weekend lunch_buffet
i_thought_that was_a_bit strange but_if the_hotel buffet places can do_it why_not
they had_a_lot_of variety
at least different_items
and_thought everything was_just_ok
one_thing_i thought was_really_good was_their upma
it's like_an_indian version_of the moroccan cous cous
it was_my_first_time having the_dish and_it_was simple yet very_tasty
the_chicken_tandoori had good_flavor but was_a_little dry
the_chicken_tikka_masala sauce was_good_but there_wasn't a_lot_of chicken
i_had_to dig around_for some
what_i noticed is that_this_place supplied small containers for_the different_dishes
i've never seen that before and_thought it's_a_good idea for_those who don't_like mixing their_food
they_were pretty_good with refilling our_water cups and clearing our dirty plates
bad_thing with_this buffet_was drinks weren't included so a_separate bill_was handed to_us
another downside was the_food_wasn't labeled properly
so_i_was just grabbing things blindly
overall it_was_just an ok experience
at least tamba introduced me_to a_new dish
now all i_have_to do is find_it here_in la
the_lunch_buffet was_very_good with many_options
there were_three or four meat items_and six or seven veggie items
the naan_was_excellent and_all_the items seemed fresh_and were very_hot
there_were many indians eating_here
which is_always_good
they_could lose the_plastic water cups though
that seems a_little silly
when i_am_in_vegas
very rarely do_i wake up_in time to_have lunch
i_have_been_to tamba times before and_always for_dinner pre dinner
there food_has always_been good
but_the_service with attitude has_always turned me_off
i_would_not waste my time typing this if it_was_not for_their value_for_money lunch_buffet i_had last time
it_comes_to per_person and_it_has lots_of variety
none_of_the items_are truly great
but none are bad too
now only if they_would serve you water in something other_than those cheap iparty plastic cups
we_enjoyed_the buffet_and_it_was reasonably price_of
i_would_recommend visiting here
first of_all
moderators
can_you correct the_name_of the_restaurant
it's_really tamba indian_cuisine lounge
i see_that the_right url is provided
so let's make_it easier for other_people to_find_this indian gem
since this_was_my_first_time out as_a las_vegas resident
i_was extremely pleased_to discover that las_vegas does indeed have stellar indian_cuisine
i_read the_first review carefully and already knew it_was considered excellent by indian natives
but_when_i arrived_and saw_that virtually everyone_in the_restaurant_was indian
i_knew it was_going_to_be superb and_it_was
my perennial favorite
lamb_vindaloo
was_as spicy_as it_should_be
the_lamb_was_tender
although i've tasted superior lamb
namely in paris
as a_starter i_ordered onion kulcha
the_waiter_brought out the_nan accompanied by a_plate_of tomatoes
onions
jalapenos and pickled vegetables
i_knew then and there_that i_would_be in_for_a treat
the_rice_was excellent although_i prefer mine laced with_peas and_authentic cardamom seeds
but for_most food lovers this_is_probably adventurous enough
in_all
a_great_find in_las_vegas
don't_let_the hawaiian_marketplace surroundings fool_you
this_is truly outstanding indian_food_and las_vegas deserves it
mighty tasty
service_was_excellent
highly_recommended if seeking well prepared indian_cuisine
great recommendation from caesar's palace conceirge
this_really is_the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
i_was trying to_find_a nice_place to_take my_girlfriend for_her birthday dinner
first
we_were looking_for_a greek place
but_didn't find any with decent reviews
so since we_have_had good luck with_indian_food in_the_past
i_figured i'd scour yelp for suggestions
i_found tamba to_be in the_top five on_yelp_and found every place_in_the list to_have mixed reviews
after looking_at_the web sites of the_top five
their menus and plenty of thought
i_finally decided_on tamba
i_used opentable
com to_make our reservation for pm saturday_night
since this_place_is in the_hawaiian_marketplace on_the_strip
i_figured it_would_be packed
in_fact
one_of_the reviews said to_make_sure you_get_a reservation or your wait could exceed two hours
when_we_arrived
the place_was_pretty empty
i_believe there were_only four or five tables taken at_that point
so_we_were greeted_by_the manager and_he wished my_girlfriend a happy birthday
nice_touch
i_am actually glad the_place_was empty because the_waiter spent a_lot_of time talking over the_menu options_and giving us recommendations
during_our conversation with the_waiter
we talked about_the lamb_dishes and he_could tell we_were hesitant
so he_brought over sample for_us_to try
it_was_so_good
i_chose the roghan gosht as_my main_dish
my_girlfriend chose the_butter_chicken_and we_started_with_the sea bass appetizer
on_the spice scale
i'd say the_lamb_was a out_of and_the_butter_chicken was_a
the_wine selection was_average
but my_girlfriend really_enjoyed_the fruity martini
the_price_was better than_i_expected for_dinner on_the_strip in_las_vegas
we_both_had two drinks
an_appetizer
two main_dishes
rice
garlic_nan and_two desert items and_got out_of there_for around_and that included the tip
two more signs that tamba serves good_indian_food
by_the_time_we left
ish
the_place_was_packed and_there_were a_lot_of actual indian_people dinning there
we_both said_that we would_go_back
great_food
we tried_their vegetarian_dishes_and food_was_really awesome
would_love to_go_there when i_am_in_vegas next_time
we_were_in vegas recently and we_were_told by a_couple_of different people to_try_this indian_buffet
supposedly the_only indian_buffet on_the_strip
it_was well_worth going_to
nice_selection and_everything we_tried was_good
with tax it's per_person
a_little secret hidden_in the_hawaiian_marketplace
tamba was_a surprising find and_the_quality was_outstanding
i_was with a_party_of and_we_all got something different_and spent the_evening swapping tastes of_each others dishes
i myself had
palak_paneer
and
yellow rice
the_paneer was_excellent_and generous portions_of tofu
the_rice_was nearly perfect but_just a_tad undercooked dry but worked well_as_a mix with the_paneer wrapped up_in fresh nan
the_dishes and_the_restaurant are_well presented with authentic palettes and_decor
the_music_was subtle an unobtrusive and_the_waiter was_superb
while this_restaurant_is in_vegas
the_prices_were a_little_high than i'd normally expect but are a_pretty_good deal considering the_location
good deals can_be had if you check the normal coupon books
there_are specific ones for tamba that could_have saved us a_bit
with_all that_said
while the_food_was_excellent
the_staff_was superb
and the_atmosphere_was inviting
the restrooms were atrocious
i_was_pretty shocked considering_the dining_experience to_find_the bathrooms somewhat trashed and unkept which worried me a_little
overall_i still give tamba
but please folks
take_care of_those frightening bathrooms and you'd easily be_a
loved_the_food and_the_service so_much_that we_ate here twice during_our brief stay_in vegas
it's a_bit_pricey
so be_sure_to look through your resort magazine for_the off coupon
was_excited_to_try this_indian_restaurant since_it_was recommended_by some_indian acquaintances
i_love_indian_food
i generally don't_go to_the_buffet lunches as they_usually don't offer the_best selection
everything chicken
and_quality but my_friend said
the_buffet_is actually good_and they_even offer lamb_curry korma
you_just have_to_ask for_it and_the_waiter will bring_it to_your_table
the_flavors_of all the_curries_were fantastic_and deserving of stars
the_only_problem is every curry was_way too_salty
not_sure if this_was intended being that_it_was_a buffet_and perhaps they want you to_fill_up on rice_or nan
had they cut the salt in half
they_would_have gotten stars from_me
apparently they must_be doing something right because out_of_the whole food_court in hawaiian village
they were_the_only restaurant left standing
i_would potentially go_back again but_only if_i needed some extra sodium in_my diet
bad_food
flavorless indian_food and_i_have almost always had_better
i_think survives because_of_the tourist crowd in_vegas
i went_for_the_lunch_buffet and_i_found that_the pakoras_were without spice and_a_little soggy
sambar was_lacking salt and_tamarind
chicken_was overcooked_and the_bread_was rubber like
at
that_is indeed a waste
pre pay indian_buffet
ok
i_was_a_little taken back by_this
but glad_i gave them the_chance anyway
this_buffet had_the largest selection_of several that i_tried in_vegas
including a_couple southern_indian items
iddli and sambar
my_water was_never less than_half filled
as_if the server's sole mission in life was to_keep my glass full
food_was authentic
flavorful
and spicy_for a_change
i_really_liked tambar
every_time_we good back for_our annual vacation in_lv
a trip_to tamba_is planned
we_always do the_lunch_buffet the_price_is good_and the_buffet_is plentiful
we love_indian_food we_are not_indian so_we know what_we like
tamba has_a_great selection_of_vegetarian food_with minimal meat items we_are carnivores but are_just as happy_with meatless dishes there
each time_we have_gone
we have_found several items_on_the lunch_buffet_that we_have never tasted before so_we know_that they change up_the buffet_items regularly
their_tandoori_chicken is the_best_i_have_had it_is_always moist_and tasty
not dried out or overcooked
they_always have_a paneer dish there
a soup
lots_of veggie_dishes like aloo_gobi
etc
they_always have_a dessert on_the_buffet and loads_of hot_naan
i_would_recommend_this_place to_anyone_who enjoys indian_food_or is_just learning their_buffet_is a_great_way_to jump in
second time to_tamba
it's friggin' awesome
sarah and_i first stumbled upon this charmer on_our vegas trip after falling out_of_the luxor and walking a hangover off
deep inside the_hawaiian_marketplace where even_the kfc failed and shuttered it's doors lies tamba
the lone restaurant_in what at_one time was_a glorious food_court
up_the escalator and inside
you_get_a whiff of_the_buffet and hear the soft_and trendy music
the_perfect sound track for_the inevitable food_coma that_the awesome buffet_is about to_give
loved_this_place so_much the_first_time_we skipped the_indian spot across from_our hotel and drove straight to_tamba
tamba in
tamba in too i'm_sure
take_out food_is alright
buffet is_decent as_well
this_review_is solely for_the_lunch_buffet
tamba offers perhaps_the best_indian_lunch_buffet in_town
unlike most indian_restaurants_in_vegas
the cooks at tamba don't focus on_a bland tourist palate
and_as_a result
they_don't produce spice less offerings
what the_buffet does offer is an_amazing array_of vegetarian_options tasty
spicy and_delicious options chana_masala
chick_pea masala
palak_paneer and various other vegetable based deliciousness
but the_buffet isn't solely for the_vegetable lover
the tamba buffet also carries several chicken_dishes in well crafted sauces
if you've eaten_at a_few vegas indian_buffets
you'll know_that tasty_and spicy foods are rare
so_if you're near the_south side of_the_strip for_lunch
you_can't do much better
as_for_the dinner or regular dishes
not_in buffet form
i_haven't_tried them
but several india born friends have told_me that tamba is_the_best_indian_restaurant in_town
rounded up_to
my_friend_and_i were_really lucky to_find_this restaurant
since_it_was hidden_in a deserted mall plaza
but to_the_point it_was_delicious
we_decided_to share
ashoka's feast
which consisted_of a variety_of_dishes because it_was_a_good deal
comes with_rice
naan
dessert
multiple meat_dishes
etc
it_was_almost true
but the_portions_were a_tad too small for_two_people
we_had_to order extra naan in_the_end and used it to_dip the_leftovers with
everything was_pretty_good
but i_just_wish the_food_was bit_more spicier
the_servers_were really friendly_and_helpful
too
i_think_this place really is_the_only indian_restaurant on_the_strip
well
that's_what they claim on their_website
overall
not_bad
price comes_out to around person
personally
i_think i've_had better
but_i_guess i'm not_too picky_about my_indian_food because_they always taste so_flavorful to_me
i_think if_i_were to come_back_here
i'd_come for_the_lunch_buffet
though
being one_of_the only indian_restaurants on the_las_vegas strip
you_would think_that they_would really take advantage_of the situation and show the_world how great_indian_food can_be
instead
this restaurant_is_located inside a mostly vacant building
and_the_food they_serve is very_bland
the_good
great_selection_of vegetarian_dishes
the_sambar was_the_best item on_the_buffet
atmosphere in_the_restaurant was_good
the_bad
food_was_very bland
except_for a_couple_of items_that were_good
there were_only meat_dishes and they_were_all chicken
service_was_ok
no_one ever came_by to_take my_drink order
fairly expensive for_a_lunch_buffet
a_person without a_drink
this_place_was okay
but_there_are better_places to go_for_dinner than here
but_if_you_are craving_indian_food
then this_is basically the_only choice you_have along the_strip
for vegas this_is_definitely awesome
i_went_here for_dinner and_was_very pleasantly_surprised with_the dishes
i_have_eaten a_lot_of really_good indian_food_and_this wasn't going down as the_best
but come_on
it's vegas
if this_was_a restaurant in_nyc it would_get about stars
but in_vegas it_gets
the_naan_was ok
same goes for the_raita
the_dishes though were_very_tasty and_spicy
the_location_is really odd
it's in_the_back of_a crappy food_court
but_it_is really nice_inside
the_prices_were awesome for vegas
and_i'll definitely frequent it_when i_visit
i_think where_the rating is right_now at is_probably right
i_also agree with_a_lot_of other yelpers about getting the_best_indian_buffet for_your money
first
i_dont expect to_be amazed by a_buffet
and second
i_definitely dont expect to_be amazed by_a buffet_that is_so cheap
compared_to other buffets on_the_strip
you_get a_good_variety_of indian_food
mostly vegetarian
and_its around
what_is the funniest thing about_this_place_is where_it is_located
it_is inside a
what seems_to be_an abandoned food_court type building
and is_the_only that has_been running ever_since i_first came_here years_ago
seriously
i_have_never seen any_other store in_this food_court open
i_think if you dont mind eating a_little unhealthy indian_food_that tastes decent you_should check_this_place out
i_have_had their fresh_food here_once
and honestly this_is_one place_where their fresh_food tastes slightly better_than their_buffet
usually
the restaurant's fresh_food tastes way better_than their_buffet
but_i_guess their food_quality doesnt change much between ordering off_the_menu or the_buffet
very_flavorful_and fresh indian_food here
i_was_in vegas with my_family from_india last summer and_we ate_here
since almost_all of_them are_vegetarian
and_it_was_delicious
the_buffet wasn't_very pricey at_all and_had a_ton_of choices
both veg_and non_veg
definitely_a yummy place_to_eat
i_know it_looks_like you are_going into_a deserted building on_the_strip but_there really_is a_restaurant up_the escalator
hubby i really_enjoyed_the_food
that_said
there_were problems too
our_server asked_us for_a spice_level and we_said mild_and one_dish came out quite_spicy
we_were just_too hungry to send it_back
we_enjoyed it despite being too_hot for_us wimps
the_service_was lacking
to_put it mildly
our_server_was friendly enough but_after being_seated it_took_a solid minutes_before anybody approached our_table_and to_order
and during_the course of_the_meal
more attention from the_server would_have_been nice
if_i_had a do over
i_would_have gone for_the_lunch_buffet which sounds like_a better idea
first
this_review_is_for dinner
the_menu_has a_good_selection_of indian_fare
the_mixed tandoori grill_and two mixed feasts represent a_good mix of_indian_dishes for_those new_to_indian_food
the_food_was_excellent
i_am no expert of_indian_food
but everyone raved_about it
my tamarind shrimp was_definitely spicy
but_not excessively so
the_mixed tandoori grill was_excellent for_those who do_not like spicy_food
the presentation_was good
especially_for the_mixed feasts and the_grill
instead_of just slopping the_various dishes_on_the plate
each one is_in_a nice stainless container
the_service_was_excellent
even_though_we had_a large_party
we_had several people who had_never eaten_indian_food and_the_waiter took_the time to_explain the_various dishes
how to_eat them_and various nuances of_indian_food
recommend
me_and_my mom went_to dinner here_tonight
it_was_awesome and mega yummy
food wise we_got_the petite veggie_samosas
which_were delish
but a_bit small
i_got_a lassi which_was yummy
we also_got rice and_chicken_tikka_masala which was_so_good
i_highly_recommend
we_also_had naan_which_was nothing_special but_good non the_less
now service wise
it_was_great
not_only was_it super quick
and my_water was_always full
everyone_was super_nice
we_had_the best server ever
not_only was he fantastic to_talk_to
very_attentive_and so sweet
he_was also incredibly cute
i_would def rank him in one_of_my_favorite waiters ever
i_cant wait_to_go_back_and eat their again
i rarely write negative reviews
i_wanted_to like_this_place
but the_parking was difficult
the_service_was apathetic and blah
and the_food_was_just
okay
our_order was of_course jacked up
then to cap it_off
got to_wait minutes_for_our bill
there_are_a lot better indian_places within a_few blocks of here
seek them_out
i_gave this two stars_because the_food_was edible
i will_not_be_returning though
have_always loved_this_place
but the_last visits were avg
found_this gem of an_indian_restaurant through yelp while on business in_vegas
this_place serves fantastic_food and appears to_be_a locals hangout
not_a tourist trap
i seriously doubt there_is better indian_food_in_vegas
this_was_my indian_food de flowering experience
so i_don't_really have_a_lot to_compare it_to
i_had always_been hesitant to_try_it because the_curry smelled so strong and_that line from anchorman always made_me cringe
it smells like_a baby's diaper full of_indian_food
was_i a ra tard
my_friends invited my man and_i to_a birthday gathering for_a co_worker and_were raving about_this_place
the_owners have_come to_visit us at_my work on several occasions so i_thought_i could at least go_and see_what it_was_all about
i_knew it was_going_to_be good because_it_was the_only business left in the_building
its located inside the_hawaiian_marketplace building by polo towers
and_there_were a_ton_of indian_people there
always a_good_sign
alex was our_server
he was_very_friendly_and we_left our_dinner in_his hands
what_a smart decision
he_brought out an_amazing prix fixe menu i_think of_his own creation
nice_touch
now_i will_do my best to at least describe my_favorites
little fried dough balls with_peas and_potatoes inside
served_with_a mint cilantro and some_sort_of sweet spicy glaze
tandoori sauce
chicken_tandoori
great_flavor
sweet spicy_and bbq'd to_perfection
lollipop lamb_chops with some_sort_of glaze with_a kick
great_with the_mint cilantro and_sweet spicy_sauce mixed together
chicken_tikka_masala
holy cow
you_must get this_dish
the_curry is mild
its creamy_and a_little_bit_of heaven in_a dish
garlic_nan
garlic flat_bread which_was perfect_for dipping in the_chicken_tikka_masala
i_was_so happy when_we_left
my man and_i actually went_back the_following evening because_i_was craving_it again
just_as_good the_second_time and we_actually got alex as our_server again
he remembered us_from the_night before
another nice_touch
will_be_back again soon
went_here_with of_my_friends for vacation
each meal was_pretty cheap at each
the_waiter was_really_nice offering to_bring two bowls of_rice_and two baskets of_bread which we_didn't know costs us
add in_the automatic gratuity on alcoholic beverages and_you_get
that_was_a surprise to_me
the_food_itself was_ok
nothing spectacular
i_would_have rather spent that money on_a buffet or_something else
this_review_is_for_the lunch_buffet
food on_the_buffet was_good
not_great
too_many vegetarian_dishes
naan_was on_the_buffet
i_prefer fresh_naan brought to_the_table
atmosphere_was depressing
tamba_is in_an indoor
mall
with zero other businesses
you_pay before you_eat which_is fine if_you_have cash for tip
several reviews said non alcoholic drinks are included
that_wasn't the_case on_sunday when we_visited
we_weren't asked_if_we wanted drinks until we_were_seated
since_we already paid
we_decided_to stick_with water
lost revenue on_their part
overall
it_was_ok
my_husband_and_i prefer namaste and mt
everest
as vegas locals
we_will probably_not return_to tamba as the_only draw is_that we_live across_the_street from it
one_thing we_were determined to win at
was having a_great_indian dinner_on the_las_vegas blvd after realizing that_everything else out there_was_only
by chance luck
with_a palate limited to_the vegetarian_options
we hoped that_their popular dishes biryani_and bhindi_masala
were worth_the reviews
surprisingly
they_were of_the finest quality_and taste
we_couldn't have_had a_more enjoyable and ful
filling
dinner
a lil too conservative approach resulted in the_lunch_buffet next day
hmm
we quickly realized that tamba proved to_be merely just another indian_buffet place_for_lunch
definite stop_by for_an exquisite indian_dinner
visit them for_lunch if you must_have indian_lunch_buffet
the review_is completely based off_of_the vegetarian_dishes
not_sure how_they fare at_the non vegetarian_menu
i_was_excited_to discover an_indian_restaurant bang in_the mid of_the_strip
but_is a_disappointment
they_only have buffett for and_no ala cart menu
the_restaurant_has huge seating_area but the_problem is they_have just_one small buffett bar which_makes the_bar really crowded
one literally has_to fight for_the_food
in_a buffett it_is advisable to_have breads served fresh on_the_table but they_had it_in the_bar
cold_and old
any good no
they_are just making money because_of their location
over_all good_food right price however pathetic service attitude of_the_staff including manager there it_took min for_a order_to come_on weekday and tht too it_wasn't complete until_we completed the_entire dinner they_didn't bring the_raita chutney we_ordered and_they tried_to sneak in_the items_in the_bill
won't recommend due_to service_and attitude issue
my_boyfriend_and_i tried_this_place late in_the afternoon and_it_was_pretty empty
the_buffet_was stocked and refreshed while we_ate and_we_had good_service being_seated and at_the_table
i_found_the food flavorful_and enjoyed everything_i tried
which_was a_little_of everything
the_restaurant_was romantic and we_were_able_to have some_great conversation
i would_love_to come_back_here
where_to do_i begin
i_was searching_for a place_to_eat that_would fit my newly discovered vegetarian diet and_be acceptable for_the_rest_of my lady friends_for a night_out
we_walked_in and were_seated
immediately
of_course there were_only other_people in_the_restaurant
the aroma of spices_were all_around and_our appetites were ready_to get down
we_were_greeted by_a gorgeous morrocan man
yay
what_a way to_get_the night started
and soon after_a philipino hottie joined in
two servers four ladies an exciting dining_experience
hakim hooked us up_with suggestions on food and_drinks
that_would_be alcohol beverages
what a_delight
everything_was good
except how distracted our servers would_get
something went wrong_with the_bill
for_them
i_don't_even remember_the details
i_just remember having a_great_time
i've been_back several_times now with_my lady friends
we_always have_a_good time_and good eats at_this_place
if_you_like_indian_food and you're looking_for_a place on_the_strip
this_is it
if you're looking_for_a place to_hit up before a night_out
this_is it
if you're looking_for an_indian_buffet
this_is it
yes
they_do_a lunch_buffet_and the_price_is low
nummy nummy in_our tummy tummies
an_indian_restaurant with some_good and_some mediocre dishes
we_went_there for_the_lunch_buffet on_a_weekday
there_was_a decent selection_of_food in_a nicely_decorated space
there_were lots_of
ethnic
types which_is always a_good_sign
the_chicken_curry
tandoori_chicken_and spiced cauliflower and_potatoes were_excellent
the_naan was_good_and_the dhaal and sambhar were actually not_good
so_there you_have it
also there_was no drink included with_the_meal for
which if fine
but_what i_found quite annoying was that_you had_to prepay and_then if you wanted anything other_than water
pay again
this did_not make_me happy
exc curry
tandoori_chicken
spiced veggies
good decor
ave food
poor paying policy
would i_go_back
probably_not
i_think_i would try another_indian_restaurant first
my_friend was_looking_for a_place_to fit her new diet for_a girls night_out on_the_strip
and_this_is what she found
i_had_never really been into indian_food_before
but_not trying_it and_having other_places
this_place_is pretty_good
the_service_is_good if_you're_a bunch_of girls
haha
there_are a_couple_of waiters that_the girls lust over
so_they definitely pay attention_to us when_we come_in
the_service_has been delayed in_that regard
but_only delayed with_us getting the_check
i've been_there_for the_buffet_and i've ordered individual dishes
i_love every_dish i've_had with_chicken in_it
i_don't usually like curry to much
but i_love_the curry_dishes here
i usually_get on the_spice_level as_well
there_are also a_lamb_dish that is_amazing
which_is best spicy
i_think most things are best spicy
this_is_a great_place_to_go on_the_strip for_indian_food
and if_you_have a_large_group
they_also_have_a back room that people seem_to use quite frequently for large parties
it_was closed even_after they_had taken reservations from us
so either their reservation system was_off
opentable ed it
or they_had to_close for that_day
boyfriend_and_i were in_las_vegas_for a_small getaway
staying a_little off_the_strip was_nice
however
getting food_is_always a pain in_the ass due_to constant tourist everywhere
we_decided we should try somewhere close that
preferably
wouldn't_have very many tourists
bring in tamba
we_made a_reservation thinking the_place would_be jam packed
however
it_was_not
we_were_seated_immediately
not_having to_wait at_all because the_place wasn't crowded at_all
their_chicken_tikka_masala was amazingly good
this_is_one_of_my favorite_dishes
so_i enjoy when_i_go to an_indian_place that_really makes_it the_way i_like_it
their naan_was_also delicious
we_got_the garlic_naan
as_well_as_the alu naan
which was_also_very_good
i'd_definitely go_here again if_i am in_the_area
it_is somewhat off_the beaten path
i_don't_think the tourist have really found_this gem of_a_restaurant
great nan and_vegan_options on menu
will_be_back_for buffet
my first_time_here
the sunday buffet dinner was_just amazing
the idlis were_so soft
they_just melted in_my_mouth
you_must try_this south_indian dish_to believe_it
one_of_the best idlis i_have_eaten outside india
i_had_to take a_star off because_they employ kids to_serve water_and plates
somehow dint like the_idea_of that
great_food
love the_fact_that some_of it_is from south_india
decor_is_nice
they_have_a really big lavish room in_the_back as_well_as_a spacious dining_room and
patio
seating
service_was_good
their ice tea is_super good
and_the bathrooms are_really cool
i'm_a sucker for nice bathrooms
also
you_can get free parking with_this_place
i'm sold
it_is
however
in_the_back of_a deserted strip_mall
but_if_you can_get over that_its a_good_place_to visit
i_have_to_say
the_food made_it all and_the_food_was stellar
great amount of_vegetarian choices spiced just_right and_with_a perfect_amount of kick
nothing was_bland
and_everything_was presented beautifully
really great_place
i'll stop_by here_again next_time i'm_in_vegas
good_lunch_buffet
we_tried veg biriyani it_was_excellent
it's_right on strip
i_would_recommend to_anyone_looking_for veg indian_food
it's difficult_to find restaurants that_are unique_and not homogenized and typical vegas style americanized offerings
we_were_in the_mood_for indian_and with_the help of the_yelp app
found_this_place and quickly made a_reservation through opentable
the reservation wasn't really necessary since upon arrival
there_were plenty of tables available
we_were_seated and_it_took much longer than necessary for any_of_the servers to acknowledge us_and provide menus
drinks
etc
i_think_this was_because there_was_a large_party in_the_back room which occupied their time
this party also_had_a buffet setup that contained some_of_the most unique_and appetizing indian_food_i had_ever seen
unofortunately it_was_not open to people outside_of their party
shucks
the food_was_decent and_the_price was_ok
i_was glad_that we_had_the opportunity_to not eat_in another casino buffet_or chain restaurant
if_you_like_indian
check_this_place out
we_ordered the_saag_paneer
malai_kofta_and naan
the_food was_quite_good and_the_naan just melt in_your_mouth
the_decor_is pretty_nice too
service_was_attentive
the_food_was reasonably_priced
the_only_reason_i did_not give_this_place_a star is_because they_didn't_have air conditioning on and_it_was_a hot_and humid las_vegas evening
after many visits saying
gee
we should try tamba
we_finally did
we visted on a_sunday_night and_found the place_to_be nearly full_and almost everyone_was indian always a_good_sign that_the food_is_pretty authentic
they_had two_different
feasts
so we_got one_of each
both gave_us_a good sampling_of what tamba has_to_offer
since we_shared
it meant just_a taste_of each_item but_all were_very_good
the_vegetarian version_of the feast started_with samosas followed by saag_paneer
dal and_a korma not_sure of the_name along_with really_good naan
the_meat version started_with an_awesome tandoori_chicken followed by rogan_josh
chicken_tikka_masala_and dal
all really_good
service_was_good
i_saw someone posted they_did_not have_a c the_night we_went
there_were_no issues with temperature so_that's likely just_a one_time issue
after_reading all_the reviews_and not haven indian_food_at all on_our vacation i_was looking_forward_to experiencing some authentic_indian_food
but_even though they_say they_are_open on thursdays when_we_got there they_were_closed
make_sure_you call first
the_food_was_fantastic
my biggest disappointment was the_bar
we_wanted martinis
bartender said they_were_out_of martini glasses
one drink_was so bad
we_had_to send it_back
if_the drinks_were as_good_as_the food
i_would_give it_stars
the_host and waiter were super_nice_and friendly
but i'm_sure it's_also bc they_were checking us_out the_whole time_we_were_there
the_most horrible indian_food i_have_eaten after coming to_us
being in_las_vegas does not mean that_you_can charge your customers a fortune for crappy food
the food_tasted like the_ones served_in hospitals with_no spices
no aroma and no_flavor
everything_was just boiled and_served
there_are_plenty_of other options in_vegas_for indian_food
please skip this useless place
food is_ok
limited variety
insanely expensive
i_arrived at vegas and_was searching_for good restaurants
my_friend who resides there did mention_that this_is_an overly hyped place_because of_its prime location
i ignored that and_did go_there
there_was some_good side dish like raita
aloo_gobi
but_i_did not_know with which main course should i_have it along_with
do they expect me to_have rice_and sambar with aloo_gobi as palya
and all_this after paying bucks
thanks giving dinner
and_no fried_rice or biryani in_the_buffet spread
naan was_ok
for_the_price i_paid i_could_have gone else where
and_be satisfied
closing comments
go_here if you earned too_much from gambling and do_not know_what_to do_with all_that money
lunch_buffet
poor tasting_food
they tried_to cover the_taste w spiciness
would_not_recommend
i_was_a_bit hesitant from_the looks outside_and that_there_was not a_lot_of patrons inside so_i passed
but came_back the_night after
come to_find_out
the patrons are mostly indian
good_sign
the_food_was_delicious
i_had_the fish masala
spicy
with_rice
onion_naan
plus tamarind mint_chutney
everything_was_great
service_was more 'human' than_other restaurants on_the_strip
prices_were not_bad
every_time i_go_to vegas
i_get really_excited because_i know i'll be shoving delicious_food from tamba into_my gullet
most_people get excited_about vegas because_of_the debauchery they_are about_to partake in
yes
yes
that's all_good and_well done
but aside from_my roulette high
tamba_is why_i sing viva las_vegas
go for_the_lunch_buffet_and you_will see_what i_mean it's a_vegetarian dream
there's like veggie items_on_the huge buffet_and the_naan_is soooooooo good
i_will warn you
it_gets crazy sometimes on_weekends
line out the_door
raita and chutney slinging to_and fro
elbowing people out_of_the way for the_last scoop_of halva
etc
but
it's_worth_the madness
p
s
handy dandy tip
when_you_are in_your hotel room look_for the_coupon that gives you_off the_buffet
i randomly came across this when_i flipped through_the vegas magazine last_time_i was_at caesar's palace soaking in_the tub
also
if_you_like even_more heat
they_will hook you up_with_some extra hot_sauce
just ask
do you_know how hard it_is to_find vegetarian food_in_vegas
i didnt think it_would_be that difficult
but turns out_all people want_to_eat when_they gamble is crab legs and steak
after walking forever and searching endlessly on_yelp
finally we_found vegetarian_food
they_have_some meat items like chicken_tikka_masala
but tons_of veg options
at least in the_lunch_buffet
the idly are fluffy_and the_sambar is_very_good
the_paneer_was mostly missing in action and not_very_good when_it_was to be_found
but_the halwa was_delicious
given that_it_was lunchtime
i'm shocked that_this_place wasnt more crowded
in_fact
there were_only a_couple other patrons there
they_are kind of tucked_away
cheapest buffet ever
it_was small
but_only like and_had many good options
to_find it_just follow the signs
and they'll lead you into some weird sliding glass doors of_a deserted looking building
then go up_some escalators and you're there
lunch_buffet_here is_not attracting as other_indian cuisines
every_time i've_been_to vegas i_have_been wanting to_try_out this_restaurant
so_this past weekend when_i_was in vegas_i dragged my_partner there
he_had the_tikka_masala_and i_had_the_chicken tandoori
sharing basmati_rice_and naan_bread
my_meal was utter perfection
the_service_was adequate
we_were_not in_any sort of hurry
my_only_complaint_is that_i wished the_buffet option was_available for_dinner
i_will_definitely_go there the_next_time i_am_in_vegas
dinner prices_are_very_reasonable
it's surprising how_busy it_can_be considering the_location way back in_a plaza with nothing else there
they_offer_a multisampler dinner which gives you small_portions of or things
i_got_the buddah's delight which_included a_few vegetarian_dishes_and also included rice_and_naan for but i_didn't_like everything that_was offered
i_would rather just have_one large portion_of a_dish i_really_liked for instead
the_saag_paneer was_incredible
it's amazing how every restaurant does it differently
this_was more pureed than others
i_looked at_their selection for_the_lunch_buffet_and it_still looks great
look_forward_to checking it_out again
i_recently went from mild vegetarian to full on vegan
i cook a_lot at_home because its_not easy finding restaurants to_eat_at
especially in_las_vegas
the steakhouse capital of the_world
i_decided i_needed to_get out_for valentine's day_and chose to_go indian
i_came across tamba's amazing website and easily made_up my_mind
after making_the reservation i_read a_few revues on google and_they worried me a_bit
but_i wasn't going_to_be shaken
i'm_so glad_i stayed with_it
i loved_this_place
staff_was_very_friendly_and the_food_was_delicious
we_tried_the bhel_puri for an_appetizer
based off_of_the waiters recommendation
great choice
then for_entrees we_went_with the_aloo_gobi chana_masala
both_were amazing_and complimented each_other nicely
great_for sharing
she went_with_a glass_of house chard
which turned_out_to be mondavi
nice
and i_tried one_of_the many_indian imported beers
hayward was the_beer i_went_with and was_perfect
gotta find_that at lee's discount liquor
hope_they have_it
one side note
when_they ask you_for bread
it's_not included
that_was awkward
also
parking_is a_bit rough
over_all this_was probably one_of_the least expensive vday dinners i've ever_had and_also one_of_the most satisfying
we_had_a really lovely experience
the_ambiance_is tasteful
and_our service_was_very_friendly and_helpful
he politely explained the items_on_the_menu since_we proved to_be indian_food dummies
tamba does not open until
parking can_be_a_bit confusing
there is_a_lot behind mcdoanld's
there_is_a booth with_a parking attendant
says
we told_them we_had_a dinner reservation at tamba and_he let us right_in
no necessary
we_tried_the cheese appetizer served_with spicy mint sauce
tamarind_sauce and crackers
it_was_really_good
we_had lamb_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
eggplant
types_of naan
and_basmati_rice
the_sauces on_the chicken_and_lamb were_excellent but the_meat_was dry in_both
the_eggplant was_out_of_this_world
everything had great_flavor
i_would_definitely_go back and_i'm recommending it_to all
we spent for with_all_the aforementioned and large beers
worst service
the_waiters did_not care to_check back on_our_table
we_had_to speak to the_manager_and they_all
including the_manager
were rude_and arrogant
we will_never go_back_to this_place_again
food_was_just average as_well
hidden on_the_strip
this_restaurant_is an absolute delight
we_have_eaten here_many_times always great_experience
this_place is_really_good
we_have_been here for_lunch_buffet
it_was_great
amazingly huge
we_have_had dinner ala_carte and_it_was even_better
true indian_restaurant food
very falvorful and they_actually used real spices
very_good quality
it pains me_to give_stars to_this_place when my_first_experience here only less than two months_ago warranted about_a ish rating
my_boyfriend_and_i came_in here_about an_hour before closing and instead_of being greeted with_a
hello
how are_you this evening
spiel
we_were_told right_off_the bat to_order only_one entree since the_kitchen was closing soon
i_thought_that was_a_bit harsh and strange as the_dining_area was_a_little more_than half_full already
the kicker was a_group_of women that showed up about_minutes prior_to closing and the_same host was taking care and doting over them with open arms
guess you_have_to show some skin
cleavage
possibly more
to override the rules
eh
service here_on the_whole part is_excellent
the_food_here_is excellent_and very_fresh
however
i_highly do recommend not_to order spicy_as the_last dish_i ordered_was heavily overpowered with chili powder
but_no taste
order medium
if_you_want_a kick
but_still can enjoy the_flavors
portions_are not big
but_that_is perfectly fine as_they are_definitely filling
the_garlic_naan_is good
samosas_are forgettable and_not worth_it by_any_means
the_korma is_great
and i_highly_recommend_the yellow cumin rice as_a side dish as_it_is superb
the_other knock off is_that_they automatically added gratuity to the_bill
it's one_thing if_it_was a_group_of people and_i understand that
but for_just two people
at least have a_sign at_the_front desk or_something on_the_menu_that says this is_going_to_be enforced
it_has nothing to_do_with us being cheap tippers or_anything as we_both vary between to on tipping
dependent on food service etc
i_know the_last_time_i went_with my_boyfriend_and a close friend_of our's
this did_not occur
was_it because_we
inconvenienced
them by coming in an_hour before closing since_the tone of_the voice and body language of the_host made_it obvious
bizarre to_say_the least and_this definitely did_not go over well_with the_bf one bit
the redemption was later on when_i won money on_the slots at paris to cover up the_dinner cost
pricey
yes
but_what do_you expect in_vegas
for channa_masala
garbanzo beans in_a sauce
is hilarious as_you_can go get_a trader joe's frozen version_of the_same_thing taste for around_and change
expect_to_pay at least nearly a_person to give_you_a gauge of what_to_expect
unfortunately
this last experience did_not go over well at_all
especially_with my_boyfriend
we won't be_coming back_and we'll look for_another indian_food_restaurant avenue that_will hopefully show more class to its customers when we_visit vegas again
bad_food
buffet_is for and_my statement had_a charge of
my_friend_had the_same charge
food_was cold_and not_indian
tucked_away in_a quiet part_of the_hawaiian_marketplace
this little_gem is a_perfect spot to escape the hustle and bustle of_the_strip
just steps from the_actual strip
the_lunch_buffet offers a_great_value and_authentic indian_fare
requested pander tikki_masala per other yelp user
excellent dish
solid service
only_complaint_is they_charge for_rice
i_hate that
it_was_a_great restaurant
it_was decently priced_and excellent_food
the_decor_was inviting
this_place_is legit
hidden in_a_strip_mall and filled_with indian clientele
went_in for_buffet night_and was so_happy
got_to try_everything from goat_curry
delicious and_tender
to chicken marsala
well_worth_it
the_buffet_was big with_many choices for_everyone
bar service needs a_little help but_hey
i_should_have just ordered beer_and not_a vodka tonic
will_be_back
this_place_is an exotic gem hidden inside_the crappiness that_is the_hawaiian_marketplace
walking through this rundown strip_mall and into_a mysteriously empty building and up_the escalator
i_did_not expect to_find_a beautiful atmosphere of_indian decor
i_really regret ordering take_out instead_of staying to_dine_in but my_friends_and_i all picked up food_from various places_and we_wanted_to eat together
i_was immediately greeted by_a gentleman who gave_me helpful suggestions on_all of_their vegan_friendly items
this made ordering very easy for_me
while there_were several options
i decided_on the_following
kali dal
slow cooked black lentils and_spices
http
su
pr wv z
veggie_samosas
about or pieces
http
su
pr wadc
tandoori roti whole_wheat flat_bread
basmati_rice
one sad thing_about take_out is_that_the presentation is_not as elegant
however
it smelled good
it_tasted good
and i_was_happy
my_friends were definitely peering over at my_food
i_even gave away one_of_my tasty veggie_samosas
for_the that i_paid
i_had_a full vegan meal plus enough leftovers_for a_second meal which tasted just_as_good two evenings later
my_boyfriend_and_i were starving and didn't_want_to walk very far_from mgm for_dinner
we_found_this_place on_yelp_and were skeptical about_the_place since the_location was_quite hidden and_not many_people were dining_in
anyway
we_were_there last_night
it was_our_first_time to_have indian_cuisine
so_we absolutely didn't know what_to_order
our_server_was very welcoming
friendly
and_very informative
he_made very_good recommendations for_our_entrees which_was called karahi chicken
it_was_awesome
it_had the_right_amount_of spice_and had such_a_great thick blend_of curry with_onions tomatoes
peppers
and cilantro
served_with garlic flavored nan
i_ordered_the ashoka's feast which consisted a taste_of india's most popular dishes and_that_was amazing
so to sum it_up
great_service from our_waiter
great_food because my_boyfriend was_very_happy at_the_end_of dinner
even though he_was feeling down when_he lost gambling
lol
had_dinner_here with_my fiance when_we_were in_vegas
the_food_was_excellent
we_ordered kurkari bhindi
mutter_paneer
garlic_naan_and rice
everything_was excellent
the bhindi was_spicy_and tasted_great
the_paneer_was rich_and went_well with_the_garlic naan_and_rice
the_only_reason i'll dock a_star from this_place_is because_of_the service
although initially
we_didn't
have_any issues with being_seated and_all
the_service slowed down throughout_the night
it ended with_a long_wait for the_bill after we_were_done and my_drink never_really being filled up during_dinner
i_will_definitely_go back another time though
and_if the_service improves next_time i'll easily give_this_place_a full stars
this_is a_hidden_gem on the_las_vegas strip
it's not_in_a casino
you_can't see it from_the_strip
it's tucked_away behind the_hawaiian_marketplace
and_it_is totally_worth the journey to_get there
i_think one way to_judge quality_and authenticity of_a_restaurant is by_the clientele
there_were many_people of_indian descent here
and_that made_us even_more excited for_our feast
and what_a feast it_was
i_had ashoka's feast which_included and appetizer and_then four small dishes_and rice
it_also included naan
and_this_was the_first_time_i had ever_been_to an_indian_restaurant where i_did_not have_to_order more naan
they_served plenty
the_lamb roganjosh was prepared_with a_perfect blend_of_spices
the_chicken_masala also prepared just to_taste
everything_was very_flavorful_and though try described it_as spicey
nothing_was too spicey
this meal also included_a donuthole dessert with_a sweet caramel sauce
they were_able_to accommodate our large_party
on relatively short notice for a_saturday_night
if_you're_in_the mood for_indian_food while on_the_strip
check out tamba
the_staff_was extraordinarily attentive_and professional
best_indian_buffet i've_had in_my_life and i'm_not exaggerating
the_dishes that_should be_spicy were actually spicey
very_affordable and_although the_building looks a_little rundown on_the_outside
it's_nice and_clean on_the_inside
the_hostess was_friendly
too
only_thing_that could've been_better was_the_naan
it_wasn't crispy at_all
but_what do_you expect unless it's made_to_order
parking sucks here
so try not_to drive
once you_get over that
then you_have_to find_it
it's upstairs in the_hawaiian_marketplace
they_have_a lunch_buffet_for which_is dang good
usual suspects on_this buffet_and probably like total choices of_things to_eat
i've also eaten here_for_dinner w an_indian client of_mine
and_when you_eat there_for_lunch you_will see indians eating_there too
great sign in_my_book
i_love_their indian techno music
they_have_a very_nice motif
it's very_clean
and_the_staff_is on_it
you_can be in_and_out of here
minus parking
at_lunch time_in mins if you needed to_be
only buffet for_dinner tonight but_still busy at opening time
great_service
very_friendly_and accommodating
took_our coupon_for off two entrees even_though_we couldn't order_off_the_menu
food_was_excellent
we_took the advice of several yelpers and parked at planet hollywood where we_enjoyed happy_hour and_then walked to the_hawaiian_marketplace
i'd_love to_go_back to_tamba
legit spot_for hangover brunch
if_you_can wake up early enough_for it
i'm_very critical of_indian_restaurants but_this lunch_buffet hits_the spot like_a triple chilled
quintuple distilled
boutique vodka
service_is hit_or_miss but_the_food makes_up_for_it
if you're jonesing for different edible fare in_vegas in between_the buffets and_the subway in_that crappy casino on_the_strip
this_is_a solid choice to soak up_your alcohol indiscretions
if you shoot fire out_of your bunghole the_next_day
it_might_be tamba
then_again
it_might_be the result of table_service at marquee
who knows
awesome indian_buffet
went_there_for late dinner
pm ish and it_was_still packed_with people
were indians
it_is_always a_good_thing when_you see natives having a_meal at_their restaurant
most_of_the meat_dishes were spicy_but tasty
like_their selections of_dishes
salad
fried veggie
flat_bread
some curry sauces
lamb goat_curry
chicken
good_price too
look_for their coupon at_the vegas guidebook ask your hotel
even_though_it is_a_little hard_to find upstairs in the_hawaiian_marketplace
this_place_is totally amazing once_you get_there
we_go_to vegas about twice a_year and we_always make_a point_of going_to tamba's lunch_buffet during our_trip
if_you_like_indian_food this_place_is_amazing
the_food_is_fresh_and delicious
the_ambiance inside_is super_nice_and the_service_is_great
not_to_mention the_price_is so_good for_all_the wonderful_food they_offer
this_is second time i_visited tamba while on trip_to strip
again same absolutely fine taste of_indian cousin
probable i_would return again to_this_restaurant to_taste it's_all items
stars_for_the mango_lassi
i_liked_the juice
yogurt ratio
there_is more juice so_the consistency isn't too rich_and thick
it's_easy_to sip through_the straw and afterwards it_doesn't feel like_you ate a liquid dessert
stars
we_shared_the ashoka's feast which_was_good but not_great
in_my_opinion
the_spices were_a_bit muted
i_like indian_food_that is tantalizing and i_love_it when_i taste new combination_of spices
but
ashoka's feast didn't do_that for_me
i'd_definitely come_back_and try_other entrees
overall
stars
this_spot is_definitely_a good eatery if_you're_in vegas_and on_a budget
the_service_is_great and the_ambience is_warm_and soothing
as_for it's location
it_is in_the_middle_of strip so_it's not_too hard_to get_there
just walk over
break a_little sweat
and stuff your_face with_some good_food
excellent_food
just check to_make_sure they_are still serving your favorite things
i_was_very disappointed_that they_didn't_have the_two items_that were_the sole reasons i_came back_to_this_place and_brought a_friend
papad and gajar halva
the_food_is still very_good so_i would rate it high
it's my fault i_didn't check to_see_if they_still had my_favorite items
also if_you_get to_the marketplace after
you won't have_to_pay and call to_make_sure that they_will actually open at
because today they_opened later
ish
still food worth waiting_for but
may_have been_able_to save money on parking and_just gone later
you_will_not_be_disappointed
a_must go for_everyone
i_was relaly looking_forward_to this_place but was_disappointed upon arrival to_find_out that_they_are only serving a_buffet
the_spice_level on_the_buffet was low
i_did enjoy_the variety_of_food but would_have preferred to have_ordered off_the_menu
order the_chicken_korma it is_to_die_for
garlic or plain_naan with yellow or basmati_rice_and you_are set
tamba has_to_be the_nicest indian_restaurant i've ever_eaten in
the_interior_is extremely well done
just had_to_be said
anyway
the_food is_one_of_the_best i've sampled in_the_city
quality_is high
flavors_are pretty authentic
and the_selection_is great
prices_are high like most_indian_restaurants
the_lunch_buffet is_one_of_the_best as_well
selection_is diverse and the_flavors_are not watered_down for mass production
pricing is_a_little higher than usual
but_it_is on_the_strip after_all
it's_also somewhat hard_to find if you've never been_there
dinner_is their strong suit
if you're looking for_indian_food_and don't mind paying a_little for a_great_experience this_is your spot
doesn't get worst than_this bland indian dinner_buffet
ok customer_service
pretty expensive_for the_quality_of buffet but_that_is probably because_it_is vegas
i_was_excited_to know_about the presence of an_indian_restaurant right on_the_strip
and_we_were happy_to shell out bucks
including tax
for_a dinner_buffet for two_of_us
which_is highest that_i_have paid_for an_indian_buffet
the_experience turned_out_to be just_okay
the_quality_of_food was not_bad
in_fact
the_naan_and gulab_jamun
dessert
were_excellent
and most_of_the other_items
except idlis and sambhar were_also okay
not_great
idlis were certainly stale by at least a_day
i_have more problem_with the_variety aspect of_the_buffet
i_have_seen more variety in buffets
the_number_of vegetarian_entrees especially was limited
how_can any indian_buffet be complete without a_single paneer entree
and_really
zucchini as an_entree in an_indian_buffet
o also
i_would_expect more starters than_just pakodas and_at least
a complimentary chai in_a buffet
chai_was
and_wasn't good
next_time
if_you_are on_the_strip and_you crave for_indian_food
take_the deuce to_indian masala
you_can thank me by_a

looking_for someplace to_eat around_pm and stumbled across tamba
looked it_up on_yelp
and_decided_to check_it_out based_on_the reviews
it_wasn't crowded at_that hour
but there_was_a steady stream of_customers
many of_them india
food_was_great lots_of great choices at_the_buffet
filled my_plate before getting to the_meats
at_first was dismayed
because_i didn't_want_to waste food
but_i put away the_first round in_no time_and headed back_for_the vindaloo i missed the_first_time through
yum
not_sure when i'll get_back to_vegas
but_if i_do
tamba will see me again for_sure
note
i'm_not an_indian_food expert
we_don't have_many indian_restaurants_in hawaii
but what_i tastes at tamba i_really_enjoyed
from_a gori
this_restaurant changed my_mind about_indian_food
i'd tried_indian twice before_and hated it
my_bf
who_is from mumbai
persuaded me to_give his nationality's dishes one_more shot
most_people go_to_indian buffets
a cheaper and pretty_good option
but_i went initially to_a normal meal
i_loved_it
the_butter_chicken melted in_my_mouth and_i_was ravenous after the_chutneys
i'm converted
i_love_indian_food now thanks_to tamba
note
although technically on_the_strip
it_is isolated from_the crowds and meets a steady stream of repeat customers
i_must_say
the_variety at_this indian_buffet was impressive
also food_was_good_and fresh
butter_chicken was_really_tasty
i'm not_too sure_what is_going on_here
i_looked at_this restaurant's yelp profile and_it lists their hours
pm for_the_lunch_buffet after getting back_from vegas
according_to the profile they_are supposed_to reopen at
we_went_here around
not knowing what their hours were and_they_were of_course closed
on_the business hours listed on_their door there_was no mention_that they reopen at
otherwise we_would_have held off and_waited
in_a city that never sleeps it_makes sense that_they_have the hours posted on_yelp_and not_what we_saw on the_door when_we tried_to go_in and dine there
tamba
indian_restaurant on_the_strip
authentic and_it_has spacious dining_area
we_had been_there_for lunch_buffet_and to_my_surprise i_had_to pay the_bill before_you kick off your lunch
there_are not_too many_items when compared_to_other_indian buffets
idly's
too hard and totally disappointed
most_of_the indian's hesitate_to eat idly's which_are not soft
it's my_personal comment
we_had pakoda and_tandoori_chicken which_are fine and_i_would expect_to have_more starters
chicken_curry was_the_best among the_buffet_and also tasted couple_of vegi curries chole
chick_peas
and dal
little expensive_for such kind of_food
it's las_vegas_and won't comment about the_cost
totally it_was_not a_great_indian buffet
easily my fave indian in_the_valley
great_location w surprisingly convenient parking
for the_strip
best buffet of_its kind in_town
very nicely remodeled dining_area restrooms a_few yrs back
we_found_this_place one_day when_we_were walking along the_strip_and i_was_not feeling well
i_have hypoglycemia and had_not eaten_in several hours
we_had_been wondering around_the hawian marketplace and_i_was feeling so bad i_was_not sure what_i_was doing
we_went_in the_building which sadly is deserted on_the first floor and_one_of the_employees directed us upstairs
he could_see i_was ill and_got the_manager who immediately got us a_table
once i_had_been seated_and started getting back_to normal we_ordered
i_had_the butter_chicken which was_amazing_and my_bf had_the curried goat
our_waiter_was shocked he asked_for_the goat and_had to_make_sure they_still had_some but came_back smiling and letting us_know it_was_still available
he said_it_was fantastic
our_waiter was_attentive_and kept a positive attitude even though and_indian couple behind us_ordered several things and_kept sending them back unhappy he never lost patience with anyone
it_was_a_great meal and_we would_go_back
at_the_time one_of_the half price outlets had coupons to reduce the_price
we_also ate_here on christmas day for_the_lunch_buffet_and while it_was_good none_of_the entrees_were marked and_even a_few indian customers questioned what the_dishes_were
i_was_not nearly as impressed_with_the buffet
i_enjoyed_the lunch_buffet
famished after_a flight
pretty_tasty
but leaning to_the spicy side
a_couple_of chicken_dishes including a_nice tikka_masala_and good tandoori
no lamb
goat
or tofu
no beverages other_than water were_offered
i_like the_one_i frequent in laurel md a_lot better
had_a vegetarian_dinner buffet_but did_not like anything neither starters nor main course
best lunch in_town
fresh_food
well_cooked curries_and melting appetizers
the_place_is perfect blend_of ambience_and awesome_food
have visited it many_times_and still looking_forward_to more visits
wait times are awful and_the_service_is horrendous
food was_mediocre at_best
best_indian_restaurant on_the vegas_strip
very_good indian_buffet
buffet_is worth_every_penny
ambience_is amazing
food_is subpar and highly priced because it's_located on_the_strip
tried_the_lunch_buffet
it_was_pretty_good and_had_a decent number_of dishes
dessert could have_been_better
the_ambience is_amazing_and service_is_great too
best_indian_food on vegas_strip and the_employees are_pretty friendly
must visit
the_food_was_delicious
the_service_was not
i'm_not sure_if our asian
perhaps philipino
waiter did_not_have strong english but_he would_not take_my order_to switch the_paneer for veggies
i_asked_if the_paneer in_my dish could_be substituted for veggies_and he kept trying_to convince me to_get_a completely different dish
it_was_very frustrating i've never dealt with_that before
finally i became extremely irritated and_told him to_go ask because that's_all i_wanted
sure enough i_got what i_asked_for which restaurants are_usually very_accommodating about so_i figured he was_just_a bad waiter
the little_gem hidden inside_the thriving vegas_strip
the_buffet the_previous night not_only disappointed us but_was high on meat
so_we_decided to_try_the indian_place out for_lunch_buffet
keeping in_mind our friend's recommendation
the spread was apt
with veg_dishes having an upper hand
delicious
warm decor_and excellent_service
if_you_are having that sudden craving_for desi food in_the_middle_of_the strip
look nowhere else
food_was_amazing and service_was_great
i_got_a thali dinner
off_the_menu
the thail is_a sampling_of differnt dishes
i_got_a vegetatian thali option which_came_with somosas and nana
however
i_gave them my gluten_free card explaining my dietary restrictions and they_made some_great adjustments giving me some_other great veggie_options and replace my fried carrot dessert with mango_ice_cream
husband ordered_a_chicken thali plate_and love_it
i_will be_back_for_more
before posting
went_back a_second time with_friends
be_warned items_on_the_menu do_not come_with rice_or nana
it_was_about for_rice
for nana
order the_thali plate instead
it_came_with the_rice_and nana
food_was_still great second time_around
we_visited tamba during_our vegas trip and_it_has the_best_indian place on_the_strip
the_price_is reasonable
food_was_fresh and_tasty
service_was_great too
mediocre
we_paid bucks per_person for_a dinner_buffet that_was acceptable for_a
lunch
staff was_fine
taste and_quality very underwhelming
i_usually eat so_much at an_indian_buffet that_i_am near exploding
but_not this_time
i_tried_it all
how does this_restaurant have
stars
the_food_was mediocre at_best
and_there really was_no service
so_i_can't even write anything about_it
the pakodas were downright pathetic
the navrattan korma_was drowning in_an unappetizing cream_sauce
the_naan came out_of_a freezer i'm_sure
the_saag was the_worst i've ever_had
the_dal was_ok
but_that's because_it_is almost impossible to screw up_a dal
i_did like the_raita though
the_dessert was_probably for diabetics
honestly
if there_wasn't_a sign there_that said_it_was kheer
i_wouldn't have_known
seriously
it needed much_more sugar
some cardamom
saffron
nuts and needed to_be made by someone who knows what kheer is
now comes the funny part
they_make you_pay before_you even sit down
what_is this
a_restaurant or_a school cafeteria
our glasses_were refilled only once and_our dirty plates were never cleared
needless_to say
i_did_not leave_a tip
good_food
we_tried there dal and baigan bharatha it_was_very_good
panner was_ok
i_am_not big_fan_of paneer anyways
i_will_go_back here_if i_am_in town
no cocktails on menu
great_taste on tamba indian reastorant food_was_amazing and service_was_very_good i been_there last month find_this_place to on_yelp he always help
i_go_there to dinner_with my_family it s amazing love his_food
spicley butter_chicken_was so_great so_many itam on buffett plan naan great and_sweet res malaie very_very great_taste customer_service was_so_nice
if_i go next_time in_vegas deffinatly i_go tamba again
love his_food
great
worst food
they_don't know_how_to make dal tadka
mutter_paneer infact not_even masala papad
they_should realize idli is_not whiskey
the older the_better
we_had great_food_and service_from anand
he_had great recommendations and_was thoughtful about_the timing of_everything
we_ordered_a chicken_tikka korma_and the_aloo_gobi
both_were delicious_and one_of_them was off_the_menu
the tamarind_sauce was_great
ambiance_was good_the entrance to_the mall is_off putting but_once inside its very comfortable
best_indian_buffet i_had_in sequence of indian_buffets the_long weekend n monday
parking_is nightmare
unless some had_a better idea
went herewith my_friends_and had_the_lunch_buffet
very_limited choices
only chicken_and vegetarian
naan_was crispy
not much_more to_say
don't_let_the location distract you
this_is_a real gem
we had_the_chicken_tikka_masala and_the_butter_chicken both_were great
the_mango_lassi_was very_tasty too
i_would strongly recommend_you leave the_standard food on_the_strip and_enjoy this_place
middle_of_the grade food
went_there with a_large_group for_the_lunch_buffet
watch out
the strip_mall where_they reside is_actually a ghost town with_this the_only establishment that's viable
but_once_you get past that
the_food_is a_solid
b grade
stay away from their_tandoori_chicken or_the
paalak paneer
gravy dish
my_friends had_a
difficult afternoon
shall we say mildly after the_meal
they_also refused to split the_bill amongst the_of_us who wanted_to pay separately on_our credit cards
the_person serving us
suggested
that_we charge it on_one card and deal_with splitting the_bill ourselves in_a not very_polite way
place_is convenient on_the_strip and price_was person
mostly catered towards vegeterian but_the_food_was alright for_the_price and location
service_was_quick and_efficient and_the allowed us_to linger for a_bit while_we talked and took_our time_with our_food
disappointed they_didn't_have any dessert at_the_buffet
not_a_big_fan_of eating_indian_food while travelling as_i get_enough of_it in bay_area
but_this being_a common popular place in_the_middle_of_the strip i_thought_i will_give it_a_try
the knowledgeable people i_asked eho have good_indian_food reviewing skills all told_me this_place_is extraordinarily ordinary
its usp is it's location
they_were_all right
our friends were feeling indian
so we_came_here to this_indian_restaurant
this is_located_in the_hawaiian_marketplace between_the mgm and planet hollywood filled_with many vendors and eateries so it_may be_hard to_find
going inside the_building where this restaurant_is_located was_kind_of creepy because_it_was super empty
however
going inside the_restaurant
we_saw multiple patrons enjoying their_food and_the_atmosphere proved to_be_very cool and_modern
i_shared an_order_of malai_kofta_and chicken_tikka_masala_with my_bf
because_we_were hungry but_not super hungry
hahaha what does that mean i_don't get myself
anyways both items were_really_good
my_boyfriend_and_i gobbled both of_them up
portions_were pretty big compared_to_other_indian restaurants_i've_been_to
also their bowls are pretty_cool
they_were shaped like_a spoon
you_have_to see it
i can't_really explain the weird shape right_now
but need_to_be handled to great care as_you_can easily spill whatever item on_your pants
like my_boyfriend on_his favorite khakis
rip favorite khakis
waiters here were_pretty friendly
cool
and funny
what_i liked was_that they_kept filling up my_water
it's_like they_know me
they_know i_need_to quench my thirst
overall
a_good_time having_indian_food here_in_vegas
i_definitely would_come here_again for some_indian_food
enjoy
worst indian_food ever_tasted
price
is_too high taking full advantage_of strips
if you_really want_to_eat don't_go for_indian_food on strips
better to_try_something else
nice_and tasty_food
reasonably_priced
great_location
upscale ambience
good_service
worth_the visit
everything about_this_place_is excellent
i happen_to love_indian_food
i eat_it all_the_time and_this is_some_of_the_best i_have_ever_had
i_had_the chicken_korma and_it_was superb
pricing was spot_on for_the_quality
actually i_would_have gladly paid more
i_gave the_friendly waiter a_nice tip instead
the_environment was_also quiet
modern
clean
and_welcoming with nice soft lighting and interesting art work that_really sets the_mood
it is_a_great retreat from_the hustle and bustle of_the_strip
the_service_was_also excellent
the_staff_were friendly_and_attentive and_always had smiles on_their faces
the_food also came very quickly
i_also have to_give_them props on_their choice_of bowls used for serving rice_and curry
they_use bowls with_a slant cut opening which_makes it_really easy_to pour serve from without making_a mess
they_also_had very_clean
modern_and orderly restrooms which_is an absolute must for_a fine_dining location
a establishment
d
friendly_and quick_service
admittedly very early in their_dinner hours so near empty
good_food
not_the_best but no_complaints
especially the_naan
nice_atmosphere inside
and reasonable_prices for vegas
i went_to_this_place while hiding from some weirdo who_was chasing me down_the vegas_strip
this_place_has lovely decor and_a_nice ambience
the_buffet_is
with tax
but_there's not too_much to_choose_from_and they_only serve water
great_flavor better than_what_i had_at a_more expensive buffet
but i_would_have_liked to_see more variety_and something to_drink other_than water
pleasant staff
great_food
really_like_the ambience_and food
sambar was_excellent
must_try indian_food if_you_are on strip
tucked_away on_the_strip in the_hawaiian_marketplace area
this_is a_hidden_gem
so i'll admit it was_my_first_time having_indian_food
luckily i_was meeting friends_who had_some knowledge about_it and helped me_out on_what to_have
we_went 'family style' so we_were_able_to taste a_little_bit_of_everything we_ordered
first i_want_to say the_service_and staff here were_amazing
my_water_glass never_went less than half_full
kudos
our_waiter was_very_helpful also in helping us decide what to_get
i_would_say he went above and beyond
to start_off
we_tried_the vegetable samosa's and_vegetable pakora's
the samosa's reminded me_of an empanada except stuffed_with potato_and peas
accompanied with the_sauces
these_were great
the pakora's were_good also but_a_little too_much breading
for the_main_course
we_went_with the_chicken_tikka_masala
the_tomato curry_sauce over the_chicken_was good
i scooped this over the_basmati_rice and_was_very pleased
as_for_the chicken_and rice dishes
there_was plenty to_be shared between people and_couldn't imagine eating this all myself
we even_had much leftover
the_garlic_naan came out warm
flavorful_and perfect
overall_i was delighted for_this to_be my_first indian_food experience
my hunny and_i always make_sure_to eat_here on get_away day
good_buffet and_nice clean restaurant
in five years we haven't missed a visit_here yet on_our annual vegas trip
this_place_was a godsend for_a hungry vegan
i_had_the lunch_buffet_and was delighted
highly_recommend to_any vegan visiting the_strip_and looking_for_a real meal
excellent_food
samosa_chaat and aloo_tikki were_some of_the_best ones i_have_had so_far in america
the_food overall was_excellent
i'm_really glad i_decided_to come_here
first_i was skeptical because the_place_was completely empty
not a_single soul was_here
however
a_lot_of_people showed up once_we were sitted
highly_recommend to_any one
tamba_is located_in_a run down shopping_center and_a_little hard_to find but_once_you do
it's soooooo worth_it
we_had_the lunch_buffet_and were blown_away by the_number_of vegetarian_dishes
the southern_indian items_were less than desirable but the_saag
dal
naan
etc
all were_excellent
friendly
attentive_staff too
indian_food on_the_strip
yaya
it_was_like visiting lil india on_the_strip
we reached here when_it_was
pm
yes they_were even letting in people when_it_was pm
the_food_was_just ok
not_spicy to my_indian taste_buds
but yes you_can ask_them to_make_it spicy
delicious_indian_food with great_service_and good ambiance
on_the_strip too
samosa_chaat was_good
we_also_had aloo_gobi and paneer_tikka_masala
will visit_again next_time we're in_vegas
awesome_food service
everything we_tried was_extremely tasty
great_selection_of food_items as_well
i_will absolutely be_back_again
wish_i had known about_it sooner
my absolute favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
hands down
try the_tandoori fish
palak_paneer and_butter_chicken
to_die_for
i_am staying at_a hotel off strip_and so_i tried two off strip indian_restaurants_and tamba on_the_strip
all for_lunch_buffet
food_at tamba was hands_down_the best
even_though_the most expensive
but_not by much
all_vegetarian dishes_were very_flavorful
decor also improved from years_ago when_i last visted them
it_was_also the_only restaurant of_the three where i_saw indian customers
for_what is_worth
this_place_is excellent in_many ways
husband went exploring the_strip while_i of_course slept in
he discovered tamba and brought_me their card knowing that i_love_indian_food
we walked from_the mgm at_about
which_is_a pretty weird scene
the mall is empty except for_this_restaurant
the_restaurant_was about full with more_than of_the people eating_there indian or pakistani
we_ordered on basmati_rice
naans
began bharta and matter_paneer
all excellent
literally the_best roast eggplant curry i_have_ever_had
they roast the_eggplant in their_tandoori oven which adds a smoky flavor
the_texture and heat were just_right
paneer was_perfectly made
the_portions_are more_than twice the_size_of what_i normally get_here in san_francisco bay_area
pricing a_bit higher
but_it_is vegas_and
a_dish is_not unreasonable
waiter_and hostess and bus staff were_all_very nice and_efficient
once_you find_this_place in an_old shopping centre
it's well_worth_it
service_was_great
it_was quiet
meals were lovely
butter_chicken a_little different_from the aussie butter_chicken but_still nice
meals were large as i_ordered_a number to_share but_there_was so_much left_over
very_nice
love_this_place
so cute
so modern
food portions_are huge
can't_wait_to go_back
butter_chicken_is delicious
a_hidden oasis
all_i wanted after walking endlessly up_and down the_strip was to_find_a reasonably_priced restaurant that_was quiet
this_was it
strangely placed on the_second level_of a nearly empty strip_mall along the_strip
you_might not_know it_was there
beautiful inside with soft indian music_playing
this_was_a place i_could forget that_i_was in_las_vegas_and enjoy delicious curry
i_shared_the goat_curry with_my_husband since the_serving size easily serves reasonable appetites along_with rice_and_naan
the_naan_bread_was delicious
the_curry had_a_nice light spice_and was_probably a_bit too_salty
but_i_still loved_it
the lime ginger soda was unexpectedly tasty too
i could_see going back here_a_few more_times if_i_were stuck here longer
the_waitstaff was_attentive too
though_there weren't many diners
okay
this_isn't a_place_i would typically give_stars
but it_was_just what_i needed at_the_time
one request draft beer would_be_a good addition_to_the menu
we_loved tamba
we love_indian_food_and are_vegetarian
but don't_have an_indian_restaurant_in our town
so when_we travel we_usually go indian
we've been out_in paris
london
san_francisco and tamba was_as_good as_all our favorites
we'd never_had samosas chaat which_was exquisite
samosas with special toppings
we_have two boys
and
and_all four of_us_were trying_to plan how to_go_back when we_could on_our stay here
we had_dinner one_night
ordered_off menu
and buffet two_days later for_lunch both_times it_was_awesome
lunch_is less expensive of_course
we_tried several new_dishes in_the_buffet and_we_all loved everything
we lamented our shows all started at_pm_and they_didn't open until_pm for_dinner
but we_found a_way to_get there_for_lunch
the_service_was outstanding a super classy place tucked_away in_an odd little location
well_worth searching it_out
my_friends_and_i were walking down the_strip really hungry_and we_had_no idea_what to_get until we_saw tamba
the_restaurant is_kind_of hidden_in a shopping_center
but_i'm glad_we found_it
great_service_and great_food
i_got_the buttered chicken_with rice_and_garlic pita_bread soo good
this_place_is_amazing
food_is_great and good_value too
if_you_are looking_for comforting food_with cozy setting
its far_from busy street
navratan korma was_great_and nan_was much better_than other_places
i_was_pleasantly_surprised by tamba indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
being_indian
i_feel_like i_am slightly harsher than the_average individual when_it_comes_to judging indian_food
tamba_is situated conveniently near_the middle mid south area of_the_strip
the_restaurant_was clean and_had_a very_pleasant ambiance that_is_a fusion of modern_and traditional elements
the_staff_was_very_friendly and_attentive to_us during our_meal
the_buffet itself was_quite_good
there_was a_variety_of options_for vegetarians_and non vegetarians
the_food_quality was surprisingly_good and_there_were a_number_of healthy options
the_buffet_was pretty reasonably_priced for las_vegas about person including tax
tamba_is definitely one_of_the_better indian_buffets that i_have_been_to and i_look_forward_to returning
we_went_on_a sunday and_they_were only doing a_buffet
that turned_out really_well
since i_wanted_to_try different_things and not_be stuck with a_single entr_e
the_food_was_excellent
and_flavorful
the_wait_staff_was on_their toes
someone was_right there to_pick_up the_plate when_we_were done_with it_and refilled water the minute you put_the empty glass down
looking_forward_to going again soon
very customer friendly_and generally good people
but one_of_our guests threw up an_hour after eating_here
won't be_coming back
but_i wish them the_best
not a_good_experience
food_is too oily
very less non vegetarian_options
no taste what so ever in_any of our_food
we_ordered different kinds_of
shaak
n all of_them tasteless
even the_customer_service was_bad
we had_to_ask_for water or time
no_one even come to_ask how was the_food
very_disappointed
call before_you go_for_dinner to_see_if they_actually serving
dinner
i_arrived for_dinner to_be told_that it_was_only a_buffet
the_wait_staff_was unsure 'when' or 'if' it will_ever return_to a regular_menu for_dinner
the_buffet table_was too short for the_number_of people seated in_the_restaurant
the_line was_almost out the_front door to_get food
as for_the_food mediocre
food seems_to lose its quality when plopped into_a gallon pan
the nan_bread was_dry and_some_of it_was burnt
hopefully the_food would_be much better served as_a dinner
when_i_am with_a_group_of people
they_always prefer to_pick tamba for_indian_food
can't complain
good_indian_food will put you_in a_good mood
very mediocre indian_food
naans_were cold
currys that these_guys serve are cheapest and_most commonly available in_all indian_restaurants
for_this you_will_be paying ridiculously high price
please improve your_food and menu
this_was decent_indian_food
it_was especially welcoming in_las_vegas where_it seems_like you_pay out_the nose for mediocre food
so_they would_get
we_ordered_a sampler platter
garlic_naan
chicken_tandoori and fish masala
the_chicken and_garlic_naan_were very_nice
the platter was_also tasty for a_group appetizer
ask_for kumar he's a sarcastic waiter who may make_you laugh
check_in and you_may get_a off food coupon_for lunch_or_dinner
the_decor_is also quite_nice
very calm dinner environment
it also_had several indian families as customers
which seemed_like_a great sign to_me
we_ordered_a bottle_of cabernet wine_and it_was_about per_person not bad_for the_strip
we_went_here last_week for_a friend's going away party
it_is_a small
southern_indian vegetarian restaurant just north of_the on scottsdale rd
the_dosas for appetizers_were tasty_and very_filling
and the_entree
gobi_manchurian
was_amazing i_never thought cauliflower could taste so_good
we_also_had_the bhatura bread
which_was_a large
light bread_that could_easily be shared between people
the_food_is also served family_style
so_it_is easy_to try multiple things and_share with others
as_a_vegetarian
i_can't think_of the_last_time_i had so_many choices
we_will_definitely_be_back
update
i_have relocated to the_bay_area and_still haven't_had indian_food_this good_in san_francisco or berkeley
damn
pierre's review_of the_health code violations brought this from_a five to_a one
ick ick ick ick ick
southern style indian_food all vegetarian_and_vegan
after having a_few games of buckhunt at_the stray cat
and perhaps a pitcher of miller high life
i_won't front
my_companion and_i_decided we_were hungry
not wanting_to resort to four peaks in_tempe for_food
he_suggested green restaurant finally
a flexatarian
def
someone who enjoys not eating meat at every meal_and understands that a_person may_not eat meat and_still like food
who understood my lactose intolerance wasn't just to_be difficult
so we_stopped by green
and_they_are closed on sundays
damn
we drive down scottsdale road
saddened by_the rainy sunday_night
and_he spots this_indian_restaurant
i pictures creamy paneers and chickeny kormas
uh uh folks
all vegetarian_and_vegan
we_are welcomed warmly to a_full house and realize quickly we_are the_only white people there
score
i_order us the_appetizer sampler which is_huge
i_mean
it_had four sauces
the cilantro
coconut
tamarind
and some_kind_of chutney
pakoras
samosas
lentils
etc
we_ended_up cutting them_all in half and taking them home
i_had_the dosai with potatos
onions
chutney
peas and_spices and_loved_it
i_love tamarind_sauce and_i_think the_staff_was please i_did cause they_give me_a shitload
he ordered_a kind of dosai with cheese in_it and_it_tasted yummy
but eerily like_an enchilda
i_also convinced him_to indulge in the_mango_lassi
god
i_miss those dairy yogurty drinks
and_it_was tasty not_that sweet_and maybe a_bit yogurty than necessary
but_really cooled down_the mouth when had too_much of_the spicy chutney
the_bathroom was_nice
the_staff_was great
the_decor_was simply
all_the_indian families were_happy
i_was_happy
he_was happy
and_i_had about vegan items to_choose_from
why the_hell did_i wait so_long to_go_here
please check_it_out
i_have dreams about the_potato onion pancakes here
i_love udupi
all_vegetarian and a_healthy understanding of 'vegan'
the helpful waitstaff carefully made_sure i didn't_eat the_wrong sauce when dining with_friends
their pancakes are_huge
actually much bigger than_the filling inside
and_there_is_a large selection_of_food to_choose_from
the food_was_ok
buffet_style
what really left a_bad taste in_my_mouth was
a
having my complete credit_card number left on_the receipt
b
getting hit with_a phone call charge to_my credit_card
when_i called my bank to investigate
it turns out somebody had charged a phone call from london to_india on_my credit_card
c
it turns out it_was somebody from this_restaurant
stay away from_this shady place
there_are_plenty_of other honest indian_food businesses in_the metro phoenix_area
delicious lunch_buffet_with great_naan and_vegetarian
sometimes vegan
dishes
you definitely won't miss meat
their dosai are_wonderful
with or without the_masala filling
dunk them in_some tomato chutney for_some spicy nummyness
i've_had their_lunch_buffet here_for months_and it_only rarely gets old
they often serve cauliflower dishes for_lunch
but they're accompanied by at least other_dishes for_you to_choose_from
i_have_yet_to visit here_for_dinner
sadly
the food_is_so_good
the_menu_is huge so i_always_get_the sample platter thing because_i can never decide on one_thing
or
i_go_there at_lunch time to_get_the buffet
the_buffet_is always different every_time_i go
and
its vegetarian_vegan
so its always an option_for the_veg heads
i_love_this_place despite_the violations that_it received last year
i heard_about it_from a_friend_who lived in_india for awhile and_she said
eh
it makes_it more_authentic
and seriously
what restaurant in_phoenix doesn't_have roaches
as long_as i_don't_see them while i'm dining i_don't_care
and
it's still open
so_i assume that_they_have rectified the situation
if_you_like south_indian this_is_the_place
for_those of_you who_are worried about the_bad health dept rating from last year they fixed their problems and_have had_all inspections rated gold or silver since then
most recent

gov environmental services website
the_lunch_buffet_is great delicious south_indian vegetarian cuisine
dinner is_fantastic
too
one_of_the best south_indian places i_have_been_to including in_nyc and california
fiancee unit who_has been_to tamil nadu state in_india says the_food_is_very authentic
i_love reading others reviews about_my favorite_restaurants
regardless of_the nasty health reports which have since been taken_care of
this_is_the_best southern_indian food have_ever_had
the_lunch_buffet is_always_good
there_is this cauliflower dish on_the_menu_that is_so friggin good
i_wish_i_could remember the_name
everything_i have put in_my_mouth here_as been worth telling about
if_you_don't need meat at every meal like_most americans think they_do then try_it
i_love_it when_i_go into any ethnic restaurant and_see more_people of_that particular ethnicity than your run of_the mill american
to_me it_is a_good_sign of an_authentic food_experience
i'm_going_to marry the_gobi_manchurian
kids will follow
this food_is_so_good it_would throw my principles to_the ground
but_it's all_vegetarian and_most_of the_menu_is vegan
thank_you udupi for_your wonderful oily menu
yeah
it's_not super healthy
but amazing anyway
this is_my_favorite_indian_restaurant anywhere
last summer i_was_in_the pittsburgh area visiting a_friend_of_mine that_is from_india
he_took me_to what_he said was_the_best and most_authentic indian_food_in_the country
udupi is_better
the_environment leaves much to_be_desired
but the_food_is_amazing
a must_have is_the paper dosai masala
it's a_huge crispy crepe that_has a filling
the_masala has_a potato filling
and it_comes_with sambar and chutney to_dip it_in
the presentation is_as wonderful as the_flavor
as evidence
the_last_time_i ordered_it
the_tables on either side of_us asked what_it_was
the pricing could be_a_little cheaper at_dinner
i_have_yet_to make_it to_the_lunch_buffet so_i'm_not sure_how it compares
all in_all
if you're looking_for great_indian_food
this_is_the_place_to be
i_thought_this place would_be shut down by the_health department by now
this used_to_be my_favorite_indian_restaurant
no matter if_it's vegetarian
until it_had_a string of health inspections and violations that threatened to_close its doors almost every two months last year
seriously
i_thought_it_was hanging by_a fingernail a_few_months ago
but judging from_the recent dated reviews
it's still open
i_don't_know_if i_should celebrate or be_a_little worried
i_try to_check restaurants' stats by using maricopa
gov's link
and i_couldn't get myself to_dine there a_few_weeks_ago as udupi still does not have_a_good report
but then_again
most_of_the indian_places_i like didn't either
only royal taj consistently gets golds
i do_love the_dosas here
simply the_best resto for dosa
the_gobi_manchurian is_quite a_dish
love the_app sampler
their palak_paneer is the_best_i've_had in_the_valley
this could_easily be my_favorite of all_indian venues
but the_owners cooks seriously need_to heed health inspection reports
and_so do the_customers
come_on now
how hard is_it to_take_the time_to wash your hands before_you continue preparing food_after you come_in from dumping trash in_the garbage bin
we consumers can help keep these restaurants efficient and_their kitchens clean
which translates to_our digestive systems uncompromised
by voting with_our wallets
as_soon as udupi gets a_great health report
i_will_be_back to_enjoy its menu
before_i go into details about today's experience_at udupi
i_want_to attest that_the_food i_had tasted wonderful
my_friend_and_i agreed to_meet for_lunch
i was_the_first to_arrive by at least ten_minutes
this gave_me ample time_to survey the_buffet_and ask the_host questions concerning my_food allergies
however
before_i started_with_the allergy questions
i inquired if the_buffet came_with dosa
the_host said yes
we_would later find_out
during check out
that
buffet dosa
cost an_additional
so
the correct answer would_be no
after_all of_my questions had_been answered
i concluded that only the_white basmati_rice
bread
plain paratha and iddly
four_of six chutneys
homemade papadum
and_dessert
homemade cottage_cheese balls
think non fried gulab_jamun
soaked in sweetened coconut milk sprinkled with crushed pistachios and_other spices
were allergen free
i'm_not much of_a
chips and dips
person
unless spinach
artichoke
garlic
and_cheese and_a_few whole_wheat crostini are involved
so_my prospects concerning the_buffet looked pretty grim
while attempting to_place a phone call and_i wondering out loud if i_should_have my_friend meet me elsewhere
i spied a_dish containing one dosa sitting_on my_table
the_host overheard my asking my_friend if_he was_going_to have_the_buffet
yes
that_was his intention
and_i then asked the_host that rather i_have my_friend meet me elsewhere
which meant that the_dosa would_have_to be thrown away
could he have_the_buffet and dosa
and_i_could order_something off_the_menu
yes was_the answer
before_i even looked at_the_menu
i_ordered_the palak_paneer with_rice
he quickly turned in my_order
and_i proceeded_to take a_couple_of bites of_the now cooled dosa
the_host suddenly did_a and returned to my_table to_tell me_that i_couldn't share my friend's buffet_or else he would_have_to charge me for_another buffet
i_said that_i_was only having the_cold dosa
which_he would_have_to throw away had i_decided_to leave
and_he_said that_it_was against restaurant policy for_two_people to_share the_buffet
i_said i understood
that i_wasn't intending to_share my friend's buffet entree
but that_i_was only having the_cold dosa_which my_friend would_probably prefer to_be hot_and_fresh
i_made a mental note not_to come_back_here anymore
or_at least
not to_come_back anytime soon
i_also thought i_should_have gone with the_idea_of going somewhere_else
friend finally arrived
grabbed some buffet_items
and_sat down to_eat
it_took about_minutes for_my palak_paneer
spinach
homemade cottage_cheese cubes
onions
spices
and_coconut curry
entree to_arrive
but the_wait was_definitely worth_it the_spinach leaves had_a beautiful dark green color to_it and weren't at_all mushy
the cubes_of cheese were meaty on_the_outside and_creamy on_the_inside
and the_onions
cubed chilies
and_spinach stems and_other spices perfected the masterpiece
i_can eat_this over rice_or stuff it into dosa or pita_bread and_be blissful
it's_good to_know that_the_food served here_is delectable
it must_be said
however
that_other than_the news that_the venue has_been under new_management for over_a_year now
i_would_not have been_able_to surmise anything had changed at_all invariant furniture and_decor
consistent and scrumptious food
same cooks in place
and familiar faces among the_staff
even the_same hosts manning the_door and register
i_wish_the new_management sustained success
i_have_had udupi bookmarked for_about three months_and i_cannot believe it_took_me this long to_make_it over here
especially since it_is less than seven minutes_from my apartment
i had_dinner plans with_an out_of_town friend and_he mentioned being in_the_mood for_indian
the stars aligned and we_ended_up here
i_started out_with_a hot black tea_and mixed vegetable_pakora as our_appetizer
the deep_fried potatoes_and veggies came_with two awesome sauces
one reminded me_of a_sauce with_a_little sweet tang
the_waiter was_extremely_friendly and_did_not take offense to_our slaughtering of the_names_of the menu_items
he even made_a bread suggestion and explained what each_of_the sauces_were made_of
we_opted to_go_with the batura bread
which happens to_be_a giant deep_fried poof of bread_that tastes_like a sopapilla
it actually looked_like a giant jellyfish when it_came to_the_table
as an_entree we_went_with my_personal fav
mutter_paneer
which_was excellent
and udupi special spring dosai
basically thin crepe chutney spring roll type things
they_were_good
but not_great
our food_came_out quickly
the service_was_attentive
the_prices_were reasonable_and i_was_really impressed_with_the taste
portions and_quality_of our_dishes
i_will_be_back to udupi for_sure
this_place_is_amazing
wicked tasty
friendly_service
i_really appreciate knowing that_there_is absolutely zero chance of finding meat_in my_food
as this_is_a fully vegetarian restaurant
some stuff does have dairy in_it
but the_menu_is full_of vegan_dishes and makes_it pretty clear
the_chana batura is_my current favorite
chick_peas and giant puffy bread
i_absolutely_love this_place
first of_all
i_am not_a_fan_of buffets
usually you_get_a selection_of questionable choices over cooked slop
udupi_cafe does the traditional_indian buffet_lunch perfectly
at least on_weekends holidays
the_week day lunch is_a_little disappointing
not in_quality but_in variety
the_weekend holiday lunch_buffet_is full_of variety
being vegetarian
its nice_to have_a_buffet full_of tasty options without worry
the majority_of dishes_are vegan clearly marked
everything_is tasty well_seasoned
you wont find any tandoori options here
so_no naan
but
the dosa_is absolutely_delicious don't hesitate to_ask_for more
i_have even witnessed a foot long dosa being_served to a_family
so bring_your
friends maybe get lucky
this_was my_first_experience with_indian_food
as_a side note
i_would_recommend that you_don't try something completely new for_the_first_time by yourself
that's_what i_did so_i_was the single guy in the_corner looking_at everyone watching what they_took from_the_buffet
how_they ate it
etc
they thought i_was weird
the_restaurant_itself was_nice good parking right_up front
i got_there right at noon and_it_wasn't busy
the_hostess was_very_friendly_and the_staff prompt_and friendly
as for_the_food
i can't_really tell you_what i_had
but it_was_good
i_had_a soup
and_tried a_little_of each of_the_dishes on_the_buffet
they_brought_out something and_sat on_the_table
it_was_a crispy thing with something inside
i watched for others to_eat theirs and joined in
it_was_pretty_good
i_would_definitely_go back
but hopefully with someone that knows something about_the_food
great_buffet
although_it_was a_little_on_the salty side
i'll be_going back_there the_first chance i_get
which unfortunately won't be soon enough as_i live_in oregon
everything_was so_yummy
and all_vegetarian
a_surprise to_my father who naively asked_for lamb
he_was_very satisfied
nonetheless
in_the_end
udupi_cafe is_my_new favorite_indian_restaurant_in phoenix
wonderful spices
intense flavor spectrum
and genuine homemade flavor will satisfy any eater
carnivore or vegan
i dined with_a_group_of friends late on_a_friday evening
opting for adventure
most_of us_ordered blindly from_the extensive all vegetarian_menu
selecting whatever
sounded good
there_are tons_of vegan_options as_well
i_ordered palek paneer
my_indian_food barometer
it_was_spicy
fresh
and filled_with cubes_of paneer
the_house specialty vegetable manchurian are meatball sized chunks_of crispy deliciousness dripping with sweet chili_sauce
they reminded me_of a_spicy crispy honey chicken
but vegan
the dosai
crepes
my_friends ordered were huge flavorful pockets filled_with spicy veggies
the light pillows of paratha
bread
reminded me_of sopapillas
chili pakora appetizers_were insanely delicious
an_indian pepper popper
a_definite
gotta try_it
for_any fan of_spicy
fantastic_service
water_glasses_were kept full
waiters_were attentive
and_the_food_was served piping_hot_and quickly
even for_our large_party
i_will_definitely return to_satisfy my_new craving_for palek paneer vegetable manchurian
and to_try_something_new
okay
so i_love_this_place too
indian_food_is possibly my_favorite cuisine
i_was_in tempe for a_few_days
and_my vegetarian self always struggles out_on_the highway
seeking the_best experiences i can_have
and_always fearful of_going hungry
well
at
pm friday_night
i accidented upon this_place
in_a goofy strip_mall next_to a motel
and nervously asked if_it_was too late to_dine since they_were closing at pm
the_owner_was very welcoming_and seated_us promptly
the_place_was a bland sun drenched pink walled space with_a buffet_at the_back wall
i_didn't_have much hope at_all
but_when our palak_paneer and_our bharwan baigan curry showed up
the salivating began
perfectly prepared
the_eggplant was_absolutely delectable
the_spinach and_cheese also very_delicious
i_couldn't beleive it
this_was_a definite rival to_my fave indian kitchen back_home
i_loved_it
we_had_some leftovers
but_no rice to_go_with it
so the_owner gave us free rice so_we_could have our curries for breakfast in_the a
m
a_definite must if_you_like true indian vegetarian_food
tempe has it's indian going_on
udupi is_by_far_the_best_indian food_in_town
it_is all_vegetarian and_has many vegan_options that_are scrumptious
my_favorite night_out involves chili gobi
breaded cauliflower in spicy red sauce
and chana batura
saucy chick_peas with giant puffy bread
so_so good
their_buffet_is good_too but_i prefer going_for dinner
udupi is one_of_the_best_indian_restaurants that_i've ever_been_to
and i've_been_to a_lot
the_gobi_manchurian
noted by several prior reviewers
and_the chole peshwari are to_die_for
i_also recommend their sunday brunch even_though_it costs more_than ordering off their_menu
the_only_downside to udupi is_that_it received some bad press for_the cleanliness of_their kitchen_and dining_room
i_must admit that_i saw_a cockroach once at udupi but
this_was a_year_ago and_they seem_to_have cleaned up their act
nonetheless
the_food_is_amazing
well_priced
and offers_a welcome treat to a_veggie lover's tummy
thanks_to an episode of
roker on the_road
i_had a_craving_for dosa
after_a day_of going back_and forth of
udupi_cafe or taj_mahal
i decided_on giving udupi_cafe another try
after poring over the_dosa menu
i_finally decided_on the udupi special spring dosa
a version i_haven't_tried here_before
i_asked my servers if the_dosa and_the chutneys_were free of certain allergenic ingredients_and was_told
with authority i_might add
that the_dosa_was ok and_while two_of three chutneys
coconut and jalapeno cilantro
were off limits
the_sambar is_good to_go
he even pointed out an allergen ingredient in_the coconut_chutney
the a_ok signal on the_sambar surprised me greatly
as out_of_the three choices
it_was_the first item i'd_have balked at trying
i've tried_it at many_other restaurants_and was_told that_the recipe calls for_a_few allergens
my_server did offer to_bring tamarind_sauce to replace the_other two chutneys
since_i_was almost salivating at_the sight of the_dosa and_the_server was_pretty confident in_his knowledge of_chutney ingredients
i dove my spoon into the_sambar and_came up_with_a lovely and_flavorful chunk of_potato and a_bit_of broth
yum
i_went_in again
this_time swirling a_bit to_make_sure there weren't any allergens hiding in_the murky depths when_i spotted
as_if on cue
my_server and the_host approach my_table to_tell me_that i_should not_eat the_sambar nor the_dosa since_they contained allergens
argh
so
away went my udupi special spring dosa
away went the_sambar
and_i_was back_to square one as_to what_to_order
although this_time i_knew_i had_a_few hours of pain and nausea to look_forward_to
which started_to rear their ugly heads as_i_was signing my credit_card receipt
at_this_point
the_host was steering me away_from_the dosa menu since i'd_have to_stay away from all_that contained any filling
apparently
the_kitchen staff could_not whip up_a filling that omitted the_one ingredient that kept me_from having it
under normal circumstances
this wouldn't_be such_a terrible thing as there_are many_other dosa options that_would then be complemented with chutneys
but_since the_three chutneys also contained an ingredient i_couldn't have
again
the_chef would_not be_able_to make the_sauces omitting the ingredient the_host explained that_the chutneys_were made in huge batches earlier in_the day
dosa from udupi_cafe is_off limits for_me
i_decided
then
to_have_the assorted appetizer platter
this would've only_been accompanied by tamarind_sauce had i not asked_for_a second option
plain yogurt
as suggested by the_host
plain yogurt
i_asked
could you add something else to flavor the_yogurt
carrots
is carrots ok
the_host posited
yes
carrots are alright
i_said
the_three items_i savored in the_app platter were cauliflower pakora
the_samosa
and the_veggie cutlet
i_wasn't a_fan_of the dense mysore bonda
various fillings of_potato
eggplant
and jalapeno
nor the bready medhu vada
fried lentil donuts
although the_latter was_quite_good dipped in tamarind_sauce and_yogurt
in retrospect
i_did_not particularly revel in_the recurring reminders of_how everything_was deep_fried
in light of_the disinclination of udupi_cafe to omit certain ingredients in_their dishes_which leads me_to believe_that most items_are already pre made_and later plated
if you read my other_reviews
you'll see just how_many chefs are_quite willing to swap out sub sauces
sometimes piqued at the_chance_to come up_with_a new sauce on_the fly
and_the the reluctance in creating a_simple chutney
i_doubt i'll keep uc at the_top_of my choices next_time i_have_a taste for_indian_cuisine
so_many fish in_the sea
i_wish uc and_its management and_staff well in providing vegetarians_and omnivores alike the_opportunity to_enjoy a_menu offering up veggie fare
do try the_gobi_manchurian very_tasty
at least the_meal wasn't a_total loss i_did get_to capture some captivating eye candy
how i_wish_i_had a close up_on that veggie cutlet
and_that samosa
one_of_the best restaurants for southern_indian fare in_phoenix with_a traditional
sit down dining atmosphere
good_lunch_buffet
especially on_weekends with_more options to_choose_from
service_is inconsistent
sometimes they're understaffed
cleanliness has_been a concern at_this_place in_the_past
and_even now_the restrooms are_still to_be avoided
i read_the_reviews here_at yelp agree_with most_of you
this_is_one_of_the_best south_indian restaurants outside india
the buffet_is_great
not_greasy like a_lot_of other_indian_restaurants
typical taste_of south_india
i_saw some reviews about_the_place being unhygeinic
it_is as clean as it_gets
it's possible it_was_not so clean earlier
the_service_was_pretty decent
considering there_was_only one_person serving
they_could hire couple_of waiters to_make_the service better
my_family really_enjoyed_it
my_son was apprehensive with it_being completely vegetarian
but_even he ate heartily
it_was_a_nice mother's day buffet
i went_on_a wednesay with_a collegue visitng from_india that_was craving hojmetown food
little selection_and way_to salty
some dishes_were tasy and_i appreciate_the all veginess
but_was dissapointed
udupi saved my dupa
i_had_to have_an event catered and_the_place i planned on using could_not accomodate our time
i_needed food_at noon
they_didn't open till pm
shame on_me for_not checking
but_hey we live_in a_big city
never thought about_it
i frantically went_to yelp to_find an alternate
all_of_the_food needed to_be vegetarian
i'm_not vegetarian
had_no clue where to_get good_food_and fast
found great reviews_on_yelp so_i gave udupi a_try
one phone call and_they_had an entire catered buffet menu worked out
in_my price range
they_were completely accommodating and the_food_was_fantastic
i_asked them_for mild spice and_that's exactly what_we_got
everyone raved about_the_food
the_special house curry_was especially tasty
i_will_be_back and can't_wait_to try other_dishes
i_will_never know what_the food_tastes like because_they_were so_so rude
i_will_not go_back
we_came_in and were_given a_table
menus were practically thrown at_us
and_then we_waited
and_waited and_waited
we_asked a woman working_there
and_she apparently did_not speak english and indicated a man at_the_front would help us
but_he was too_busy talking
we got_up and_left
no_one even said a_word when_we_left
so
i_have_been giving vegetarianism a_shot the_past couple weeks
pescetarian may_be_a better word
but_that_is neither here nor there
i_was invited to join amber w's vegeversary on friday_night and_this_was the_spot she picked
i_will admit
i_was_a_little scared by the_veggie vegan only at an_indian_place
being the_good yelper i_am i_decided a_new place_to review would_be enough of_a draw
kidding amber
i_arrived a_little late and the_table had already ordered
but the_server came_by with_a menu and_i
along_with my_brother and a_friend
were_able_to order rather quickly
the_table had ordered_some apps of cauliflower manchurian and batura
which_is_a large puffy bread
the_cauliflower was_great_and_the bread reminded me_of_the skin goldmember eats in_the austin powers movie
but_it tasted_great
my_brother and_i_ordered_the vegetables manchurian and the_onion and_hot chili uthappam
the_veggies were mashed together into_a ball and_then sauteed
very_good with a_little_bit_of a_kick to_them
the uthappam was_a giant pancake with_onions and_other spices
it_was_really_good and_i_could have_eaten the_whole thing myself
it reminded me of_a potato latke
we_shared other_dishes at_the_table with everyone else
there_was_a pretty wide_variety_of dishes
some_kind_of spinach
a_dish with_peas and_paneer
awesome
btw
and couple_of others that i_wouldn't begin to_find on_the_menu without help
rice_is brought out_with all_of_the dishes and_it_was cooked_perfectly
we divied up the_bill and_it_was_very affordable for_the_amount_of_food we_all got to_eat
the_place will_not be_a staple on_my regular rotation
but_if someone says that_is where_we are meeting for_dinner
there won't be any hesitation going back
minus one star_for_the sub arctic temps where_i was sitting
udupi used_to_be better a_couple_of years_ago
i'm pretty_sure ownership changed and_it_is not_as_good any more
i_agree_with the_other user that the_lunch_buffet does not seem fresh_and often cold during peak lunch_hour
the bread_is fresh_and_hot and_service_is good_as_well
i_haven't_tried many_items or the_lunch_buffet yet
but from whatever i've_had here
i_would_say its a_decent option for_indian_food
being a_vegetarian
its a_nice thing to_know that_there_is no chance of_meat ending up_in my_food
vegetarian_vegan south_indian buffet
guilt free conscience
what more could a girl want
i_am in_love_with the_dosas
i_always wish i_had_a larger tummy to_accommodate all_the delicious_food
udupi is proof that_being vegan vegetarian can_be tasty_and cruelty free
humble ambiance
no fancy decorations
although i_am_not_a vegan vegetarian
i_really_enjoyed udupi_cafe
having the_sampler plate_and appetizers including iddly
it_was_definitely unlike any food_i've_ever_had
with_a stress on mixing varieties_of different flavors_and textures
hoping to_make_it to southern india sometime in the_next couple years_and udupi has given me another reason_to look_forward_to it
ok so_it's star since_i can't_go any lower
one_of_the worst indian_food experiences i_have_had in_the_us
the_service would was_horrible and_the_owner just downright rude
i_went_there for_a_lunch with_a_couple_of friends_and was informed rather rudely that they_only have_a buffet_for_lunch
this was_disappointing since_i had my_heart set on certain traditional dishes some_of which_were part_of_the buffet already
the_owner couldn't seem_to care less whether we stayed or left and_pretty much seemed_to give us an ultimatum to either eat_the buffet_or leave
it_being late we_decided_to_try the_buffet_was sub par
barely an item i_could think_of going_back_for
in_short avoid it if_you_can
the_service makes its_not worth_it
so here's the_deal
i_love_indian_food
i grew up_with easy access to some_great examples of_it growing up
partly due_to my friends' parents
but_since moving_to arizona a_few_years back
it's_been difficult finding good places_for some indian_cuisine
a_few_months back
i_was driving down scottsdale road and a_sign caught my eye
vegetarian
i later discovered that_it_was an_indian_restaurant_that was held in pretty high regard from a_few_of my_friends_and_i knew that_i_had to_give_it go
i've now been_to udupi_cafe for_lunch a_few_times
pretty much the_only_thing_that i_would change would_be it's location to central phoenix so_i_could eat_there more often
udupi's lunch_buffet_is awesome
especially for_less_than
it_has a_good_selection_of flavorful dishes
most_of which_are actually vegan
the_usual favorites_are in attendance
a_variety_of chutneys
dhal
paratha
etc
as_well_as_a few_dishes that_are a_little_more particular to udupi
the lemon_rice is_great
in_addition_to the selections at_the_buffet
you_are also served an_amazing curried potato filled dosa with_your_meal
for_those of_you unfamiliar with dosai
they_are the_indian equivalent of_a french crepe that's made_from rice
not_that i'm one_of_them
but they're also_great for_people that_are trying_to be gluten_free
the filling aside
which_is tasty though nothing super special
the_actual dosa crepe at udupi is_one the_best that_i've ever_had in_phoenix or elsewhere
awesome texture_and flavor
although i_can_only comment on their_lunch_buffet
i_would imagine that the_rest_of their_food would only be_better
bottom_line
a_great_place_for indian_food in_the_phoenix metro area
the_best that i've_had so_far
i_found udupi in_the strangest way
i_was talking with my_friend from ne mesa
and_she told_me i_was right_next_to her favorite_indian_restaurant
i_thought_it_was ironic that i_have_been driving by it for_a_couple months_and thought_it_was part_of_the laundry mat
little did_i know
it_was_a_little piece_of food heaven
the_atmosphere_is less than desirable
but_the_food_is fantastic
the_entire menu_is vegetarian_and i_cannot recommend one_thing
because_it_is all excellent
they_do_not serve alcohol
but_you_can bring_your_own bottle and they_don't make_you pay_a cork fee
i_recommend going with_a_group
this allows you to_order multiple items_and try_them family_style
it's_so hard doing vegetarian_and dining out in_arizona
of_this i'm_sure
we've been_to udupi a_few_times over the_past few_months
and taken my mother when_she was visiting and my_sister for_her birthday
i_was nervous the_first_time from reading a_bad review
here plus
it's_in kind of_a not appetizing location
that_said
everything_was_great
service_is gracious and professional
the_atmosphere_is a_tad 'old denny's' but the_other diners are_usually a cross section_of people that you_could probably_be stuck on_an island with and_no_one would eat you
random i_know
but_this_one time_we_were_there and_this cool young couple had_a baby and friends at_their table_and you_could just tell they were_all_very loving people
sorry for_the woo woo
the_place smells good
and the_food_is_fresh_and authentic
i_love_the paper masala_dosai and_now i'm craving one before am
love_love love
this_place_is_a vegan indian_food lover's dream come true
it_is almost totally vegan with only a_couple_of exceptions the_desserts are never vegan
but_it's genuine south_indian
so what can you_do
the_food_here_is amazing
amazing
the_lunch_buffet has such_a_great variety_and everything tastes good
i_wish_they had even_more dosa varieties than they_do
when_you drive_by
it_doesn't look_like much
ignore that
looks are_definitely deceiving in_this case
udupi is one_of_our very favorite_restaurants
best_indian_food ever
i_lived_in nyc for_a_while and_couldn't find anything quite as_good as udupi
great_prices
hubby_and_i can_get out_of there for_under bill
the_aloo_gobi is_perfect and i_love_their assorted appetizer platter
fried goodness
the staff_is_very_friendly
i've done the_lunch_buffet
too
which_is fun and great_for mixing it_up if you_find yourself ordering the_same_thing every_time
only
took a_group_of work friends
even some hardcore meat_eaters
and_everyone left happy_and full
went_here_for lunch
it_was_a_good place
but_there_is no meat
so_if that what_you are_looking_for
you_should go elsewhere
i_gave it an a_ok
wasn't my_favorite_place
but it_wasn't_bad
lots_of spicy_food
so be_careful
i'm_sure i_will_be feeling it later tonight
the help was_very_attentive and_they continued to_fill your water_glass
which_is_great
because my_mouth is_still a_little_bit on fire
i_walked_in and_it_was much smaller than_i_expected it_to_be
the_buffet wasn't too_much to_look_at but man the_food_is freakin bomb
they_were even passing out free little fresh extras
honestly the dude that_said this_was spicy is_a wimp
cause i barely felt any kinda fire in_my_mouth
i_left full_and happy
thumbs_up
ill be_back
note they_had vegan dessert when_i_was there
being south_indian myself
i_really really_want to_see south_indian restaurants succeed in_the_valley
and being_a life long vegetarian i_really want_to see such restaurants continue
this_was_my_first_time at udupi
and_can honestly say i_went_in with high expectations
and_left wanting never to_go_back
we_got_there at
and_i_asked the_host
if_it_was too late to_enjoy the_buffet_and if_we should order from_the_menu or take the_buffet he insisted the_buffet would_be wonderful
i_mentioned that this_was_our first_time_here and_asked if_there_was anything special we should try
he said the_buffet_is wonderful_and that while_they close the buffet_at
we should feel free to_enjoy our_lunch after
everything looked appetizing so_we loaded our_plates and_sat down
the_waiter_brought out two dosa's for_us and_everything had_the makings of_a good_lunch
big problem
sadly
the_food_was cold
even the_dosa they supposedly freshly made was_cold not_just the crepe on_the_outside
which_would naturally cool quickly
but_the filling inside as_well
i_mentioned the_cold food_to the_waiter and_he actually grinned and walked away
maybe he_didn't hear me
who knows
big problem
our host didn't tell us_that it_wasn't just_the buffet_that closed at
but the_restaurant_itself
our_waiter actually changed his clothes and_left without even telling us
i_looked around_for him
and the_host came_over_and asked_us
what are_you searching_for
and_i mentioned our_waiter and_he goes
oh he went home
we are_closed right_now
we_are all just waiting_for you so_we can_also go
so of_course
we dropped our forks mid bite got_up and_left per_person
when_i mentioned the_cold food
the_host said_that the_food_is cold because_they turned off their_food warmers over half an_hour ago
um
thanks_for the heads up
you_know
i_could forgive the gaps in service if the_food_was stellar
but_it_was eh
with the_exception of the_spinach kootu dish_with was_delicious
i_went up_to_the condiment bar and_when_i moved a ladle a_bunch_of fruit flies came out_of_the salad area yuck
why would anyone with_any amount of self respect serve a guest food_they new was_cold sub par and_then hurry them_out of_there
if_he had_just said hey we close completely in mins
please join us for_dinner i_absolutely would_have come_back
greedy greedy greedy
i sincerely hope my_experience is_an isolated incident
but_i'll never_go_back
not will_i ever suggest them to_anyone
this_place_is for_your vegetarian_vegan i_suppose fans out_there
food_is made_fresh
very_tasty_and spicy to boot
their gulab jamen is_amazing
that's pretty much all_i gotta say_about that
their dosa was_good_but the_potato filling was plain
all in_all its solid
i'm_not_a south_indian
but_a north_indian
but_i know south_indian_food
as_i_have lived_in south of_india for some_time
anyways we_have_been going_to udupi
since last years
we_used to love_it soo much_that we_went_there every_week
but_then the owner's changed and over_a period of_time
the_quality_of_food has deteriorated
the sambhar became thinner and thinner
the idlis are dry
and_overall the_buffet_is just the_same stuff again and_again
you cant really go_there everytime to_eat the_same things
the_staff_is really_good
one guy whos been waiting tables there from a_long_time
recognizes us_and is very_polite_and prompt in_his service
i found_this_place on_yelp
and went_there_for the_lunch_buffet
having read_the_reviews
i_had really high expectations of_the_place
but_was sorely disappointed
watery sambar and rasam
hard idlis
dosas with_a miserly amount of_potato stuffing
gulab jamuns that tasted nothing_like gulab jamuns
inattentive and too few waiters
and disgustingly dirty bathrooms in_my_opinion
udupi_cafe missed the mark completely
their a_la_carte_menu items might be_better
but i_am_not going_back_to find_out
the_cheese dosai is essentially india's vegetarian philly cheesesteak
this alone makes_the trip worthwhile
but is_not_the end
the_curries_are also_excellent and_flavorful
the_lentil doughnuts are a_great appetizer
light_and puffy
the_only con is_that one_is inclined to overdo oneself at_the_buffet
which_isn't even really that_much of_a con
another mediocre indian_restaurant
mediocre food
mediocre service_at mediocre prices
some days can_be less than mediocre
if you're craving_some specific dish
and_your drew lots for_this
i_guess it's okay
i_am_not_sure anyone would choose to_go_here
meh
i_love indian_cuisine and_this_place_is awesome because everything_is vegan or vegetarian
a_friend_and i_walked_in and_ordered to_go
it_was_pretty busy and_the_menu offered a_wide_variety
i_didn't recognize the_names_of the_dishes so the_host helped to_explain the_dishes and that_there_were different regions of_indian_cuisine
we_ordered
vegetable_samosas mmmmmm so_yummy
stuffed with_potatoes
onions
and_peas
i_liked_it dunked in_the yogurt_sauce
poori indian bread
this_was good_with the_chutney but it_was_a_little crispy for_me since i'm_used_to eating naan
mango_chutney sweet_and spicy
huge chunks_of mango
vegetable_curry the_flavor_was perfect
spicy_but_not too_spicy
lots_of veggies
extra rice
overall
it_was_pretty_good
i_think_that it_was_a_little pricey for_the_amount_of_food you_get
i_would_go_back to_try_the_lunch_buffet since you get_to_try a_variety_of things for_a better price
a dedicated meat_eater
interestingly enough i_have_found this to_be some_of_the better indian_cuisine in_the_valley
i_am still trying places
i_knew going in that_this_was an_all vegeterian location_and on_this day
the_buffet greeted me with_all vegan delights
while initially missing my_indian favorites with_chicken
paneer
lamb or goat
i quickly pushed those ideas out_of_my mind and begin to_enjoy the_wonderful flavors_of_the various and different_dishes
i made_sure to_try a_little_of everything
halfway through_a masala_dosa was delivered to my_table
fresh_and crispy on_the_outside with a_curry potato filling on_the_inside
this was_very_good
full but craving something sweet at_that point_i was_missing the_kheer or mango pudding often available at your_typical indian_buffet
lunch_buffet_and water to_drink was_almost
hummm i_felt a_bit over charged
but paid my_bill and_went on_my merry way
to_start_with
i_tried 'idli'
with chutney_and sambar
the idli was_way off course and actually didnt taste_like one
the_chutney probably had coconut
as compared_to coconut that_i_have come across many udupi cafe's across us
and_the sambhar
absolutely pathetic
moving_to main course
all the_curries_were highly reduced and_were not_that delectable
i_am keeping this_review short and_sweet because_you cant write much about_how pathetic food_was for_the_price that i_paid
i_am never going back_to_this_place any_time in_my_life
this_is_my nd time_at udupi_cafe
and_i waited to_write a_review until a nd visit_to be_sure
the_service_here is lackluster
our_waiter actually told_us that
he only works here
and has_no input into the_chefs cooking when_we_asked him if_we could_not have_all the_vegetables in the_mixed pakora platter
seriously
the_food_is mediocre
the_pakoras are dry_and tasteless
we_had chile pakoras and_there_was no_spice or creativity to_them
the_dosa itself_is good
the_potatoes are_very mushy and_have minimal taste_and their chutneys are not_the_best quality
i_would_recommend spending more time on working on_their food preparation and less time on the_wait_staff telling us_that nothing can_be changed
as_a indian
i_would_recommend jewel of_the crown over this cafe in_an instant
this_is_my_favorite place_to_get indian_food_for dinner
i_could say that_i've tried many_things
but_that_was a_long_time ago now my_friends_and_i just order chili gobi
breaded cauliflower in_a spicy tomato sauce
chana batura
chickpeas with a_huge piece_of puffy bread
and usually the_aloo_gobi
potatoes_and cauliflower in_a yellow curry_sauce
you_will_not miss the_meat_dishes i_mean it
i_have also been to_the_buffet here_many_times and_it_is not_my_favorite indian_buffet
i_find that_the_food buffet_items can_be hit_or_miss
go_for_dinner and you_will_not_be_disappointed
as_a_vegetarian
it_is sometimes hard_to find delicious and_flavorful food_when going out
udupi's vegetarian lunch_buffet_is am az ing
i_have_yet_to try anything there_that i_didn't_like
and i_am_a very_picky eater
i've never been for_dinner
but_i_have done the_lunch_buffet many_times now
they always_have new_dishes to_try and_everything always tastes incredible
the_staff_is always attentive
and_even suggested a_spicy soup to_clear up_my cold one_day
even my_boyfriend
who_is a serious meat_eater
bugs me to_go_there all_the_time
i_will_definitely_go there whenever in_the_mood for_some great_indian_food
i_was_in a rush
but wasn't in_the_mood for fast_food
saw this_place_and decided to_try_it_out
i_walked_in and_its a_buffet setup
i_asked_if i_can do_a to_go_and how_much
man says yes and
i_said sure set me_up
hands me_a styrofoam container
and_i_asked him i_can put whatever i_want
he said yes
went_to_the line
and_what a_disappointment
the_only_thing_that looked appetizing was vegetable_biryani and idli
so_i put a_little_bit_of rice and_took idlis
plates only half_full
i_asked_if they_would bring_out some_more idli
they_said yes
shortly they_brought_out some_more to restock the_buffet
i grabbed more
now my_plate is_full
and_i_am on my_way right
wrong
the_manager or owner stops me_and says i'm sorry but i'm_going_to have_to charge you extra_for the idlis
i'm baffled
he explains that buffet takeout is_for a_variety only and not_just one_thing
i'm baffled
i ask him so if_i dine_in
and_i take a_plate_of only one_thing and_maybe the_second_time i_get the_same_thing you_would charge me twice
he says no
that's dine_in though
i'm baffled at_the logic here
so_i went along and says what are_you going_to charge me
he says
i'm baffled for plate_of vegetarian_food
i_can understand a premium steak but rice cakes
idlis
unreal
i_was tempted to_just leave the_plate there_and show him the bird
but_i already commited to already
and_i_was in_a_hurry and starving
so_i bit the bullet and paid more
never again will_i give_this_place my business
and the_food_wasn't even that_good
it's rice cakes for god sake
my_favorite_indian_restaurant in_the_valley
great_food
lots to_choose_from_and the_staff is_very_nice_and helpful if_you_don't know_what_to get
they_have sampler type orders that allow you to_try many_things
they_also_have_a fantastic lunch_buffet_with a_wide_variety
everything_is very_reasonably_priced and did_i_mention it's byob
we stop and grab_a pack of our_favorite brew and come_here_for some gooooood grub
it_is vegetarian but honestly
even if_you're_not one
you won' miss the_meat here
so_much_food and_it_is all soooo good
you_don't need the_meat
this_is_by and far my_favorite_indian_restaurant in_the_phoenix metropolitan area
they_have_the most delicious palak_paneer and i_love_their peas paratha
i_have_never_had a_bad_experience here_and routinely order their_food for_take_out
the_staff_is polite_and attentive and_the_prices_are reasonable
if_you_want_to drink housefly go_here
yes it is_true
i_liked_the onion dosa_and the_tamarind rice_and this server refilled my glass_of_water and_i_was busy reading something and about_half glass_of_water inside me
i_saw a_big housefly died and floating in_the water
man
the_owner billed me and_went to_him and talked about housefly
he wasn't apologetic in the_beginning and handed me_a coupon_for next_time
i_told
sorry i_don't_think_i will_ever come again
after_eating here_once
i_was_very unsure how_i felt about udupi
food_was_pretty_good
atmosphere nonexistent
and_service_was
shy
i typically do_not dock stars_for_the last two characteristics if the_food_is_good
so i_knew_i had to_give_it_a second chance before making up my_mind
i'm_very glad_i_did
because i_had_a terrific experience
not terrific enough to_give_it more stars but enough_to commit to being_a returning customer
the_vegan options_are terrific
every_dish i've_eaten has had_that
comfort_food
quality i personally look_for in indian_cuisine
i've tried a_couple_of_times to engage the_servers in providing a_recommendation
but_they_were hesistant to elaborate with_any dinner advice
which is_ok
i_can make_up my_mind without regretting my choice
and_our_server host this last time was_extremely_friendly and_accommodating
when_i entered at pm there_was_only one_other soul dipping some dosa in raita
it made_me a_little nervous to_see_the lack_of customers
by_the_time i_left at
the_place_was full
a_very_good
reassuring sign
for having been vegan in_az for_years
i'm surprised i_haven't_been here more often
i_was_a_little put_off by_the plain set_up and lack_of personality upon my_first_visit
but_i_am decidedly over_it
i_don't_really eat_indian_food
but this_place_has me converted
i_went_to their_lunch_buffet and_they_had the_most interesting things lined up
everything_was at least vegetarian except one item
and_they_had a_delicious rice_pudding for_dessert
this_is where_the indians eat
well
recently we_were like out_of choices so_we_went there_for_dinner
but_i assure you this_was_our last_visit to_this_place
the_dosas were horrible
nothing had_any flavor to_it
idlis were dry
and_it_was soo hot inside
their ac was_not working
really
in_az heat you do_not care enough_to repair the ac
the_nice waiter switched on a_table fan for us_that rotated between us_and other_tables across from us
i_would rather sit at_home with_my cool ac and cook my great_indian_food on my_own and make_it much much better_than they_do
ok what people say_about service
ambiance_and all_that is_right
but the_staff_is_friendly_and they fill up the_water diligently during_the_lunch_buffet
and they_get stars
the_food_is_delicious
i've been at least times basically every sunday i_am_in arizona
consistently great_vegetarian buffet
i_was overall happy_with_the food
we_ordered_the appetizer platter to_try various things
and the_only_thing i_didn't_like was_a hard round patty thing_that_was really dry
the_variety_of dips were_great
i_had_the malai_kofta
veggie cheese balls deep_fried
in_a yummy yellow sauce
and it_was_awesome
hubby had palak_paneer
cheese spinach sauce
and i_found_it bland but_he said_it_was ok
paratha stuffed_with garlic was_ok
the_garlic was bitter
i've_found garlic is bitter when_it's gone too old so_i assume that's_what happened
service_was weird
place was_empty when_we_got there_and_the first person to_the_table laughed when_i said we'd order the_appetizers while_we look_at_the menu
which_is just odd
there_were about different people coming to_the_table so i_don't_know who our actual waiter_was
but the_only person that smiled and_seemed friendly was_the man who brought the_food to_the_table
the_rest were quiet_and sort of_like mannequins that moved
nothing_was bad though
except_for maybe_the fly that kept landing on things
when_we_left
one_of_the employees
who was_missing teeth and looked_like a meth head
was begging the_host manager person to_stop payment on_his paycheck because he_didn't use_the account anymore
he said_he owed money in_the account
so_if the_check deposited
the bank would_take the_money
i_thought_this in really_bad taste
i_really don't_want_to know
great_buffet
good_food_and nice people
i_eat_here a_couple_times a_week
check_in on foursquare for off
the_best_indian in_arizona
maybe in the_country
im a chef and im very_picky with restaurants
i_am always impressed when go_there
decent selection_of_vegetarian indian_fare
but the_price per head is_a_bit staggering
it_isn't terrible
especially if_you're_a vegetarian
or vegan as they_have_some vegan_dishes
and_want_to comfortably be_able_to eat without worrying about meat
the_selection isn't expansive and_the_place isn't necessarily upscale
but the_service_is_good
it's_good to_try at least once
especially_if_you love_indian_food_and want to_try_a different side_of it free of goat or_chicken
food wise
you've got your_typical variations of dals and_lentils in different cream sauces
your basmati_rice
and_your dessert table_of milk cake and_rice_pudding
i'm sorry there_isn't much_of anything else to_say
some other_places i'd_recommend over udupi for typical
delicious
and cheaper indian_food would_have_to be jewel of_the crown in old_town scottsdale and delhi palace on asu campus
the cafe seems_to be closed for_good
somebody from_the nearby business came out and_told_us the_place stopped operating a_week ago
if you_find yourself in_tempe arizona and wanting indian_food
go_here
best_i've_had_in some_time
great tambla music
too
highlights for_me were tomato chutney_and mattar_paneer
lots_of desserts but_i_was too full
you gotta love_this_place for what_it_is
vegetarian_vegan with tons of_spices_and flavor
yeah
you_can tell the_veggies are frozen sometimes or_not the_highest quality
but_the flavors_and great cooking make all the_difference
beware the sat sun lunch_buffets are a_little_more money
open again
really missed while it_was closed the_last few_months
one_of_my_favorite places
great_lunch_buffet for vegans
good south_indian_food
went_for saturday buffet_lunch
will_definitely go_back
weekday_lunch buffet
i'll admit that as_a meatie i'm_a tough customer to impress at these veggie buffets
but madras ananda bhavan managed_to pull it_off
so did cafe_krishna
yesterday
by comparison i_thought udupi caf here_was weak
this_is_a mid sized restaurant_with a_simple but ok decor
there_are tables only
no booths
which would_have_been my preference
the_host was_friendly but the_smell_of incense burning was sure_to interfere with_the taste_of_the_food
it_did
over at the_serving tables
there_were food_items plus sauces dressings
i_was also brought an ok tasting masada dosa with curried potatoes
offered another one during my_meal
the_next issue was_that_the sambar soup_was barely warm
most everything else that_should have_been hot was_not up_to temperature either
if they're worried about people burning their fingers on_the little stainless steel bowls
replace them with china or melmac ones
duh
the rasam soup_was better
there_was salad as_well as_some puffy chips something like the_ones the mexican kids sell from tricycle carts around_town
they_were labeled papadum
but they_weren't that
the dall curry was_pretty_good but mostly everything_was just
there
neither particularly_good nor bad
most_of_the_dishes overall were labeled properly as far_as i_know
vegan recipes were identified
sorry udupi fans
for_me this_one_was a_bit_of_a dud
weekday_lunch buffet recently reduced to
closed tuesday
one_of_my_favorite places to_get indian_food
i'm vegan so i_love that_there_is so_much to_choose_from
my all_time favorite_is_the chili gobi_and vegetable manchurian
i'm so_glad udupi reopened
i_usually come_here on_the_weekends for_the_buffet
a_little_pricey
but_i_think_the quality_is excellent
i'm not_indian
and_i grew up_in_the midwest
so_i won't comment too_much
service was_just_ok
but_the_food worth a_repeat for_me
it's_hard_to find quality vegetarian restaurants_in_the_valley
let alone all_vegetarian eateries at_all
so thank gosh for udupi caf
a_tasty tempe spot that just_so happens to_be less_than_a mile away_from_the all vegan green
udupi serves a_wide_variety_of indian_food_that
unless you're familiar_with the type_of cuisine
will require some translation help when_ordering
be_warned
the_portions here are_huge
which rocks
considering_the dirt cheap prices
i_got_the sambar vada
which_are fried lentil donuts you_can dip in_a spicy_sauce
i also_got paneer_pakora
fried_cheese
and poori
big
fluffy bread
go_here for_the_food
the_ambiance_is simple
and the_tables aren't exactly the comfiest
the_service_is also lacking
last_night
like many_times
i_waited more_than minutes_for a soda refill
but udupi hits_the spot for_a satisfying
healthy
ethnic meal
the_best indian_food_in_the_valley
i've_only been_here_for takeout a_few_times
but the_staff_is really_friendly
i've been_looking_for a_place_that makes good dosas and_was so_happy to_find udupi
so_happy they cater_to vegetarians
the thiruneiveli spinach dosai is_amazing
i_can't_wait_to try_some other_things
excellent_food lunch_buffet
we find the_food_to_be top quality some_of_the_best_indian_food we've eaten anywhere
we find most_of_the items to_be vegan on_the_buffet and the_variety to_be excellent
if_you_are_not a vegetarian_vegan
don't let that steer you away
the_food_is seasoned so_well tasty
i_think most_people would_be more_than satisfied_with their meal
service_is_friendly prompt_and the_value can't_be beat
for_those who eat at_the_buffet
each person also is_served a_generous dosa
filled_with a potato like filling
that_is delicious
highly_recommended
i_went_to udupi for_dinner last_night for_the_first_time
we_had about people and_the_service_was_great
the_food_came_out quickly and_it_tasted great
the_staff_is super_friendly and the_selection_of vegan_dishes is_amazing
this_is going_on my regular rotation of restaurants
i_live close to_this_place
used_to come several_times every_week
shared_a dish with_my_husband and_still very_filling
their owner changed about month ago
kitchen staff remain the_same
year old carpet is replaced with tile and_the_decor looks fresher
i_was and_still am a_fan_of this_place
their authentic_food deserve applause
very good_lunch_buffet
all_vegetarian
a_tasty buffet that_serves vegetarian_and_vegan dishes
udupi offers_a great_variety of_curries
starches
and_desserts that_will please anyone that_doesn't need_to have meat at every meal
for_me
usually i_enjoy the veggie_dishes at_indian_restaurants more_than the meaty ones anyways
so_i didn't mind not eating meat for_my lunch
we_went_on_a sunday_afternoon
and_found a_mix_of various northern and southern_indian dishes
some buffet_items included vadai
palak_paneer
sauteed green beans
sorry
forgot the_name
and veggie_korma
there_was_also_a cold foods station with salads
yogurt
and_sauces
for breads
they_offered papadum
paratha
and they_make fresh dosa_and bring_it to_your_table
i_tried a_little_bit_of each buffet hot item
and_enjoyed each_dish
the_dosa_was light_and crispy
with_a_nice curried potato filling
for desserts
they_had ras malai
carrot_halwa
and_coconut burfi
i_enjoyed each dessert
especially_the ras malai
which_is_a sweetened creamy paneer
it was_my_first_time trying_it
and_it_was_delicious
they_also_had a thermos with cardamom infused chai_tea
with a_sign saying it could_be made vegan if requested
the_price_is expensive considering that_this_is only_a vegetarian_vegan buffet
about_to dollars per_person for_the weekend_buffet
sodas and iced_tea extra
but_there_is a_lot_of variety to_try to_make up_for_it
service_was cheerful and_friendly
and we_got_a card for off our next_visit after paying_for our_check
maybe we_will check_out_the less expensive weekday buffet to_see_how the_non weekend_buffet measures up
the_restaurant_itself_is not fancy and does not_have an_amazing atmosphere
but i_really_love the_food_here
i've_eaten in_the_restaurant a_few_times_and frequently get takeout
i_love the_gobi_manchurian
vegetable vindaloo
and special vegetable_curry
i_also_like the weekend_buffet it's_a_great way_to_try several different_things
delicious
i_had_the brunch this_time
not_my first_time_here
definitely expensive
for_their brunch
good_variety_of breakfast items the pongal was_amazing
idly
dosai were_just the_usual
the_sambar was_just_ok
they_should improve considering it_is_the primary side for b'fast
the_gobi manchuria was_amazing
the_lunch items_were ok
one snack
paratha
entrees veg biryani
decent variety_of desserts
the_gulab_jamun was_perfect this_is another place that_serves it hot
ordered mango_lassi on_the side it_was_amazing
final verdict
i_would visit_this_place again
provided
they improve their sambar
amazing
i_was blown_away at the_variety_of perfectly dialed flavors
especially in_the sauces and_chutneys
my_friend doesn't like_indian_food loved_it
the_gobi_manchurian
cauliflower that puts buffalo wings to shame
is_a_must
my_other favorite are_the dosai's
i've had_a_few types
spinach
potato mysore hot chutney which you_should try on_the side
it's_a very intense slow building sweat but incredible
they're all tasty_and come_with delicious sambar lentil_soup
i_recommend_the assorted appetizer just_for_the sauces
pickled chili chutney
tamarind_sauce
coconut_chutney
i_could_eat this_for every meal
it's literally bliss food
i_haven't done the_buffet_but my_brother said it's_a trade off
can't take_home leftovers but_more variety to_try
i_was_surprised most_of_the_dishes have_no animal products
more oily and salty than i_like_to eat but worth_it
like_indian_food
like veggie
i've got a_place for_you
if you're one_of_the v people
you_know that finding a_good_place for_your eating preferences is_not always easy
sometimes you'll look through_a menu dominated by meat_dishes for_one or_two items_that are_all starch and grease
at udupi
you have_an all_vegetarian menu_with a_ton_of vegan_options
delicious
if_you_order something with batura
you're_going_to get_a massive poof of_bread brought to_your_table with_your entree that will_definitely leave you with leftovers
want another kind of_bread
that's_a naan issue they_have many_different flavors_and varieties_of naan to_choose_from
take_your pick
at_some_point in_the_past
a_number_of yelp reviewers made complaints about_the cleanliness of_this_place
those days are apparently quite long gone
everything_was clean as_a whistle and_service with fast_and smiling
you even_get a_special copy of_the coffee news with_your_meal
this_is another spot to_put on_your list_of
must go
vegetarian joints in_the_valley
i'm pretty_sure you're_going_to enjoy_it
my_first_experience of udupi was the_lunch_buffet
being an avid carnivore i_was_very_impressed with_the vegetarian_and_vegan dishes provided here
this being southern indian_cuisine
the_options were uniquely different_from the indian_fare i_am_used_to
and_i_was especially thrilled about_the prevalence of coconut in_the_dishes
the culinary journey through southern india began with_a vada
a donut like fritter made_with lentils
dipped in_the spicy tomato chutney or coconut_chutney
it_was delectable
next came the rajma aloo
a flavorful potato dish_with beans
the_daal curry
made_of lentils peas_and beans and flavored with cumin and_other indian_spices was_outstanding with the_basmati_rice
the_highlight was_definitely the shai paneer with_a coconut cream_sauce
the_paneer
so traditional to southern indian_cuisine
has_a texture_and taste_like that of tofu
the_difference is_that_it_is cheese
made by curdling heated milk with lemon juice and vinegar
even the_kheer
rice_pudding cooked_with milk and honey
garnished with raisins_and almonds
was heavenly
with_an endless supply of dosai
thin crepe like bread that_you_can use for scooping your_food or rolling your dishes into
it_was_a excellent lunch_buffet_for roughly person
i_will_definitely_be coming_back_here for_dinner
and introducing my vegetarian friends to_this delightful establishment
after settling for_one or_two vegetarian_options on menus for_years it's_pretty overwhelming to select something from udupi
pages and pages of_meat free amazingness
my_dinner companion and_i_ordered_the palak_paneer and dhal curries and_both_were superb
i_can't_wait_to_go_back and try_more
delicious
i_live nearby and_have driven past this_place hundreds of_times
today we_finally checked it_out and_were impressed
the food_was_fresh and_there_was a_nice variety_of items
we_are not vegetarian
yet i_was totally content with_the flavor_and quality_of_food
if_you_like indian_cuisine
you must_try
the_owners
husband_and wife
were lovely_and spent time chatting with all_their patrons
we_really_enjoyed the_experience and_will visit_again
this_is the_best_indian_food_i've_had
my_tastes are_pretty basic
i'm_not into risky food
and_this stuff tasted_great from_the first bite
also
my_wife_and_i judge authenticity of foreign food by the_number_of people from_that country that eat_there
you_see lots_of people from_india eating_here
with_just their hands and_all sometimes
it_really doesn't get better_than udupi
their food_is_amazing
i_recommend_the lunch_buffet as you_get_a great variety_of_food
dinner_is great_as_well and the_gobi_manchurian is_a_must
they recently went through a_slight remodel and the_place_looks great
service_is absolutely phenomenal
god the food_is_so_good
the_gobi_manchurian is_my absolute fav
i_will_go_back to_this_place over_and over
trust_me
even if_you're_a meat_eater you_will enjoy_the_food here
only_thing i'm never too happy about is_that_the service of the_manager is_really not nice
he's confrontive
rude_and doesn't like to_admit his own mistakes
but since_i hardly ever see him
who cares
seriously
go
eat
this is_incredible food_for_the absolute pickiest eaters
sunday buffet gives you an_excellent sampling_of the_best_in vegan vegetarian_food
as_good as homemade
friendly_staff and_great_service
vegetarian heaven
love_the uttapam and dosa
i_love_this_place
i've tried several different_things here but_my favorites_are the_gobi_manchurian and the_palak_paneer
it's all_vegetarian which was_awesome when_i_was a_vegetarian but_it's just_as_good now even_when i'm_not one
portions_are pretty big so expect to_have leftovers or split something
i_still have_yet to_make_it to_the_lunch_buffet
but_i'll make_it one_day
sometimes they run a_groupon
which i've bought before_but the prices_are_pretty cheap without_it
i_wish_they delivered
great_food
large_portions
the_gobi_manchurian recommended_by our_server judy was_the_best
dosas and n indian items_that we_ordered exceeded our expectations
friendly_service nice_ambience and spacious for business as_well as large_group entertainment
with madras ananda bhavan to_the north and udupi to the_south of the_city
folks in_phoenix wanting authentic_indian veg fare are_well covered
a step above the_usual indian_buffet places
this vegetarian place has_great options as_well_as_a friendly_staff
we_went_for buffet on_sunday
they_had good options including vada
upma
gobi_manchurian
one_of best_food i_ever_had
simply amazing_food
staff_is_very_friendly and they_make food based on_your requirements
we_tried paper masala_dosa
chana batura as_well as saturday lunch everything_was superb
this_is another staple of_the east valley that_i've really missed since_i moved_to milwaukee years_ago
it's truly a vegetarians paradise
i've_only ever indulged in_the_buffet but have_never_been disappointed
i_especially love_the many varieties_of fresh chutneys and_sauces they_have for_you to_dip things in
i_ate here_for_the_first_time the_other_night and this_place_was stellar
i'm years vegan_and i_couldn't believe_the options they_had for_me
most_indian has ghee and_i_can't do_that but this_place_has many offerings i've never been_able_to try
very_friendly waitstaff with great_suggestions and_prompt service
get_the puffy bread and_the mandarin cauliflower
iknow it sounds off but_its insanely good
highly_recommended
went for_the_buffet
the_selection and_quality was what you_would_expect when spending on_a buffet
flavors_were good
service_was_good
and_the_fact that_there_was no meat_on the_buffet_was a_plus
i_would_recommend
and_i plan_to return
after_the taco's from_the taco festival wore off
we_decided_to_try out_this vegetarian_friendly spot not so_far from_our house
the_reviews seemed_to be consistently high
it_is pretty standard inside
the_decor_is nothing_to_write_home about
the_service_is_good
water_glasses_were kept full
we_needed help deciphering the enormous menu of_indian_food terms but were_able_to decide on a_couple options
i_ordered
forgive me i_can't_remember
but_it_was sort of like_a lentil pancake with tons_of veggies cooked inside
it_had nice crisp edges
with_a very moist_and flavorful inside
it_came_with dipping_sauces
a_coconut
a tomatoey soup
a_spice like aoli
and_a cauliflower curry type sauce
i_only describe them this_way to allure new comers to_try_this_place out
all were_fantastic
my_wife ordered the_cauliflower curry but it_got mixed up_and they_brought her basically my same dish but wrapped in_a giant rice crepe
it_too was_delicious_and ultra crispy but without breaking into crumbs all_over_the table
to_make up_for_the mistake
they comp'd her that dish and_still brought the_cauliflower curry neatly wrapped in a_to_go box for later dining
we read their_lunch_buffet_is really good_as_well
finally we_tried this_place_and glad_we did
i_know we'll be_back_for_more
i_had bypassed this_place before based on inconsistent reviews
but things seemed_to be looking more promising
the_decor has_some cool pictures of_india
but_otherwise boring and sparse
the_menu_is enormous
it's_a_little intimidating
so ask questions
we_ordered_the medhu vada lentil doughnut appetizer
it's_a very dense doughnut with_a crispy exterior served_with a_couple_different sauces
very_tasty sort of filling
my_husband_ordered an uthappam which is_like_a pancake
with_onions an spinach
i_ordered_the cauliflower mushroom chettinad which is_like_a curry
they accidently brought_us a dosai
thin rice crepe
instead
but_since they_would_have thrown the error out
they asked if we'd like_it
so_they packaged up_my curry_and we_ate the pancake and crepe dishes
they were_delicious
and_when_we had the_curry for_lunch_the_next_day
it_too was_amazing
huge
whole mushrooms and large pieces_of cauliflower with an_amazing curry_sauce
mmmm
everything_was so_flavorful and the_sauces_were fun to_sample all_the different ones
the_value for_dinner was_pretty reasonable
most dishes_are about and_you_can easily get two meals out_of them
service_was_good
like_i mentioned they fixed the error and_didn't charge us_for the_wrong order_the brought out but let us eat anyways
we_had our_water_glasses filled throughout_the_meal as_well which_is important when eating all_this spicy goodness
i'm glad_we gave this_place_a_try
mixed bag of_delicious flavors for udupi
i_love south_indian_food
so i_was_excited_to stop_in
if you've never_had it
it's_pretty different_from north_indian food the_spices are_more potent and_it's vegetarian
as_if the_name didn't give_it away
it's located_in_a shopping strip with_plenty_of parking
there's a_lot_of seating inside and_the_staff_is really_nice
a_good starting menu item is_the masala_dosai a_large
thin rice crepe stuffed with_potatoes
personally
i_thought_the potatoes were_a_little bland
but_it_was_still pretty_good
another good starting item is the_vegetable utthapam
i_thought udupi's was_really_good
it_looks_like a_large pancake covered with a_variety_of vegetables served_with different chutneys on_the side
really yummy
the channa batura is chick_peas served with_a_large piece_of delicious fried bread
very_nice
often times the chick_peas are mushy and overspiced
but these were_really_good
i_had_the kedhai bendhi
which_is spicy okra with_rice
the_flavor_of the_actual okra was_good
but_it's obvious that the_okra was a_few_days old_and dried out
especially compared_to the_fresh slices of onion_and bell pepper cooked along side the_okra
rice seemed reheated
too
overall
not_the_best south_indian_food i've_had
but some_good solid dishes i_would_be happy to_come_back_and eat
delicious vegetarian fare
friends brought_us curry takeout from_here and_we loved_it so_much_that we_went over for_lunch
they_have_a buffet full_of so_many wonderful choices tons_of variety_and flavor
not_so heavy as to_make you_feel_like you've over indulged and not_so light as to_feel inauthentic and americanized
this_is_a_great deal for_the_price and_the_service_is quite pleasant
too
looking_forward_to our next_visit
the_food_is_really really_bad
even the_taste_of food_is no where close_to even the_worst street vendor in_india
friends if_you_want_to torture someone please take that person to_this_place
this_place won't let_you down in_that sense
the_dishes_were limited
the_price_is high
it_was_a big mistake that i_went_there but_i request you not_to do the_same and save your money_and time
there_are_some good_things here to_eat
the_gobi_manchurian is off_the hook
the_palak_paneer is_really_good
however
there_are_some serious health code issues going_on with_this_place
things are old
were cold when_i get them and_were buffet_items from earlier in_the day
and_there_are cockroaches
i_had one_in my_food
unfortunately it_was in_the_last thing i_ate
barf
the_vegetables in my_curry were obviously frozen from a_bag
things taste microwaved
service_here is_kind_of crap
i_saw another table get_their food_before us when we_had_ordered before them
and when_we_got our_food things came out_with to minutes between
its really awkward when_i have_to_wait to_eat_and let my_food get cold because were waiting_for everyones food
although the_food_is_good
i_won't_be coming_back_here
i_am afraid of getting food poisoning
and_the roach left_me thinking_about what other nasty thing i_could_have eaten during my_meal
food_is top
servers_are amazing
even the_music_was ambient and perfect_for the_location
until one_day the_owner_was there
he kept staring at_us which_was rude_and when_we_asked to take_out the_rest if_the_food he_gave us an aluminum foil and attitude
lost regulars there
pretty_good south_indian_food although just a_bit overpriced when compared_to other similar restaurants
the_malai_kofta is so_delicious
been_here quite a_few_times but this_time it_seemed_like a_lot changed the_food taste especially
service_was_very_good
but food didn't seemed_to do justice to the_name_of the_place
papdi chat had_very less papdi and was_okay
gobi_manchurian
speciality earlier
was tasting oily
the mysore masala_dosa lacked the_red chutney inside n overall taste but the_spinach dosa_was the saving grace
great_food
as close_to south_indian as you_will_get here in_az
the_owner_is fantastic and_his staff_is_friendly_and efficient
the_buffet changes regularly and_everything is_always fresh_and_tasty
and_all_the dosas you_can_eat
i had_the_lunch_buffet and_i_really thought_it_was just_ok
it_felt very_limited and_i_was left wondering what_i_am missing
i_thought because_of_the good_reviews and_my passion for_indian_food i_would leave happy but i_did_not plus atmosphere_and service were not_great
one_of_the best vegan vegetarian restaurants accessible to people near tempe and scottsdale
if stopping by during lunch_buffet
visit on the_weekend because_they generally have at_least_one extra dish available
the_lunch_buffet is_really_good
several different chutneys
two kinds_of soup
and_peas
i_have_no idea_what the_name_of the_dish is
that_are fantastic
i_come_here a_lot as_it_is taste
inexpensive and uncrowded at_lunch time
great_food
amazingly soft_and soaked sambar vada and really_good
the_dosas were_really_good too
been_here_times in_the_last days and i_think_i will_be_a visiting again
service_is delayed but_you_can see they_are learning the ropes
but_overall really_good vegetarian_food and_is sure worth_the_trip
spectacular service_and nice waiters
the_food_was_great and i_got_the peas paratha and the_gobi_manchurian
the_restaurant_was spick and span
great environment and_nice pictures on_the_wall
have tried_their buffet_lunch a_few_times
just tried_it today
soft n crunchy vadas
perfect masala_dosa and_one_of the_best gulab jamuns i_have_had_in a looong time
parathas needed a_little_more work but were_ok otherwise
special mention mutter_paneer
just_the_right_amount_of spices with the_paneer saut ed separately before being tossed in
are the_other_indian_restaurants listening
please remember the_menu changes daily and speaking from past experience
the_food taste might vary a_lot
will update this_review again when_i visit_again
also wanted to_mention_the fast service
this_place_has been talked about both good_and bad_for many years
mainly the_bad due_to poor health scores
at last check they_still don't_even want_to participate for_a letter grade and seems to_have_a consistent stream of mildly concerning health issues
being_a veg place i_figured
that_even a_few health issues can't kill me
at worst i_would get_some good_quality time_with a_book so we_gave it_a_try
we_started_with_the gobi_manchurian
it_is listed under dishes_but it works best as_an_appetizer
this_dish is_great_and their execution worked quite well
we_had_a massive dosa_which was_great with_the many dipping_sauces
we_also_had_a vegetable vindaloo that_was forgettable
over_all the_food_was_good_and no_one got sick
prices_are on part with_any sit down indian_place
the_ambiance_is a_bit odd
me_and_my girlfriend have_been_going to udupi for the_past years with_little or no_complaints
the_food_is_always high_quality and the_price_is lower than most_other sit down indian_restaurants on_the tempe scottsdale area
now_that found_out i_am gluten intolerant the_gobi_manchurian is_out
which_is my_favorite_dish
the_menu_is very easy_to navigate if you require gluten_free options
the_waiters are_also very_nice_and will help accommodate almost any dietary concern
i_also recommend the_spinach dosai
extrra hot if_you_can handle it
i ate_at udupi on_a_friday_night when other vegan restaurants in_the_area were much too crowded
there_was immediate seating here_with room to spare in_the meticulously clean dining_room
i've heard a_lot about udupi's buffet
but_i_was here well after buffet hours
so_i_ordered an_appetizer and an_entree
vegetable_samosas with aloo_gobi
one plus is_that vegan menu_items are clearly marked with_an asterisk
making ordering quick_and easy
however
even some vegan items_are served_with yogurt on_the side
so be_sure_to avoid that
it_was no problem for_me
as_the chutney_and tamarind_sauce served_with the_samosas_were tasty when paired with the_curry as_well
the_samosas_were served quickly after_ordering and_were pretty_good
i_wouldn't say_they were_amazing
but_i_would order them_again
the_aloo_gobi was_fantastic
the_cauliflower was_perfectly tender_and not over cooked as_is easy_to do
the ratio of vegetables to curry was_great more_than enough substance in_this vegan entree for my_stomach
my_only regret is ordering it with_a medium_spice
mild probably would_have_been perfect
service_was_quick
friendly
and_attentive without being invasive
even_the restrooms were surprisingly well maintained
i_would_recommend udupi to_anyone_looking_for a_clean dining_experience and_a craving_for_indian_food
their vegan offerings are numerous and i_can't_wait_to try_the_lunch_buffet
one_of_the best vegetarian_food restaurants in_the_phoenix metro area
udupi has_been a staple of me_and_my family for_over years now
the_lunch_buffet_is always well_stocked with a_variety_of rotating menu_items and_the full menu fare is likewise excellent and_reasonably_priced
i_had lunch_here just last_week and_i forgot_to post my_review
so
i_was_really surprised_at how delicious everything_was
i'm_a vegetarian_and find_it difficult_to find eating places_that have more_than one item for_me to_choose_from
the_waitstaff was very_pleasant and_helpful very courteous
the_best dish_was the_okra
not_sure the_name_of it
but it_was_awesome
pricing for_the_buffet is_reasonable and_i_will definitely_return
and bring more_people with_me
i_have_a south_indian_food addiction
i travel a_lot and_had previously sworn the_only decent places to_eat_it are_in singapore and south_india
but_i_am really impressed_with the_quality_and flavors here
everything_was really_fresh
the_chutneys sambar flavorful
and_of all_things
the_masala chai_was off_the hook
everything_is pure veg
so_you_know the_chefs are legit and_it shows
i used_to_be
meh
on phoenix but_now i_can't_wait_to come_back just to_eat_here again
ok this_place_is_a solid stars but_not quite
i_want_to come_back_and order_off_the_menu and_try something made_to_order
i_tried_the lunch_buffet_and it_was_pretty_good
the_wait_staff_was ber attentive_and checked_in with_me throughout my_meal
even_after i_paid
the_wait_staff checked_in on_me
the highlights for_me were_the spicy mushrooms and_the coconut_chutney
they_have_a chutney_bar
which_i truly appreciate
the freshly made dosa
for every diner
was a_nice_touch
i_look_forward_to my_next_visit to hopefully give another_star
so_far in phoenix_area this_is_the place_for_indian
south
never_been_to one place so_many time specially indian
this_place_is worth_every
vegetarian south_indian buffet
i've been a_fan_of_indian_food since my_first taste_of aloo_gobi
and being_a west sider
i_am_very rarely in_this part_of_town
however this little_gem is worth_the_trip
being_in the_east valley for_a meeting with_my vegetarian co_worker
we_couldn't pass on trying_out this_place
after one trip to_the_buffet
we_were_not only hooked
we_were already full
i_have_been_to a_lot_of_indian buffets around_town
and this_one introduced me_to a_lot_of new items
and tastes
i_had_never experienced before
being strictly vegetarian
and_some vegan
you did_not_have all those
regular
dishes you find_in the_other buffets
tandori_chicken
lamb curries
etc
so they_were replaced by new_and exciting delicacies
the mushoom tikka_masala_was so go
i_could_have pulled my chair up_to the_buffet_and stayed for the_day
we_were also introduced to dosai
or rice crepes
this variety filled_with potato_and onion
if you happen_to find yourself in_this part_of_town
a visit_here is_something you_will_not regret
oh
one last thing
you_know how they_say that_you_can tell an ethnic restaurant_is good_if
they
eat_there
well during_my visit
all_the_other guests were indian
'nough said
absolutely_love this_place_for the_vegetarian lunch_buffet
the_food_is_delicious_and the_dosas are the_best_i've_had
staff_is_friendly_and helpful
my_partner and_i_were so thrilled to_find this_place_on the_happy cow app
it_is_so difficult_to find good_quality vegetarian_vegan restaurants_in_the_valley
this_place_was amazing
the_food_was incredible
the_staff_was_very attentive_and_friendly
i_just_wish it_was closer_to home_and i_would_be here all_the_time
six of_us for_dinner adults and teens fabulous food we'll definitely be_back
vegan vegetarian_dishes so_tasty
and very_reasonably_priced
every_time_we drive_by udupi_cafe
we think about stopping in finally we_got the_chance_to
we_were really hoping for_the_buffet
but_they only_have that in_the morning
am pm daily
after browsing the_menu
we_opted_for the_vegetable manchurian the south_indian thali
the_vegetable manchurian was_really_tasty was_a_very large portion
it_was_definitely priced well considering the_quantity
the manchurian was_a not very_spicy
which_i appreciated as_i'm not_a_huge_fan of spicy_food
silly
i_know
considering south_indian food_is_always really_spicy
the south_indian thali was_very large as_well contained really_spicy items
it_was_also worth_the money
the_service_was_good it_wasn't very_busy on_the week night that we_went_on they_had_a new waitress she asked_us a_couple_of_times if she_could get anything out_of_the way when there_was clearly still food remaining on_all the_plates we_didn't mind as_she did note it_was her first day
we'd definitely recommend_this_restaurant will_be_back
after having tried_a_few more indian_restaurants_around the_valley i_decided_to update my_review
previously stars to
while their_lunch_buffet_is quite_good i_find dinner_and ordering off_the_menu to_be_the key to making udupi shine bright among its competition
i_was_able_to overlook the_plastic soup spoon that accompanied my_indian tea and_the slightly rancid coconut_chutney
upon tasting their house made indian pickle
this_is only_one of_places in_the_valley i_know of that_makes their own pickle
indian paradise on n hayden in_scottsdale is the_other
so many_items to_choose_from on_the_menu_and all spiced more authentically than more mild bland
relatively
buffet offerings
definitely get one_of_their dosa dosai
we_shared one among of_us
and if_you_are_a vampire don't order the_garlic paratha
garlic lovers and those looking_to boost their immunity will appreciate_the generous amount of_garlic
don't_let_the fact that_it_is vegetarian scare you
believe_me you_won't_be missing the_meat with_all_the great_flavors and textures
best_indian i've_had_in_the valley
lunch_buffet_is outstanding
i'll definitely be_back
i've_always liked east indian_food
moderately
that_is
it's_not_a cuisine that i'd turn down
but_it's never been one i'd seek out
either
that_is until i_discovered the_tandoori village
now
mmmmm
i'm thinkin' indian
at_the se corner_of bell road and rd avenue
happily enough in_my immediate neighbourhood
the_restaurant_is established in_a freestanding building that has_been
to_my knowledge
occupied by half a_dozen other_restaurants over the_past dozen years
let's hope the_tv hangs in_there
i_have dined and lunched there half a_dozen times over the_past few_months
and have_yet_to be_disappointed with anything off_of their_menu
it's_all been good
from the_garlic_naan to the_lamb tandoori
vegetarian fare is listed on_the_menu
though i've never_tried it
chai
milky tea
is available from the_counter
comp'd
interestingly
unlike any_other east indian_restaurant_i have patronized
the_management of the_tv do_not offer a_lunch_buffet
i_heard one_of_the_owners comment that to_do_so would 'dumb down' the_quality_of his_food
given_the results from his a_la_carte_menu
i'm_not about_to argue with_the man
the_ambience isn't much
about_what you'd_expect of_a denny's
really
the service_can_be bit amateurish and clumsy
the_serving staff being composed
apparently
of work study teenagers from_the nearby high school
still
they're friendly_and do try hard
curiously
the_waitstaff are_about the_only anglos you'll see in_the_place
the_kitchen folks and virtually all_of_the patrons
from_my observation
are east indian
which says something_about an ethnic restaurant
good_stuff
the_place has been_there_for about a_year
and_one hopes they'll be_there for many to_come
it's lunchtime
hmmm
i'm thinkin' tandoori village
only_been here_once
and_once was_enough
the_place_is absolutely crap
not that_i typically care_about decor
but_it_was dingy as hell inside in_fact
your bog standard denny's is_like_a taj_mahal by comparison
as_others have commented
there_was some ethnic fair skinned girl on duty when_we_went
i_know she_was ukrainian because_the couple behind us picked up_on the accent
which_was almost too thick to understand
and asked_her
not_exactly authentic
but then_again that's something else i'm_not typically concerned with
what_i_am concerned with
however
is food_quality in particular places_that skimp on stuff
i_got_a saag dish can't remember what_it_was
probably beef or aloo and_it_was completely drowned in the_saag
pureed spinach
wife got the_butter_chicken
same_thing sauce
meat
and the_taste was_just_a ight
nothing_special at_all which_made it even_more annoying
i_could_have cooked the_same_thing at_home for_a tenth the_price
during_the course of_the_meal
i_noticed something which looked_like a black beetle with_its innards spilling out
i've seen plenty of cardamom seeds in_my time
but the_ones i'm_used_to are khaki ish greenish in colour and a_lot smaller than this_was
i_called ms ukraine over_and asked_her what_it_was
she get this gave_me_a scared expression and_said in her halting english
i
not_know
don't_eat it
then scurried off
don't_eat it
i_had_a sniff of_the seed and_it_was definitely_a cardamom evidently a giant black north american cardamom
frankly
looking_at_the place i_wouldn't have_been surprised if it_was_a beetle
never going back
i_wouldn't have even_if the_server hadn't have advised me not to_eat the_food
best_indian on the_west_side remains tandoori_times ii on ne cnr th and w bell
and_even that's_a far cry from_what i've_had_in sydney and san fran
i second mr k
's observation avoid this_place
one_of_the dirtiest places serving indian_cuisine i've ever visited
there_were food crumbs everywhere on_the_floor
the_decor_is from_the 's
very worn down
and_just not_the sort of place_that you_want_to visit
to_eat
bread was_alright
but food was_bland
server pointed out the_owner to_me_and this person was certainly not_indian
servers_were caucasion kids
teens maybe
and knew little about_the_food
insane prices considering everything else
not a_great part_of_town either
since_i can't study right_now
i_might as_well write the_review of_the_restaurant that_is to blame for_my current state
i_took_a dinner break and met a_friend_of_mine at_tandoori village
i_was thrilled
since i_haven't_had indian_food_since moving_to arizona
i_still can't smell quite right
but_even so
i_could tell that_this_place smelled good
now
the_other_reviewers are right with one_thing
the_place isn't much to_look_at
but_it's_not a theme restaurant or some fancy pants hipster fusion restaurant
so_i'm_not gonna knock it for_that
they_were playing bollywood movies on the_tv
and_that_was enough_for me
if_you_like nan
it's good_enough here to_make_it worth_the_trip
we_had_some potato
some onion
and_some garlic_nan
i've_never_had garlic_nan before
it_was_one_of_the most garlic y things i'd ever_eaten
aside from the_fact i'm gonna kill any vampires within a_mile
it_was_fantastic
the_main_dishes were_all also_good
the_chicken_tikka_masala_and chicken_curry dishes_were delicious_and had_enough kick that_it helped clear my_head
and the_paneer_was a wonderfully mild contrast between_the two spicy_dishes
all the_food_was presented well
as_well as_indian fod can
to_be fair
and_everything_was clean
for_what_we paid
we_got a_lot_of_food
even so
the late evening food_coma that's keeping me_from studying may cause some grief later
ah well
at least it_was for_a_good meal
this_is_a pakastani restaurant trying_to serve indian_food
so like_all pakastani restaurants
they_make great meat_dishes and_their vegetable_dishes are poor imitations
the_curries_were great_and so_is the_naan
the_food_here_is good_but it_has several flaws
the_place_is dirty and deserves notice
yes
i_don't need_a fusion restaurant or copper utensils but a_restaurant should be cleaned and not_have table cloths that_are stained with the_previous diners food leftovers or have food on_the_floor or seats
the_vegetarian_dishes are classically unspicy
lacking flavor_and not cooked_well
nonetheless
it_is_a good_deal and_the_food_is cheap
if_you_can deal_with your water_glass never being refilled and slow_service
it's not_a_bad place
if_you_are_a vegetarian or an_indian_food snob
avoid
in_all_of phoenix
this_is_my_favorite over_all indian_place
we try to_go_there once a_month since_we live_in_the east valley so its about a_minute drive
but_when we get_there
we_have amazing_food
our_favorite are the_tandoori chops and_the_lamb boti masala w garlic_nan
the_tandoori chops are to_die_for and i_haven't_had better ones yet
simply amazing
when_i enter a south_asian indian or pakistani restaurant for_lunch i a really_want a_buffet
i_got_the coconut_chicken curry_which_was really_good
i_did however upgrade the plain_naan to_a kheema naan
the_naan itself_was great_but i_found_the kheema a_bit salty_and the_next_time i_would_recommend just to_get_the naan as_it_is
other_than_that it was_a_good_experience
after living abroad for a_few_years
a_favorite treat for my_husband_and_i became indian_food
once_we moved back_to phoenix
i_was determined to_find_a decent indian_restaurant
after trying several disappointing restaurants throughout_the city
i_am pleased to_say_i found an_excellent choice a_few_minutes from my_house
the_restaurant_is usually near empty when i've gone in_for_dinner
that worried me at_first
but now_i consider it an undiscovered gem
i_was glad to_see_that a_buffet was_not offered because in_my_opinion
quality matters more_than quantity
my_husband_and_i order the_same dishes every_time_we dine here
my_husband is iraqi and a_lot_of indian_cuisine mirrors some_of his favorites
although he_has tried a_couple_of different_items in_the_past
we_always orders lamb_biryani and_naan
there_is definitely no shortage of_food here
we_are stuffed silly by_the_time_we leave
my favotie dish_to chicken_tikka_masala_with a
massive
side_of_rice
it_doesn't get_any better in_my_opinion
the_decor_is plain and_the_staff isn't overly friendly
the_service isn't impeccable but_the_food compensates for_it
the_good
good interior design
located_in_a really prominent place
quick_service
the_bad
some_of_the curries_are really diluted and_the quantities are_served are less
the_indian breads are not_only overpriced but_also taste worse off when compared to_tandoori_times which_is_a nearby competitor
times also_has my_favorite bread
chilli naan
which_i is_not available here
amongst the_appetizers
the_samosa is good_but_the aloo tikka is_really bland_and poorly cooked
overall
i_would_suggest other local alternatives such_as tiffin india for takeaway and tandoori_times for dine_in
okay
the_place does not_have the_best atmosphere or decor
but_the_food_is pretty tasty_and_the prizes are_reasonable
good place_to_go_for a casual
quick bite to_eat
my_wife_and_i just moved_to this_area from_the east valley where_we were near the_best_indian restaurant_in_the_valley in guru palace at baseline and gilbert rd
this was_some_of_the worst indian_food_i've_ever_had
and_this_is in_no way_to demean the_amazing meal i_had there but_i_have had_better_indian_food at taste_of_india in fargo north dakota
we_got take_out so i_can't_speak to the_atmosphere but_when i_walked_in there_was one_other person there_and_the owners
the_garlic_naan_was more_like pita_bread it didn't_feel or taste like_it_was cooked_in_a tandoor and_was thick
i_would_say they bought it somewhere and_just reheated
my_wife got_the staple chicken_tikka_masala
i_make better chicken_tikka_masala
the jew from ny makes better chicken_tikka_masala then tandoori village
there_were count them chunks_of_chicken and_a sauce that_was filled_with whole spices_and the_wrong kind of chunky
no onions
no peppers just bits_of bay leaf and whole cardamom pods
it_was_pretty gross
i ordered_the_tandoori lamb_chops as_i'm a_lamb lover and_thought this_would_be a_good_thing to_try since i_don't_see it_on too_many menus
my dish_was skinny chops and_one massive
i_don't what_kind_of portion that_is but_it's_not a_dish portion
this was_our_first and_only time being_a patron of_tandoori village
i_can't_wait_to try tandoori_times as_it's closer and_has to_be_a vast improvement on_this awful meal
this_was hands_down_the_best_indian food_i_have_had to date
i_had sort of given up_on indian_food_with most_of_the restaurants_in_the seattle area going_to a_lunch_buffet which_is just luke warm gross food_like every_other buffet i_have_tried
i_didn't_want to_spend a_lot_of money and_most_of their_food_is and above so i_got_the tandoori_chicken wrap
sweet mother of ganesha this was_amazing
tandoori_chicken
vegetables and_spices in_a_very hot very fresh_naan wrap
the_service_was polite_and prompt
the_place seems_to be mostly frequented by_the local_indian populations
we_were_the_only non_indian people_in there
being a_family restaurant
expect to_have kids all_around you
being kids
on_a side note and i_am_not_sure if_this adds or subtracts from_the over_all authenticity of the_experience but the_smell coming out_of_my ass today is_like_a mumbai slum
so_i hear
woooooo weeeeee
very_disappointing taste
presentation of_dishes is very_bad
ambience_is ok
service_is average
this_is in_comparison to so many_indian_restaurants we_ate in us
dine date
feb
hope_they improve it soon
full details below
of_us went
vegetarians_and non vegetarians
pakoda made_of only potato not cut properly
generally we expect onion gobi
chicken_tikka tastes good
juicy and_nicely marinated
lacks presentation
the_onions provided are_not seasoned_and are white onions
specifically order_for more_spicy
hot
but we_got it_very less spicy dish
chicken_biryani specifically ordered for_less spicy and_its too_spicy
hot
has lot_of peas_and less chicken
no coriander added
chicken_is well_cooked but the_dish lacks many ingredients
doesn't feel like_a biryani
mutton biryani specifically ordered for_less spicy and_i_was sweating heavily by_the_time i_left
again too_many peas_and less mutton
mutton is tender_and cooked_well
but the_dish as such does not_have that biryani taste
vegetable_biryani except_for potato_and peas
there_are_no more vegetables
c'mon
at_the least we expect a_couple_of gobi_and carrot pieces
the_side_of raita provided is horrible
there_are_no cut onions tomato coriander green chili in_it
its plane yogurt mixed with_lots_of water
dal_makhani nice taste_and proper quantity
basmati_rice not properly cooked
is cooking plane rice so hard
soft_drinks they_do refill it
but_the soda doesn't_have proper soda in_it
its like as_if you leave_a coke bottle open_for hour_and drink it
pricing reasonable_and equivalent to_other_indian_restaurants
service good
the_waitress is_very presentable
doesn't bother to_give us choices
also doesn't bother to_tell our specific needs_to the_cook
seriously
i_can have_that in_a buffet_or in_a fast_food_joint
finally my_friend giving us_the treat
decided he will_take us_to a_better restaurant again
everyones disappointed
i_see folks dissing this_place_because it's
in_the shell of_some old diner type place
no
shit
sherlock
this wasn't formerly the taj
mahal but who gives a rat's derriere anyway
i_come_here for_the_food
once after_eating
here i_tried all the_other_indian_restaurants
in_the_neighborhood
they_were just_ok in
comparison
a_few have even gone out_of business
since then
one_of_them that shares the_first part
of the_name had food_so bland the_only flavor
seemed_to be salt
even the_rice it_came_with
was_just plain like_it_was minute rice_or
something
and on_top_of_that
they_had_a really
obnoxious belly_dancer
what_the heck is up_with
that
a_belly_dancer
isn't_that like walking
into lolo's and seeing freaking riverdance being
performed
but back_to_the village
parking here
is_always easy lots_of space
often times my
group is_the_only group_of people not of_south
asian origin
that usually speaks to authenticity
if_you_go for_that sort of thing
love_their mint
chutney dip for_the papadams
the_other dip that
comes_with them is too_sweet i_usually leave it
alone
they_have_a guy that's got_a tandoori oven
and knows how to_use_it
any_of_the naans are_always
a sure thing
i'm_a sucker for vindaloo though
i've
tried_this same dish in multiple places_in_the general
vicinity several square miles or_so and haven't
found one that_has just the_right flavor like_the
way this_place makes_it
if_you_get bored while_eating
you_can catch up_with_the latest bollywood hits playing
on_the tvs in_the_place
don't_forget to_take_a spoonful
of after_dinner mint fennel seeds combo to freshen your
breath before_you leave
hands down one_of_the_best_indian places_i've_been to
when_it_comes_to restaurants
i'm more_of_a food over service kind of girl
the_service
decor_and ambiance don't_really matter to_me so_much as_a good_meal does
this_place_is nothing to_look_at
i_think it_was_a fried_chicken shack before tandoori village took_over it_and_it still looks like_it
the waiters_are teenagers du jour and_are acceptable
but_you might_have to_flag one down to_get_your chai or water refilled
but like_i said
that hardly matters when_my star_review is_all about_the_food
to_start
order hot_chai
it will_come unsweetened and very_hot but stir and stir with sugar while_you wait_for your_meal
you'll find yourself strangely addicted to a_second cup
even if_you_don't_like whole milk
i detest it_and this_is_the_only time_i drink it
the_naan basket is_fantastic a_variety_of flavored naans
onion
garlic
potato
also fantastic is_the papadum it's like_a flat crispy cracker flavored with indian_spices
try_it with_the two chutneys the_green one_is mint_and hot
the_other is sweeter and earthier
also try mixing them
i_love the_palak_paneer a spinach dish made_with indian cheese and the_basmati_rice
the_vindaloo is_also amazing
their_curries and
sauce dishes
will share a_little easier than their_tandoori or grilled dishes get a_variety_of sauces_and meats_and trade around_the table_for a_little sample of_everything
i_always leave a_little_high on spice_and very_satisfied
it's nothing_special to_look_at
but it_really depends on what_you go_in wanting
if_you_want_a
slice of_india
complete with belly_dancers and ornate carpets
you_might want_to try somewhere_else
but_for fantastic_food at_reasonable_prices
this_is your place
best indian_food_i've_had
what_the atmosphere lacks gets more_than made_up_for in_their quality_of_food
no_complaints with_this_place
i'd come_back in_a heartbeat even_if it's on_the_other side_of_town
i_loved food
my first_time_here
great_service
fresh veggies
fresh meat
loved_it
i'm coming_back_for sure
i_really_liked this_place
sadly the_other day i_stopped by they are_closed
closed
as of the_end_of
bummer
indian_food is_one_of_my all_time favorites
my_experience is based on growing up_eating at nyc's curry row
th st b'twn st and nd ave
then_the few years in_my late 's living_in dirty jersey i_was exposed to a_ton_of great indo paki restaurants
so
why the_background information
simply put i'm cynical and spoiled and_didn't expect the_desert to have_such bombay
ha ha
indian_restaurants
but we_do
okay
if indian_cuisine was_bad karaoke
metaphorically speaking
and there_was_a contest like
american idol
and_i_was on_a panel with simon
paula
and randy i_know we_would unanimously vote mantra_masala healthy cuisine from_india
to_be_the next american idol
there's never a_wait and_the_prices_are fair
dinner price appetizer
variety_of nan
main course and_drink per plate
the_service_is prompt_and extremely_friendly
tonight we brought_a newbie to indian_cuisine and_the_owner
i_think she_was the_owner
she_was nice enough to_explain what's what to_our friend
tonight i_had_the_chicken vindaloo_and i'm_still thinking about_how awesome it_was
the_nan onion culcha is_made on site
piping_hot_and oh_so good
the_samosa mixed appetizer is_one you can't_go_wrong_with
i gauge my restaurant_on the_chicken_tikka masla and mantra_masala passes with flying colors
the_tikka tandoori is spiced perfectly and_always juicy
the_mango_lassi and_their taj beer are excellent
probably_not together
this_place_is extremely vegetarian_friendly
i'm psyched they_are getting ready_to start a_lunch_buffet next week
the_place has doubled in size within the_last couple_of months
it's_a clean_place with_a dark and cozy atmosphere
the_decor_is a_lot_more modern then any_other place i've been
if_you_like_indian_food you_will_be addicted to mantra_masala
the_food_was_awesome
do_i really_need to_say more_than that
ok
so since my_family is all_about take_out lately
i_can't review the restaurant's atmosphere
or wait service
but strictly reviewing the_food it_was_a_little plate_of heaven
well
make that a_big plate
i_ordered_the_chicken sag and_spinach nan
yeah
i'm a_big spinach fan
the sag had_the wonderfully creamy
soothing taste i_was_hoping for
that dish_is my comfort_food
the_nan_was freshly baked and piping_hot
my_husband_had_the lamb_vindaloo_and aloo paratha
the_aloo was slightly underseasoned for_me
and_my_husband always orders things
hot
so the_vindaloo_was good
but too pungent for_my_taste
not_for_the faint of heart
the_flavor_was right_on
though
all_the_food had_the complex and earthy indian spice combination that_i've never been_able_to recreate at_home
but love so_much
i'm_so jazzed about_this_place
they're a_little out_of_the way
i_would_have driven right by them if_i hadn't known that they're set back off_of_the road behind another business
sorry can't recall which one
if_you_like indian_cuisine definitely_go give mantra_masala a_try
let's keep these_guys in business
after an emergency room visit
there's nothing_like good_indian_food to life the spirits
this_place_is tucked_away in_a_strip_mall in_the_back corner even
i've_had left_overs for_days now and_am totally lovin' it
the paleek paneer was_awesome_and they_were_very generous on_the big cubes_of cheese
i_also_had the_lamb mantra which i'll happily order again
i only_wish the_prices_were a_little_less and_they_were so_far out west
one_of_my friends has been_to_india recently
and_she recommended mantra_masala as_a place_to_go_for indian_food
she said mantra_masala definitely served dishes reminiscent_of those she_had in_india
and_i_decided to_give_it_a_try
i've_been_to another_indian_restaurant called tamba before
and i_wanted to_see_how mantra_masala was_like in comparision to_my experience_at tamba
i_went_to mantra_masala recently for_dinner_with some_friends
this_restaurant is_small_and hidden away
so_we almost missed it
the_restaurant_was smaller than_i_expected
and_the lighting was_quite dim
with ethnic music_playing quietly in_the_background
my_friend_had the vegetable_samosa as_an_appetizer and the_lamb_vindaloo
my_other friend had_the_lamb mantra and_the taj_mahal beer
my best friend and_i_shared the_chicken_biryani
all four_of us also_had_the garlic_nan and_spinach nan
the_chicken_biryani was_a_bit mushy and not_that remarkable
my_friend liked her vegetable_samosa
but_she didn't_like her lamb_vindaloo that_much
i tasted the_lamb_vindaloo
and_i actually liked_the potatoes_in the_dish
and_the_lamb_was pretty tender
the_lamb mantra was_pretty_good
nice_and_spicy
and_we also_liked the_spinach nan dipped in_the yogurt they_gave us
i_gave mantra_masala stars_because i_felt that the_dishes i_tried here just wasn't_as flavorful as the_ones i_tried at tamba
furthermore
in_comparison to_tamba
the_portions_were quite small_but very pricey
despite all_that
we_had_a decent time_here overall
cant believe i've been living_in the general area for months_and never seen this_place
i_found_it due_to_the taco bell on_a day i_was in_a_hurry to_get_to point b
one_thing that_really surprised me_was_the price of_everything
sucks when_you're a penny pinching college student who's hungry as hell
regardless i_asked_for a chicken_tandoori
the_cook was handling my_order and recommended i_get_the day's special instead which_was only
being hungry i_didn't_care and_the faster i_can pay results in_the faster my food_arrived
chicken
special
i'd never thought i'd_be using this word to_describe indian_food_but here_it goes
this_dish was_a_bit bland at_first
not bland as_in lacking flavor
it had_plenty_of that
a_few heavy pinches of kosher salt fixed it right_up
no clue what_it_was called but_it_was hardy with a_rich flavorful sauce
large cuts of tomatoes
onions
and_the deboned chicken
garlic_nan
very strong garlic presence
nice_and coarse hunks of_garlic on_top_of the_nan
could_have been crispier
it_was_a_bit soggy but_could have_been from_the to_go bag
overall this_place_is pretty_good and_with it's close location it_can easily become a_regular for_me
from am pm is_their lunch_specials and dishes_are advertised at or around dollars
this_was_a very enjoyable dining_experience
like others_have pointed out
this_restaurant serves incredible indian_cuisine
being somewhat of_a connoisseur of ethnic cuisines
i_was_pleasantly_surprised by how close_to_the
authentic
indian_cuisine this_place_was almost_like you_were in_india itself
many vegetarian_options which_were flavorful_and yummy
chicken_masala was_out_of_this_world as_well
naan_was_fresh and_full_of_flavor as_well
the_owner_was nice enough_to point_out that they_don't use any unnatural oils and saturated fats in_their cooking indeed their food_tasted healthier than most_indian_places without_the aftertaste of
not_so fresh
ingredients_and oils
decor was_very_nice_and elegant
i_was_very_impressed considering_the shopping_center location
service_was average
nothing too incredible here
but_the people_were friendly
prices
are incredible
we_ate two lunch_specials with quite a_few inclusive dishes_and paid under
i_was very_happy_with my_bill and tipped accordingly
they_offer_a lunch_specials and_dinner prices_are also_very competitive
i_am pleasantly_surprised that this_restaurant already has so_many great_reviews as_the couple_of_times i've_been_here
our_party was the_only_one at_the_restaurant
let's keep mantra_masala in business
as it_is_the_best indian_restaurant_in_vegas
this_place_is_great
gerald and i_went_there a_week or_so ago_and really_enjoyed_the_food
their_chicken_tikka_masala was_really_good
the_chicken was_very_flavorful
and_the_curry was_just_right
it_wasn't the_best_i've_ever_had
but_it_was high up_there
and_the_chicken_was just perfect
we_ordered some appetizers
the sampling platter with_the somosas and_a_few other_things
and they_were_all quite good_as_well
the_only_thing i_didn't_like about_them was they_seemed to_all be covered_in a thin layer of salt
it tasted_great
but it_was_a_bit salty
their home_made tamarind_sauce was_delicious_and went well_with_the appetizers
we also_ordered_a special eggplant_dish that was_also pretty_good
gerald didn't_care_for it
but i_thought_it_was tasty
the_service_was_very_good
the_waiter_was friendly_and_attentive
it_was_very quiet when_we_went
there_were only_one or_two other_tables the_whole time
i_hope that_this_place picks up because_it's among the_best_indian_food_i've_had in_las_vegas
the_food i've tried is so_so but nice_decor and_the_owner and_staff are_very_friendly
the_naan can_be hit_or_miss here
one_time it_tasted_like pita_bread
maybe_they ran out
and_another time it_tasted_like ok naan out_of_the tandoor
the chick tikka_masala_is decent
vindaloo_is not_great
in_fact most_of_their curries
like_the mantra_masala
taste alike just different heat levels
have_tried the_tandoor mixed_grill and_it_was satisfactory
the_malai_kofta is_decent but_the gravy is more_like_a soup
also
one_thing_i noticed about_this_place_is that the_dishes_are consistently underseasoned
i_read somewhere that most americans consider indian_food to_be salty so_maybe this_is_an overreaction to_that
not_sure
but_i always_have to_add salt to the_entrees
pricing is_a kinda high and they_charge you a_lot for every little thing rice
raita
mango pickle
although i_had_my doubts about mantra_masala before actually eating_there
the_sign on_the exterior says
healthy
indian_food
leading me_to imagine creamless plates_of tikka_masala ew
i_was_pleasantly_surprised once_i actually_had the_opportunity to_eat_there
the_service_was_friendly and fast_and the_food_was_great
we_had_the appetizer sampler
fried goodness
chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
garlic_naan_bread and_we split_a mango_lassie
it_was_a_little pricey compared_to_other_indian restaurants_that i've_been_to
but_it_is close_to_my house and i_will_definitely_go there_again when_i'm craving_indian
one complaint i_would_have is_that_it took not_one
not two
but three visits to_the establishment before i_could_eat there due_to their weird schedule
closed on mondays
closed during_the afternoon during their off peak hours
i_get that_it saves them money to_close during this_time
but_this_is vegas_and i_would_expect a_restaurant to_be open at p
m
the_food_is_great and_the_portions_are a_great size for_the_price
my_friends_and_i like to_get a_few_dishes and_share
very_friendly owner and_staff
it_has_a wonderful atmosphere
we_were_looking for_some good_food near our new apt and found_this_place on_yelp
we_had a_bit_of trouble finding it
it's behind a_fast_food restaurant kind of tucked_away
it_was_really worth_the effort though
it_has_a great_atmosphere and_the_service_is personal
maybe i'm wrong
but_i beleive the_guy attended to_us was the_owner or chef and he_had great_suggestions
forgive me_as i_can't_remember names_of dishes_but they_were_all flavorful_and as indian_food should be vibrant and aromatic
we_enjoyed our_appetizer and_dinner very_much
i_would_suggest this_place to_anyone_looking_for indian_food
the_food of_this small indian_restaurant_is very_flavorful
i_especially love_the_chicken masala_and their_garlic_naan
the_service_is slow paced
which_was okay for_us as_we_were looking_for_a relaxing evening without the_feeling of_being rushed through our_meal
i_give this_restaurant a_star only because_they delivered a_food item to_our_table that was_not ours
it took_us minutes_to_get the_servers attention
once he noticed_that the item_was dropped at the_wrong table he picked it_up off_of our_table_and brought it_to_the correct table
the truly disgusting part_is that_we_had taken a_bite of_the item before realizing that_it_was not_what we_had_ordered
loved
loved_this_place
this_review_is purely based_on_the food_as the_service_was not_good
the_food however was pure flavor_and absolutely worth going_back_for
yum
yum
yum
excellent_indian
get it_on_the southwest side_of_town
very_good across_the board
delicious naan
excellent curries
vindaloo
it's_not cheap but the_food_is_great
i_have
on multiple occasions
had the_owner come_out and_ask what_i think about his restaurant
i_should clarify
the_prices_are great
but the_portions aren't enormous
but
i'll tell you_what
this_place knocks the socks off_of gaylords
ghandi's and any_other authentic_indian place i_have_had_in town
it probably speaks volumes about me_that mantra masala's tagline as
healthy cuisine from_india
really put me_off this_restaurant for_a_long_time
i_wasn't sure_i wanted_to_go out_for
healthy
food
but_after two_years of living a stone's throw from this_restaurant finally a_craving_for_indian without_the strings attached of driving around_town won out_and we_gave it_a_shot
overall_i am pleased we_did
there's no_buffet on_offer here
but the_dinner_menu
while small
features some tasty fare
i enjoyed_my chicken_tikka_masala_and the_samosas_were different
and rather heavy
from_what i_am_used_to
but_really excellent
my_wife enjoyed her shahi_paneer and we_both loved_the papadums and_naan
the portion_sizes_are fairly standard for_an_indian_restaurant
so don't_expect usa sized portions and_the_prices_are pretty reasonable without being bargain priced
mantra_masala isn't my_favourite indian place_in_town
but_it's certainly convenient and_a worthy contender for if_you_live nearby
tried_this_place after_reading about_it here
it did_not_disappoint
we_tried aloo_tikki which_has bold yet pleasant flavors
barah kabab was_also tasty
but_it_was the_chicken mantra that_we most enjoyed
the ras malai was_delicious
too
our_server_was helpful_and friendly
awesome atmosphere
excellent_food but a_bit_pricey
i_think if the_prices_were lowered a_bit and advertised
they_would increase their sales revenue
if_i_could get a_full meal in_there
including a_drink for i_would_go much_more often than a_couple_of_times a_year
they_offer a_good_selection_of wine_and recommend certain wines with each_dish
also
they_have_a really_nice bar
overall
i_love_it
just_can't afford it_as often as i'd_like
we love_this_place
try the_aloo tikka a_great appetizer of_potato cakes with sauce_that my_boyfriend tries to lick off_the plate
the_chicken_tikka_masala_is excellent
as_is_the curry
ok this_place_is right across where_i work so_i'm here_at lease monthly to_take advantage_of their lunch_specials
what makes mantra_masala stand_out from other_indian_restaurants is the_fact_that the_food you are_served is_not coated in oil ghee
lunch_specials here_are less than
from
i_get_the lunch for_the hungry vegetarian
i_think
it_comes_with a_bowl_of tomato_soup
a_touch of cream_and spice_in a_rich broth
very_nice start_to the_meal
the_entree itself_is
naan very soft
fluffy
warm_and tasty
no oily residue or butter on_it so_i don't_feel too_bad having all_that carb
rice the_rice_is basmati but this_is_the part_of_the_meal i dislike
it masquerades as pulau briyani but it_tasted to bland
i_usually leave most_of_the rice
eggplant_dish ok
this_is_the_best ever
it's soooo good
slightly spicy
creamy_and yet still keeping a texture
the_right combination_of flavors
i_can eat_this curry bu itself
spinach_and potato dish this_is_a nice_and simple dish_that tastes good
i_have_ordered another vegetarian set lunch that was_supposed_to come_with garbanzo beans
channa
curry
however
apparently they_don't ever serve it
instead it_comes_with a_vegetable dish_that i_remember as_being pretty bad
i've ordered gulab_jamun here_once and_it_tasted very_good
i_have_never_been here_for_dinner so i_can't_speak to_the prices_and dishes_in the_evening but this_is_an ideal place_to have_a_good
inexpensive indian_lunch that_doesn't feel like you_just gorged on sticks of butter
this my_favorite place_for_lunch
the_lunch prices_are great_and the_food_comes quickly
i_wish_the tikka_masala came with_more chicken though
don't_even ask to substitute anything
you_will_get a lesson on food costs and_how to_run a_restaurant
i've never been here_for_dinner
this_place_is closed on monday
for_me
this_place_is_great because_of_the location
i_really_like indian_food
but most_of_the good places are_in_the flamingo paradise area
and_i don't_have_a reason_to go_out towards that unlv area anymore
i_was_here yesterday for_lunch
there_were or_so different lunch_specials with about_half of_them being vegetarian ranging_from
to
only one_of_the specials was
with the_rest being
or
i_don't_remember what_the vegetarian_options were
but pretty much every plate included_a tomato_soup
rice
a piece_of_naan
a spinach puree
you_could choose either tandoori_chicken or chicken_tikki_masala for
or both for
me and_the so had_the_chicken masala_which was_really_good
the_sauce_was great to_dip the_naan in
and i_was_pretty much full most of_the_day from it
i_can't_wait_to_go_back for_dinner to_try_something_new
i_have_been_to mantra_masala times for_lunch_and had their_chicken_tikka malasa and_tandoori_chicken lunch_special every_time
very_yummy
love_the tomato_soup they_serve with the_lunch_specials and their_naan is_really_good
i_am_a huge pakistanian indian foodie
so after_reading_the reviews
i_decided_to_try this_place_for dinner
i_was from houston
tx
where there_is_an abudant of pakistanian indian_food around
so_my reviews below may be_very critical
pros
very_close
nice_decor
cons
food
mantra mixed appetizer which includes the_samosa
onion_bhaji
and chicken_pakora
samosa
filled_with lentils
i_am_used_to the_potatoes filling
so didn't_like this_one
onion_bhaji
just taste_like fried batter to_me
chicken_pakora
dipped in the_tamarind_chutney
what_do you_get
sweet and_sour chicken
my piece_of chicken fell out_of_the thick cold batter
mantra mixed_grill
they_are tiny portion
like others_have mentioned
but_it's all_good since_it's the_quality that i_want to_try_out at_this_place
barah kabob
the part that was_super grilled was_ok
but the_middle part tasted kinda mushed in_a way
chicken tandori_chicken bazari
i_don't_know
i_tried other pieces that are_not chicken_tikka
and_it_tasted kinda grainey
so_i stuck to the_chicken_tikka
chicken_tikka
this taste the_most familiar
but
i_have_not seen such_a small piece
masala chai_tea
it kinda taste_like the bigelow spiced chai_tea that_i_could easily steep at_home
office
anywhere
conclusion
i_will drive the further distance to_go_to my_favorite_indian_restaurant here_in_vegas
mint_indian_bistro
ambiance stars
food
stars
price stars
we_came_here in a_large_group for_dinner_and the_server was_very_helpful in helping us order our_dishes
for an_appetizer
we_had_the mussels mantra
the_flavor_was good
but_it_was overcooked
a lil tough and_chewy
we_also_tried the padpi chat
i_was definitely not_a_fan_of this item
for the_entrees
we_decided on_the sea bass
the_chicken_tikka_masala
lamb mantra and_the dewane handi
out_of everything
the sea bass was_my_favorite
flavored just_right
the_lamb_was dry_and the dewane handi was_bland to_me
i_think my_favorite part_of_the_meal was the_nan
i_wasn't too impressed_with the_meal_and after we_got_the check_it made_me less impressed
like_i said before
we_had a_large_group
people
and_it_came out_to_be dollars a_person
or dollars a_couple in_our case
i'm definitely_not stingy when_it_comes_to good_food
but_for the_price_and what_we_got i'm_not sure_i will_be_returning unless its for the_lunch_specials
i_ate with brenda l on the_same exact day
and_we happened_to be at_the_same table eating the_same_thing
haha
anyhoo
i_think_i totally had_a different opinion of_the_food maybe because we_had split all_the_dishes and_they gave_the birthday girl
me
the_better cooked dishes
mussels mantra i_thought_that the mussels that_i_had were actually really juicy and_tender
and_the_sauce
oh the_sauce
i totally wanted_to mop it_all up_with_the naan
padpi chat i_didn't love this_dish but_i appreciated the tangy flavors and_the crunchy bread
sea bass i_thought_this was_actually overcooked_and dry
chicken_tikka_masala i_had_the specially prepared one with extra spiciness
loved_it and it_was_not dry
lamb mantra i_enjoyed this_dish a_lot because_it_was actually really tender_and not gamey at_all
dewane handi this spinach dish did_not impress me much
and nor did_i even remember eating_it
haha
out_of everything
the sea bass was_my least favorite
and my_favorites were between_the tender lamb and_the fluffy yet crusty nan_bread
so_good
from_what i've experience
indian_food_is always pricier than_other foods
but_i_had such a_good_experience
i_guess the_price_was fine to_me
conclusion
i'm sorry that brenda l did_not_have as_good of_an experience as_i did
but_i_was a happy camper
going_back_for more
a_quiet nicely_decorated indian_restaurant_in_the southwest area_of town
we_were_the_only diners on a_sunday_night
which usually isn't a_good_thing
but_they_are hidden away
the_husband and_i_shared
lamb_biryani
baked casserole of_basmati_rice and_lamb richly flavored with saffron
the_husband has a_special liking to biryani_and immediately looked through the_menu_for this item
he ordered it_spicy and_definitely enjoyed_it
more so with the_leftovers the_next_day
malai_kofta
mixed_vegetable dumplings in savory creamy spiced sauce
i'm all_about any_kind_of creamy_sauce and_there_are very few i_don't_like in indian_cuisine
their version was_super tasty_and really_good with_the_garlic nan_bread
yum
i_chose medium for_my spice
it_also came with_rice
the dumplings were_just okay though
garlic_nan
leavened bread baked with_fresh chopped garlic in the_tandoor
when going nan
garlic is_the_only way_to_go
so_good
i_could only_wish for_more
overall
the_food_was_pretty_good
our_waiter_was definitely attentive
until he_got stuck on_the_phone with a_to_go order
it_is rather expensive_for the_two entrees_and condiment we_ordered
even with_an entertainment book coupon
we'd consider going again
but_definitely know_why the indian_lunch_buffets do_so well in_the_city
this_is_the_best indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas by far
we_have_tried most_of_their menu_items and everything_is prepared well the_lamb is tender as_is_the chicken
they_are able to prepare dishes_with great_flavors that are_not nearly as_spicy as_most indian_food
the_lamb mantra chicken sag are favorites as are the_onion kulcha garlic_naan
prices_are_very_reasonable we_always bring home enough_for a nd meal
i've_been_here twice
once for_dinner_and once for_lunch
the_place_is nice_and secluded in a_little plaza
the_restaurant_has_a very_nice mood to_it
the colors are very_warm and_the decorations are artsy
which_is expected of an_indian_restaurant
the_food and_the_service_is both mediocre
the_staff just seems a_little bored and lack enthusiasm
the_lunch_specials are cheap
all under from_what_i can remember and include soup
the_portions_are decent and_the_food seems pretty healthy
i_did feel like_the_food lacked some flavor though
my_boyfriend got the_tikka_masala_and i_forgot what_i ordered
but_i tried his and_it_tasted kind of bland
over_all
i_don't_think i'd come_back unless i_was in_the_area_and wanted a_cheap lunch_special
be_careful when_you_order the tikki marsala
i_had found feathers in_the_sauce
i'm_not coming back
i_have_a few weaknesses about_indian_food
and_as such i_am gauging this_place_on those weaknesses i_have
they_are
the_naan
bread
the_curry and chutney
i_found myself ordering the_chicken_curry during this visit
the_naan came automatically
but_it_was_a tiny bit soggy and_just warm
i_like my_naan fresh_and_hot
the_curry came not too_long after we_had_ordered and the_serving size was_ok
the_curry_was nothing_to_write_home about
i_remember in_the_past that_this_place had_a_good lunch_buffet
but the_last_time_i visited here_it seem_to_have been long gone
the establishment was_clean
the waiting service_was_excellent
the_food_is just_ok
in_my_opinion
if teriyaki madness
which_is adjacent to his restaurant
began serving naan at_their store
this_place would_be in serious trouble
my_first venture into attempting to_find good indian_food_in_vegas has ended in failure
it_wasn't_bad
but_it_wasn't good
i've_had better
in_fact
i've_only had_better than_this
and_it_has always_been much cheaper
this_is like
the panda express of_indian_food with a_really_nice atmosphere
this should_have been my_first warning
the_total bill for_two_people came_out_to about
a_few_weeks_ago i_was_in a_pretty shady looking indian_restaurant
most_of_the best ones are shady looking
in san_francisco and we_ordered a_lot_more
it_tasted better
and the_bill didn't_even make_it to
if you're totally clueless about_indian_food and_your idea_of travel is driving down_to mesquite
then this_place_is probably perfect_for you
unfortunately
i didn't_come to_have american food_with an_indian theme
i_was_looking_for something_that had_the rich
deep
and complex flavors that i'm_used_to
the lowdown
naan ahhh
the king of breads
naan_bread usually whisks my senses away at_the very first bite
i'm_a bread lover
and naan_is easily one_of_the best types_of bread in the_world
usually
this_one_was
good
not_great
certainly_not amazing like it_should_be
just good
garlic_naan i_have to_give_them kudos on their_garlic_naan
it_had_a better flavor than many_of_the others i've_had
garlic_naan usually doesn't stack up against regular_naan
but_this_one was_actually better_than their plain_naan
that's not_the_best compliment
but_it's the_only_one they're going_to_get today
chicken_tikka_masala hmm
like naan
it_is one_of_the_dishes that_i judge an_indian_restaurant on
usually
rich
creamy
and surprisingly complex
this_one_was decent
but a_bit bland
with none_of_the richness and depth that i'm_used_to
it_was_more like chicken campbell's tomato_soup masala
chicken mantra it_tasted
thin
like_a watered_down version_of what_it_was meant to_be
the_flavor_was actually decent
but once_again lacked richness and depth
the_rice_was a_disappointment
and_a previous yelper's comment about_it being_a
mouse sized portion
wasn't_too far off_the mark
a_big mouse
to_be certain
but_still a mouse
it_might_be the_best_indian in_vegas
but_i hope i'll find better
close_to our house and_great_food
must_try the_eggplant bharta and_the_chicken_tikka_masala
two of_the_best dishes on_the_menu
regrettably i'm_going_to have_to knock some stars off mantra_masala as i_feel_like the_quality_and value_for_money is dropping off sharply
this_place_has never been our favourite indian option as far_as flavour goes
but for_a local place_where we_can get_some takeout it more_than fit the_bill
unfortunately
on our_last couple_of visits the_naan has_been extremely rubbery and we've felt like they_have really skimped on_the content of_our dishes_that we_ordered
our shahi_paneer on the_most recent occasion contained a mere five chunks_of paneer in_a sea of_sauce
sorry guys
but when_you're charging slightly higher prices than_average for_your entree portions already
i_expect more_than cubes_of cheese for_my money
on_our previous visit we fared a_little better
with seven bits
but_it's still_not very_much is_it
mantra masala's food is_generally ok
perhaps not_quite as tasty as_some of_our favourites
but_in terms_of value they are_going downhill fast
to a_point that not_even their proximity to_my home will call me back
in a_word
yummy
indian_food tends toward the expensive side
so_i appreciate mantra masala's lunch_special menu
i_went_with
lunch two
featuring chicken_tikka_masala
it_comes with_a_side_of dewane handi
spinach puree with assorted vegetables
some seasoned basmati_rice
and_a decently sized piece_of_naan
to_be real
it's_not_a whole lot_of_food for
tax
but mantra preaches healthy food
with_that in_mind
it's_a_good portion and_definitely satiated my appetite without making me overly full
and most_importantly
everything_was_delicious
i_prefer the_flavor_of mantra's chicken_tikka_masala over mint_indian bistro's
the_naan_was cooked_perfectly and_the dewane handi was surprisingly_good
i've_never_had it_before
i_haven't eaten dinner_at mantra
looking_at the_dinner_menu prices
i_probably wouldn't want_to
for_lunch
however
it presents a_nice option
it_is_a_bit far_from work
but_it's_a quick zip up_the
i'll definitely get lunch there_again some day
note
a_sign outside advertizes lunch_specials under
this_is misleading
one lunch dish_is
the_rest are
or higher
stars
we grabbed lunch_with a_friend_who lives in_the_area
we_all grabbed a_lunch
chicken_tikka
dwane handi
seasoned rice
naan_and tomato_soup
it_was_good
but not_the_best
chiken tikka_was juicy
but the_tikka sauce seemed less complex than others
dwane handi is_good
tomato_soup was_pretty standard
naan was_okay
the_portions aren't that big
but_it did_the trick
i_just was_more sad about_the tiny dollop of_rice
i_mean isn't_that the_point of_the rice_and_naan is_to sop up the_sauces and_flavors of_the_dishes
by_the_end i_was just taking spoonfuls of_the_dishes since_i was_out_of rice_and_naan which to_me is_a travesty
this asian has to_have rice
isn't bad for_a_lunch
but with_a_lot_of indian_places offering_a buffet_for it_isn't necessarily value when compared
but good_value_for being the_only_indian in_the sw and few_places with lunch_specials there
service wasn't really personable
we_didn't get_any drink refills and when_ordering drinks he_took mine and_the bfs drink order_and turned around without asking our friend if_they want a_drink
no drink for_you
it's okay if_you_want indian nearby
but_i_think a drive out is worth_it
so now_the rice has become bright orange and inundated with carrots and cauliflowers rendering the_actual rice pieces_of the already skimpy portion invisible
this mush was_also quite inedible
the deewane handi
pureed spinach with potato chunks
was barely passable and terrifically under seasoned
the_eggplant dish_was not_as_good_as i_remembered it_being
the lentil_soup was_very lackluster and me_and_my companion struggled to_try to finish_it
we struggled in vain
the_naan_was the saving grace of_their lunch_special
soft
chewy
in_a good way
and the_only_thing we_could scoop up our gravies with
since the_rice_was not fit to_eat
to_make us_feel a_little better we_ordered gulab_jamun
how_can you_go wrong_with fried fatty goodness in_a sugared concoction
correct answer
you_can't
one_star for_the_naan and_another for the_gulab_jamun
the_food_was_a total and utter blasphemy
i_like_the lamb tandoori dish they_do_a lot
it_is pricey_but feeds me and_my_husband
this lamb_dish keeps me coming back
one warning they_seem_to doubt americans ability_to take spice so_be emphatic
service_is weird
i_always leave feeling like_i_was taking to someone with_a lobotomy
not mean or inattentive just_not all_the lights are_on
insofar i_have_found service to_be weird at_all the indian_places we_have_tried
namaste and_the celine dion covers
origin and_the credit_card at your_table issue
i_have_eaten indian_food all_over_the world and_this_place_is hands_down_the worst indian_food_i_have_ever eaten
the_service_was non existent
in_our opinion they_don't eve deserve one_star
we_could not_even finish our_meals
i_only ate a_few bites
it_was_so bad
if this_place_has won awards i question who the critics are
do yourself a_favor and_eat anywhere else
i_have_eaten my share of_indian_food in_my_life and_i_must_say this_is_the worst
the_tandoori_chicken tasted like it_was_a left_over from_the day before
very_dry like wood
the_service_is also horrible
we_were_the_only table at
lunch_time and they_took for ever to_give us_the
not fresh_food
been here_a_few_times when_i get a_craving_for chicken tandori with mango_chutney
the_chicken is_always tender_and sauce flavorful
i_always leave with my_food craving satisfied
food_is_delicious
yet service_can improve
overall it's_a
slightly better_than ok
neighborhood indian_restaurant
i'm_sure that'll make sense to_some lol
worth_a try
good_food
never oily and_has great_flavors
curry has a_little heat to_it
which_is_nice
fresh nan
very intimate little restaurant
perfect_for lunch discussions with colleagues or a_nice dinner date
service is_a_little hit miss
but it_doesn't take away_from_the quality_of_the experience overall
good_food
very_tasty
place is_very_nice_and intimate inside
place_looks closed and dark from the_outside
but they_are_open
they_just have curtains blocking the_windows
portions could definitely_be a_little_more for_the_price
but it_was_good
fresh_food
owner a brilliant chef
enthralling to_talk_to about indian_cuisine_and spices
will_be_back often
very_good
went for_some buffalo wild wings but instead i_ended_up having some indian_cuisine
service_was_very_good
the_way_to_go is chicken_curry
basmati_rice
and_garlic bread right out_of_the oven
nice small_place
went_there today on_a whim
the_ambiance_is zen
the_waiter_was not_bad
like he_did his job checked up_on us refilled our beverages but_didn't seem happy
i_would ask a question and_his reply and tone would_come out dull and rude
like cheer up dude
what's your deal
food decent
small_portions and_a_bit overpriced
i_do like the_mango_lassi
food_is_pretty bland
been_here a_couple_times just to_make_sure i_didn't just come_on a_bad day
there_are way better_places in_las_vegas_for indian_food
can't_go_wrong_with the_chicken_tikka_masala
basmati_rice
and_naan
ordered_take_out for_people the_staff_was_friendly
the_owner helped me load my car
and_was expecially helpful when_i_asked for plates utinsels napkins
overall
very_friendly_and good_food
i'd certainly return
by_far_the_best_indian restaurant in_our neiborhood
sw
i_think this_restaurant_is ome of_the_better indian_restaurants_in_las_vegas
great neiborhood restaurant to_satisfy ur appetite
my_husband_had lamb_korma and_it_was_very_good and_my chicken_tikka_masala is_very_good
as_well
i_never have_a craving_for_indian_food so we_don't visit_here often but whenever we_do
it_doesn't disappoint us
naan here are_very_good but paratha are just_okay
one_thing that_did bother me this_time is_that_the girl
the_server
did_not offer_a lunch_menu
which we_didn't know_it existed
same_thing that i_ordered could_have been less
it_made me_feel that_i_was screwed over
so
i_highly suggest_you to_ask_for a lunch_menu because_they_were not offering unless customers asked
went there_for_dinner on_a_weekday
the_restaurant had seperate couples having dinner_so it_was_pretty quiet
the_food_was_pretty_good
the_spice_level ranges from not_spicy
medium
very_spicy
we_ordered very_spicy and personally i_did_not think_it_was very_spicy
it_still seemed a_bit bland
the_chicken_biryani is what_we_had and_it_was decent
in_terms of_the prices_and the_amount_of_food you are_served it_does not compare
we_also_had_the badam lassi
mango smoothie w almond
the_mango was_very sour
i_will may go_back only because_it_is very_close and_the_food_was decent
very friendly_staff
amazing vegetable_samosas
really cute and cozy decor inside
we chose this_restaurant because we_wanted indian_food_and_this was the_closest to summerlin
i_am happy_that we_did
everything_was_delicious
garlic_nan
samosa's with tamarind and_mint sauces
made there
chicken_curry
tender lamb_in a garlic cream_sauce
loved everything
my only_complaint_is_that it_took a_long_time to_get_the food_out but it_was_worth_it
good indian_cuisine
the_service_is_great
the_food_is also_good especially since it_isn't the_typical greasy style that some_indian_food can_be
be_sure_to have the_samosas_and the_potato chaat on_the appetizer menu
the_garlic_nan was_delicious to_start off_with and the_chicken_curry_and lamb mantra were_excellent
i'll be ordering to_go next_time and enjoy_the_food at_home bc the_service awful
the_food service_here are as_good_as_it gets
delicious
authentic
warm kind waitstaff
i_say go_for_it
i went_for_dinner with_other friends a_few nights ago
the_food_was_great
the_service
well it_wasn't intentionally bad i_think but_it_was definitely lackluster
immediately upon sitting we ask_for glasses_of water
he brings glasses
with_no ice
minutes later
we ask_for ice
mango_lassis and_a coke
minutes later out come mango_lassi_and coke
still no ice and_still missing mago lassi_and waters
this_is minutes into sitting down
it_definitely was_not because_they_were swamped
there_was_only other_table seated in_the_restaurant
he eventually brought_us the remaining beverages and took_our_order
we_all ordered chicken_tikka_marsala with varying levels of_spice but what_we_got was chicken_tikka_marsala all at medium level
it_was plain to_see_that they_just made one batch and_tried to_pass it_off
at a_plate just_for_the marsala
this_is unacceptable
actually
as_i'm writing this_review i'm deducting another_star
star_for you mantra marsala
what poor_service
welcoming_and nice service
food_is too_expensive for_the taste
i_would_not rate_this as the_best_indian_restaurant_in vegas
its just_one among many
so if_you_live close_by there_is nothing wrong to_try_this one
i_am some one who give more value to_the taste_of_the_food than decoration so i_am_giving only stars as_i_have experienced better_places than this_one
we_stopped_in for a_little snack and_ordered the mantra_masala appetizer sampler
and a_basket_of garlic_naan
don't_remember the_names_of the_items_on_the sampler
but_it_was samosas
a crispy onion thing
and_a batter fried_chicken item
the_first two were_good
but the_chicken_was tough
the_two chutneys that_came_with the_sampler were_delicious too
not_the_best_indian_food we've_had
but seems_like the_only_one in_the_area
aloha
a_very quaint and intimate place_to experience authentic_indian_food
it_had_been years since_i last tried indian_food_and thanks_to a_special friend_who is a_regular at mantra massala
i_was_able_to order with confidence and_enjoy a_great_meal
i_was pleased with the_level_of spices in_the_dishes
the_service_was at_a slower pace than most_other establishments
but_it set_the tone for the_evening
no need_to rush your_meal
just sit back_and relax
i_loved_the authentic dishes_and silverware our_meals were_served on as_well_as_the decor
i_was_a_bit apprehensive about ordering too_spicy of a_meal
but_i_am happy_to report that the_next morning my tummy is feeling fine
i encourage you to_try mantra for_yourself i_think you_will_be pleased
forget the_location
it_is non descript
but_the_food
wow
amazing_food
you_can detect the_different spices used and_there_is little to no oil
the_selection on_the_menu_is not extensive
but ask the_chef if_you_want something_that is_not listed
they_do_not rush you and_service_is is_okay
i owuld recoemmend this palce for_good indian_cuisine
try the_mango_lassi
to_die_for
flavorful
tasty and_refreshing
good_food
good_prices and_good atmosphere all adds up_to more_than just good
try_the
unnumbered
lunch_special
bucks gets you a_whole heap of tastes
the_place had horrible lighting and_the_place just seemed dingy
the_waitress_was nice
but_we_were the_only_ones in_the_restaurant which makes_me a_little weary
the_food_was overpriced for_the_quality that_you received
i_love_indian_food_and this_place_was way under expectation and_my standard
i_would_never recommend_this_place_to anyone
very taste
fantastic_service
they pride themselves on no oil healthy cooking
everything_was_delicious and_you don't_feel loaded down after your_meal
make_sure_to get a_mango_lassi to wash all_that yummy food down
this_review_is more about the_experience than the_food
i_ordered_the veggie basil curry
now when_i order_something with_that title i assume it_will consist of mostly vegetables_and a_few_other things maybe
well imagine my_surprise when_i get home with_my takeout
open the container and find a_couple tomatoes piece_of potato and_the_rest is_all beans
meaning everything_in it_was_a legume
due_to the_fact_that i_can not_eat legumes at_all right_now
i_could_not partake in what smelled fantastic
i_just_wish i_had known that it_was_not actually vegetables
and i_would_have simply ordered a_different menu item
shame on the_chef and this_restaurant
way overpriced_for the_size_of dishes
ordered worth of_food including_the mantra mixed_grill over the_phone
but_when_i opened the boxes at_home
was shocked to_see meats that_looked like_they have_been chewed already
along_with poor pieces_of_chicken was_one tiny piece_of what_they call kebab
i_went_back to_the_restaurant thinking a mistake was done_with my_dish and_got nasty condescending insulting attitude from_the so called
chef
himself
worst dining both human experience i_ever_had
don't make the_same mistake
eat somewhere ellse
this_place_has the_most amazing_food
start_off with popi chat for an_app
then grab the chicken_tikka_marsala with two_orders_of naan_bread with_and extra side_of_rice
then finish_it off_with the_most amazing desert
not_sure what_it_is called but the_owner made_it for_me
it_has two scoops of_his he_made pasatico ice_cream and_this amazing little warm ball of_something
omg
it belongs in_a spa
not_sure why but every_time you take a_bite
combine the_two
it_has this amazing taste that brings you back_to a relaxing spa
enjoy
i_normally go once_a_week
this_place_was very_disappointing for_takeout
i_ordered_a garlic_naan_and chicken_tandoori
it_came in_a_small
under portion white box
but_that_was just the_start
the_chicken_was yellow and pink on_the_inside no tandoor char marks
no complex flavors
the_onions were raw and uncooked
generally disappointing considering how_good the photos look_for dine_in
came_here because_it_was close_to where_we live
the_food_was horrible
my_wife_and_i are avid indian_food lovers
the_prices_are too high and_the_quality_of food_is_not up_to par
ordered chicken_tikka_masala_and veggie khurma
the_masala tasted watered_down
the khurma had_no taste_and had strange veggies in it_for_the dish like green beans
couldn't call this_place authentic
would_not_recommend to others
my cents
the search for_a_good indian_food_restaurant continues for my_wife_and_i
this_was_the_first place_in_vegas we_tried
i'm only giving one_star because i_have_to to_be_able_to rate the business
ayayay where do_i start
veggie
khorma had legumes in_it and_tasted nothing_like a khorma
no cauliflower
no potatoes
no green peas
chicken_tikka_masala_was heavy in cream
lacking spices
cream is cheaper than spices
rice portion was_a oz dish
from_a nearby mandalay bay hotel casino
yes we flipped it over
my_husband is ' lb
we've never_had this prob anywhere else
raita
yogurt
portion was_more_than the_rice
but it_had water mixed in and_the seasoning was_way off
no cumin
too_much anise seeds
no cucumbers or carrots or spices
food_was yucky
expensive
and miniature
no_buffet
wtf
that's like_an_indian rest
staple
oh_and
we complained to the_waiter
he said owner will_be in later
and_there_was nothing he could_do
as_we_were leaving
the_owner came and our_waiter told him our problem
he said give_me a min
my_husband said we're obviously not important enough so we_left and_i'm now venting on_here
shoulda' caught me_at the_door buddy boy
a_bit_of background
i've probably ate_at more indian_restaurants around_the_world than_anything else
i_had an_indian_restaurant cater my_party indian themed bridal shower
restaurant sales went up_in_the following weeks because_my guests loved_their food
i_was_craving indian_food_and this_place_was close_by the office so_i thought to_give_it_a_try though a co_worker had_a less than positive experience on her visit
i_had_the_lunch special
chicken_tikka_and spinach puree with legumes
and_ordered to_go
the online menu states that soup is included_in the_lunch_special but when_i_asked about_it they_said
not_for to_go orders
that stipulation was_not stated on their_website
the person_who took my_order seemed a_tad bit confused and_did_not really understand what_i_was saying
when_i_went to_pick_up
my_food was waiting in_a
locker type
container and wasn't_that hot
i opened the styrofoam box to_find half_a piece_of_naan
as a_fan_of indian_cuisine i_was most looking_forward_to this part_of_the_meal
the_naan_was thin_and simply o
k
the_portion_was a_bit small_for
only pieces_of_chicken and about a_table spoon of veggies
the_basmati_rice lacked in_flavor and disappointed as one_of_my_favorite parts to indian_cuisine
all in_all it satisfied my instant craving_for_indian_food but_would not go_again due_to_the portion_size and lack_of flavor
it_was_the epitome of_the
star
rating
meh
i've experienced better
good_food
nice_ambience and_friendly wait_staff
but manager needs some anger management skills
we_were having a_wonderful dinner_and asked_the_waiter to_leave the_drink menu
shortly afterward
the_manager came_by in_a_hurry and snatched it_up off our_table
he_then screamed at our_waiter for_not removing it earlier
as the_waiter stumbled with words
we interrupted and explained to the_manager that_we_had asked that the_drink menu stay
he apologized to_us and_then continued to berate the_waiter for_not letting him know our request
the_manager also_had_a nasty habit of berating the_wait_staff on the_dining_room floor
in_front_of customers
we_were sitting_on the_opposite side_of_the dining_room and could_easily hear him
we_would_have had_a wonderful time
if the_manager didn't make us_feel so uncomfortable for_being there
what an awful way_to treat your help
really loved_this_place
everything_was_delicious
would_definitely_recommend the_lamb_korma curry_and_the tandori_chicken
the_rice_pudding was_excellent
i_know rice_pudding is normally just pudding
but_this had something extra
food_tastes
clean
not_overly greasy
heavy
or huge portions
the_perfect chicken_tikka_masala i_have_had in_a_long_time
slight tinge of sweetness to the_spiciness
was heavenly with the_garlic_naan
good_food
however
the_portions_are small
i_go_there a_few_times a months due_to_the fact its the_only indian_food_in_the sw area which_is where i_live
i_really_like_the chicken_tika_masala and the_malai_kofta
i_had some_of_the appetizers as_well and_they_are all fried and_doesn't go very_well with_my healthy diet
i_would_recommend mantra masla if_you_are in_the_area_and craving_some indian_food but_i_think there_are much better restaurants_in_town such_as mount
everest
hope this_review helps
they_need to_add dark chicken_curry to their_menu
my_favorite_indian_restaurant
great_food_and awesome service
it's_a_small place_and tends_to be really quiet
it's_definitely a_hidden_gem
ate here_for_the_first_time tonight
and_i_was completely blown_away
the_food_was_excellent
i_had_the saag_paneer
and_loved_it
the_cheese and_yogurt is_made there at_the_restaurant
and_the_portions_were the_perfect size
not_too big
and_not_too small
the_ambience would_be great_for either a_date
or_just for_a_nice night_out
and prices_were reasonable
i_highly_recommend it
and plan_to be_back soon myself
very_authentic indian_restaurant
really_enjoyed_the_food but_nothing out_of_this_world to_die_for
the_interior decor along_with_the choice_of music could_have matched the_restaurant theme very_well
very pleasing experience all_around
i_was craving_for_indian_food that's why i'm here
had chicken_curry_and cauliflower with potato
they both taste the_same
not_much favor
not_the_best_indian_food i_ever_had
amazing_food
have_been_here twice
very intimate setting
good_service great_food
garlic spinach nan_was so_yummy
so_is the_chicken_tiki_masala
good honest food
my_wife_and_i are_both vegetarians_and really_enjoy the vegetarian_menu
every_time_we go we_have good_service and_great_food
i_have_never_had anything_to complain about
went_here_for mother's day since_it_was close_to_home and_we_were craving_indian
i've had_indian_food all_over vegas_and this_was_one_of_the worst experiences
i_really wanted_to like_the place_as i_love to support local mom_and_pop establishments but_this_was quite disappointing
we_ordered_the chicken_korma
lamb_vindaloo
veggie_samosa and some_garlic_naan
the_chicken_korma tasted off and was_really oily
the_lamb_vindaloo also did_not taste_like other vindaloos we've_had
this tasted a_little_too tangy
the_garlic_naan tasted like_it_was reheated in_a microwave so it_got hard and_chewy once it cooled down
the_only saving grace was_the vegetable_samosa
which_was filled_with potatoes_and peas_and had good_flavor
i_wish_i_could say_that i'd try_this_place again
but i_think_i'll just drive further and go_to_the mint or india_palace for better_indian_food
we_have lived in_the_area for awhile now and_always drive_by
i_read some reviews_and was_a_little worried but we_decided_to_try anyways
i'm_so glad_that we_did
we_got_there right after they_opened for_dinner so we_were_the_only table there_for a_little while
the_decor_was pretty_cool and calming
the_music_was pretty calming as_well
our_server was_attentive_and our_food_was absolutely_delicious
it_wasn't busy_but it_should_be
we_will_definitely_be going back
this_is_a_great place_for_indian_food
it's one_of_my_favorites in_the_valley
it's a_little_on_the pricey side
but well_worth_it
every_dish i've ordered has exceeded my_expectations
will_always come_back_and dine again
great_experience_and meals
soooo my_husband_and_i just relocated here to_vegas from atlanta and we_love it_here
just_so happens that_i_had a_taste for some_indian_food
so i_found_this on_yelp
this_is literally minutes_from my_house
the_food_was_delicious
i_got_the tandoori_chicken
vegetable_samosas
naan_bread
then_i desired something a_little sweet so for_dessert i_had_the galub jamun
which_were great
just simply two small round balls drenched in rose syrup
this_place_has a_very_nice small intimate setting and_everyone is_nice
can't_wait_to go_back
i_will_try the_chicken_tikka_masala
finally
a_decent indian_restaurant in_phoenix
and i_have_tried a_lot_of them
we_went_to tandoori_times from a_recommendation of_a guy i_work with who_is pakistani and_is married to_an_indian woman
yeah
i_know
their parents were probably ecstatic when they_brought each_other home
so_we figured
if he_is recommending it
why_not
we_were pleasantly_surprised
we_had_some samosas
chicken_tikka
palak peneer and vegetable_biryani
all came out piping_hot_and quite_tasty
the_chicken_tikka was_tender_and not_at_all dried out
the_palak peneer was_excellent a_little sweeter than i_am accustomed_to
but_still very_nice
my_son
who_is three
couldn't get_enough of the_biryani he kept shovelling it_in
and the_samosas choolay
sp
were_very_good
the_sauce they_brought them_out in was_just spicy_enough to_enjoy without overrwhelming the_food
so stars_for_the food
and star_for_the service
our_server
omar
is_an asu student and_he_was great
he said_he is studying elementary education so_he was_really_good with_our son
we_will_definitely_be eating_here again
btw
while the_restaurant_is good_for kids
unless your child is able to_eat spicy_food i_don't recommend_it
in_our case
my_son seems to_be_able_to eat all_the spicy foods his mom so loves
disappointed the_first_time
but with_our faith in mr k's taste
we_tried it_again and was_pleasantly_surprised
first_time_we went_for_lunch and_had mainly chaats
indian snacks
which_are only served sat sun pm pm
our obsession with chaats started at_the famous vik's chaat corner in berkeley
when_we used_to live in_the_area
unfortunately
the chaats here were lacking_in flavor
which_is_a big problem given indian_food
especially chaats
is all_about_the spices
for the_phoenix_area
we prefer little india chaat in_tempe it lacks decor_and service but_is made_up by cheap prices_and tasty_food
given our obsession with_good naan_and our faith in mr k's taste
we_decided_to_give it_another shot
we_went_for_dinner on_a_sunday and_ordered
saag ghosht
lamb cubes with_spinach in_a light cream_sauce
highly_recommended by howard seftel as
helpfully
quoted on_the side of_the_menu
we
on_the_other_hand
found the_lamb cubes themselves to_be dry_and bland despite being_in a_tasty sauce
fish goa curry
fish filets in coconut curry_sauce
sunday's daily special so came with_rice
one naan_and salad
this fish was_the bomb
perfectly balanced subtle spices_that complimented the tender flaky fish instead_of overwhelming it
the_naan is_as_good_as mr k claims
great modern decor and_good_service
we_are definitely_going back_on a_sunday_night for the_fish goa
thanks for_another good recommendation mr k
well
it took_us trips until we_finally found_this_place open
they're closed on mondays
and between pm
but fourth time's the charm
i_guess
i_had_to dock a_star for_their lack_of samosas_and the_usual sweet brown sauce i've_had at every indian_restaurant i've_been_to
i_ordered_the aloo_tikki
chickpeas
onions
and_potato patties
asking them to_leave off the_tamarind_chutney and replace it_with raita
yogurt with_mint and cucumber
it was_very_flavorful and_moist
though a_bit spicy
my fault for failing to_ask_for mild
i_also_had the_vegetable_korma incredible
it_was_a thick stew of squash
potatoes
peas
corn
and carrots
and it_almost tasted pumpkin y
so savory
the_best_part was_the corn kernels they_were slightly crunchy and added an_amazing dimension of texture
jamie's meal_was the lamb_masala
we'd been meaning to_try lamb again
as the_first_time_we had_it
elsewhere
it_was chewy and_just
not_very appetizing
well our minds were changed
this lamb_was_tender and succulent
and_the masala_sauce
incredible
full_of complex flavors and_spices
it_was_amazing
we also_got breads the onion_naan
so soft
almost moist in_a good way
and_full_of onions
and_the_chicken naan
full_of tandoori cooked chicken
and infused with_a smoky
almost barbecue
flavor wow
so
some_of_the most well_spiced
tastiest indian_food_i've_had
as_well as very friendly_and_helpful service stars
so
i_am sorta new_to_indian_food
i_was introduced to_it last year by my_indian coworkers and_i_am hooked
this_place is_by_far my_favorite
i_liked_it from my_first_visit
the_waiter_was helpful
knowledgeable and put up_with my indecisiveness
i have_liked everything that_i've tried here_and i've tried a_lot
i_usually_go with my_indian friends_and therefore get_to_try new_things that_i might_not have_ordered for_myself
my_personal favorites_are the_chicken_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
and some_sort_of shrimp_dish that i_don't remember_the_name_of at the_moment
they_usually have a_belly_dancer on the_weekend which_is always fun to_watch
the_bad
no samosas during_the week
why
the lamb_chops
which our_server recommended
were crap
the tiny quarter sized piece_of meat_was oh_so good but_they_were full_of fat and bones
so_it_was about for bites of_lamb and a_plate_of bones
the_good
nicely styled restaurant
bright colors and_modern open layout
the_appetizer we_ordered_was a_veggie patty on_a bed_of spicy chickpeas
the_lamb vindaloos was_one_of_the_best i've_had
the_garlic_naan_was perfect
complementary chai_is available
i_thought is was_a_bit week but_good none the_less
ps
no belly_dancers here_on_a wed evening
maybe they_have them here on_the_weekends like they_do in_scottsdale
not_a_bad place at_all
it's_also reasonably new
up until a_couple_of months_ago my_office was_a quarter mile from_this_place
i'd passed the_sign a_couple_of_times and_gave it_a_shot one evening
prior_to trying tt
i'd been a_regular at maharaja's palace
pretty much on_the diagonally opposite
sw
corner_of th ave
and if_you_like you_can read my review_of the_latter to_see why i_won't eat_there anymore
i_was_pleasantly_surprised by the_quality_of_the_food at tt
it's a_little_more expensive but_the_food appears to_be of higher quality
basically the_naan_is the freshest tastiest i've_had_in_the us
unfortunately they're light on beef dishes
probably because_the moo cow is held in higher regard than people_are back in_india
and_i missed things_like beef saag_and vindaloo
but_everything else_is real good
they_have
chaat
on_the_weekends kinda like the_indian equivalent of spanish tapas
but_there_are several items on_this particular menu_that aren't available during_the week and_that's a_bit strange
lunch_specials are pretty_good
there's_a different main_dish each day_and they_serve quite an acceptable portion_of rice
that dish
salad_and raita
unfortunately most_of_the guys in my_office are phoenix born and for_some_reason they consider indian_food to_be anathema
i've literally gotten laughed at when_i proposed this_place once as a_lunch destination
and thus i typically don't_have too_many lunch partners when i've_eaten here
then_again these_are the_same guys who'll eat the_most wretched mexican slop i've ever gagged on in_my_life
day after day
over_and over_and over
but_i digress
one black mark against this_place
they aren't open on mondays
it's monday today and_i'd kill for_some_indian for_dinner so_that totally sucks
anywhere that_isn't open days a_week really needs_to reevaluate
fortunately i_can cook the_stuff at_home that's when_i have three hours to spare
summary
it's far_from the_best_indian_restaurant that_i've eaten_at
but it's_the_best in_phoenix that i've_found
admittedly
i_haven't_tried anything on_the_east side yet
when we_are_in the_mood_for some north_indian style meat we head to_tandoori_times
i've_eaten at both tandoori_times locations and_both are_delicious
my_only complaints are that_some of_the_dishes are_a_little heavy on_the oil but that_can_be typical for_some indian_places especially those that_are more pakistani in nature and they_do_not offer much_of a_vegetarian selection
we taken family_and friends to_this_restaurant
some_of which have never_had_indian_food
with_great success
the_food_is generic enough_for the american palette but_still delicious for_those of us_that huff spices in_our spare time
i've yet to_try_their chaat on_the_weekends but_i'm dying to_do_so
time for_an update
and_i'm taking away a_star for_one reason
the_food_has remained delicious_and_the lunch_specials are priced right
the_lamb_vindaloo i_had there_on th july was_awesome
but_there's something_that pissed me right_off when_i ordered takeout recently
portion_size
it's dollars for_an oz container of_food
depending on what_you_get
get three different containers along with_rice_and_a naan_and you're almost at
that's way_too expensive
no matter how tasty the_food_is
i know_how_to make_this stuff
technically
although_i have problems achieving the flavour
and i_know_what the_ingredients cost
they're making money hand over dot at_this_place and the_final issue i_have is_that my oz container of chicken_makhani was_less than_half chicken and_the_rest sauce
see my tandoori village review_for more information on_this
they_need to knock their_prices way down
i_want a_take_out meal_for two and_i want it_to_be under thirty bucks
when i_can_get three pounds of chinese_food for_under
see my review_of chen wok in surprise
paying double that for_less food doesn't strike me as_a particularly_good deal
don't anyone make_the mistake that this_place_is haute cuisine either
it ain't gaylords
not by a_long shot
and gaylords is_pretty far_from haute cuisine itself
my vote for favorite_indian_food goes to tandori times
the_food_is_great
the_restaurant_has_a very cool atmosphere
the_wait_staff_is extremely_friendly
and_they_offer great daily specials
this locations is_definitely less crowded during_dinner time but_i'd eat_at tandori times any_time
i_am sad_to say i_have_to change my original rating for tandori times
not once but twice while dining with_friends my debit card was swiped for not_only my_bill but my_friends bill as_well
the_first_time the_problem was taken_care of quickly
the_second_time i_got_the run around before they_took care_of the_problem
i_have_been hesitant to_go_back to tandori times_since this happened and_will never_go_back without cash
i_was greatly impressed
my_mom and i_went_here a_little after they_opened for_dinner_and it_was_absolutely wonderful
we_both are
kind of
experienced with_indian_food
but not_really
so_it_was really_great to_have_a server who_was intelligent
patient
and genuinely nice
the_restaurant_was very open
colorful
and_comfortable
the_food_was_delicious
my_mom had_plenty_of meat eating options and_i_had plenty_of_vegetarian options
hint
skip the salads and appetizers to_have room for_dessert
the_rice_pudding is cool and_refreshing and not_like any_other rice_pudding i've ever_had
expect_to_pay about bucks for whatever main_dish you_order and_everything else_is awesomely inexpensive
like bucks or_so for sides and_desserts
i_absolutely loved_this_place
it_is_good food_for_the die hards and_good_service for the_new
shy foodies who_are just getting into indian_cuisine
we_have never_tried_indian_food before
when_we_went we_had_a waiter that explained everything to_us
the_food_was_great
i_forgot alot_of the_names_of the_dishes_we had
but_i do_love the_garlic_naan they_serve
also i_have_been back for_lunch takeout and_order the_tandoori_chicken wrap
it_was_delicious
i_also love_their chai_tea
wandered in here_for_lunch with my_wife
i_had_the lamb_vindaloo_and she_had the_vegetable_korma
it_was_the_best vindaloo i've_had_in years_and teh service_was_pretty damn_good too
oh_my god
was this_a win or what
i_enjoy spice_and indian_food a_lot
but i'm_always nervous about cleanliness and getting an explosive asshole later in the_evening
however
my_experience at_tandoori_times left_me with_no worries
a_belly full_of lamb boti masala_and flying horse beer
as_soon_as_we walked_in i_was addicted to the_smell
curry permeated my clothes as_i began_to salivate
the_waitress_was knowledgeable about_the dishes_and helped in_my selection process
the_side_of rice_for
was_huge
it disappointed me_that they_didn't serve_the rice_with the_dish
but_it_was worth_the
we_had_a free cup_of chai_tea to_top of_our_meal
i_will_definitely_be coming back
i'm addicted
i_work very_close_to this_restaurant
i_have_eaten here_many
many_times
the_service_is not always the_best but the_food_has always_been excellent
in_my_opinion the_food_is much better_than_the maharaja palace
i_can honestly say_that i_have_never_had a_bad_meal here
i_also work with many_people from_india and they_all love the_place
to_me that_is a_good_sign
the_only down side i_have_ever seen here is_the_service
like one_of_the reviewers said before
i_have_had issues with being charged wrong
etc
i_would_recommend it_for anyone that loves indian_food like_i do
good atmosphere
average_food
but a_lot to_worry about_as far_as menu other policies is concerned
food_is consistent
bread_is above_average
and prices_are within normal range for phoenix
why are the_traditional appetizers available only on saturday and sunday
and_only between
and
vegetable pakorka
samosa
chole poori
and_more
only available on days a_week
why
this_is crazy
closed mondays
common to_be closed entirely for private parties
or they switch to take_out only because_of private parties
aloo mattar is_a lunch_special
another dish
eggplant
is_a lunch_special
neither one is_on_the regular_menu
and_it_is hit and miss with whether or_not the_evening chef can_make them
there_is little difference between medium
medium hot
and_hot
if_you_order extra hot
chef's hot
there's a_huge jump
they just_can't get_it right
minutes
nobody acknowledges i'm here
it's
and_the_restaurant isn't_that busy
servers
both_of which pass me several_times
and_no greeting
no menu
no water
just flat out ignored
other patrons started_to notice i_was being ignored
even_after hand gestures to_get attention
when_the server's casual conversation started_with_the adjacent table i_had_to get up_and just leave
unbelievable
this_was_my second_visit
and to_be_honest
i'm_not someone that eats indian_food very_much
this_time i_went_with_a party_of many of_them are from_india
this time_around i_opted_for_the seekh kabob lamb
which_was mostly meat_on a_plate_of onions_and peppers
i_really wished that bread or ngo would_have come_with it
but_i resolved that pretty quick with another order
my co diners were_very_good
they helped explain other items_on_the_menu to_me_and help me pick out future dishes
overall the_food_is_very_good and_very ethnic
the_service struggled not_only with_our larger party but_the lunch rush
if_you_like_indian_food or want to_try_it
i_would_suggest andoori times
the_tastiest indian_cuisine i've_had_in_a very_long time
and the_waitstaff was friendly_and_attentive
the_chef knows how_to temper the_spices to_your liking
the lamb_tikka_masala is_a_must have
i_wish_the rice_and_the naan_bread came_with_the entrees
though
they have_to_be ordered separately
this place_is_pretty damn_good
even_though_it was_busy
we_never had_to_ask_for more to_drink or pretty much anything
they_got an_extra star_for_the service
as for_the_food
it_was_pretty traditional
i didn't_see anything on_the_menu_that jumped out_as a_restaurant specialty
that's a_shame because i'm_always looking_for new_things to_try
i_ended_up getting the_chicken_vindaloo
i_would_have preferred mine to_be a_bit_more spicy_but the_waiter said_that i_can request extra_spicy the_next_time
i_am_a regular at this_spot
past two visits the_food_quality was poor
yesterday their relish was stale
the_quality_and service_has dropped significantly in past months or_so
for_the_price
this_is_a_great great_indian place_for_lunch
for
you_can_get_a great lunch_special
naan
rice
salad
entree
the_curries_are very_well made_and the_naan_is hot out the_oven
i_love_it here
yummy indian_food
much better_than nearby taj_mahal
a_little_pricey but offers indian_food_in a location where it_is often hard_to find
love carrry out
really quick
the_food_was_good
don't_get_me_wrong
but_the after affect is_what turn me down
tandoori_times used oils with trans fat to_cook their foods
i_would_like_to support the_local business
but trans fat should be banned in_arizona
this_place_has the_best tandoori_chicken that_i_have ever_tasted
it_is_so flavorful
they_also have tandoori spicy chicken_wings that i_recommend
i_have_never_had problems with their_service like some_of_the_other reviewers
some might think it_is_a_bit pricey_but my motto is_that you_can't put_a price on good_food
i_love_their garlic_naan
their chicken_saag is also_very_good
everything i_have_ordered here has either met or exceeded my expectation
the_menu_is ala cart so if_you_want rice then you_need_to order it_on_the side but they_give_you_a lot
whether you_have never_tried_indian_food or quite the connesuir this_place_will definitely_be a_delight for_you
each_time_i have_been_here the_food_has been_great and_service has_been on_top_of their game as_well
prices_are_reasonable and_can cater_to large parties or_even children
it's located_in_a newer looking strip_mall on bell rd near arrowhead
the
chains
are all_around but_this_place stands out_from some of_those other meager places
the_inside is_clean_and nicely_decorated in_indian decor as expected
i_will_be_back and think others should check the_place out as_well
note
i_have_only been_here once as_my fiance isn't a_big_fan_of indian_food
but i_have_been day dreaming about_it ever_since
my_friend i grabbed lunch_here on_a_friday afternoon
considering we_went during what would normally be considered the
lunch rush
i_was_surprised that it_wasn't more crowded
but
she_had raved_about their lunch_specials so_i was_excited_to_try tt out
we_were quickly greeted with ice water and_offered fresh brewed chai
our_waiter_was great
while he_was new
he had_just started a_week before
but was_friendly
knowledgeable and_seemed super enthusiastic about_the_food
we_decided_to split an_order_of samosas to_start
wow
best samosas that_i_have had_ever
the_outside was cooked_perfectly
soft but crispy_and warm
the filling of potatoes_and peas was_creamy and_spiced perfectly
they_were served_with_a garbanzo masala chutney that was_out_of_this_world
seriously i_could_have eaten the_chutney with_a spoon
my_friend had_the_lamb_vindaloo which_is_the special on_friday
so she_was served her main course
a_salad
rice_and_naan
this_is_the dish she_had raved to_me about
and_she seemed_to be equally pleased with_it the_day_we went
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala and it_didn't disappoint
the_chicken was_tender_and the_sauce_was wonderfully creamy with just_enough heat
i_also_ordered a_side_of chili naan
it_was huge way too_much_for one_person
but was_so_delicious i_wanted_to eat the_whole order
i_will_be_back
and
while i_would_like_to say_that i_will_try other_dishes
it_will_be hard_to pull myself away_from_the samosas
and_the_chicken_tikka_masala
seriously
check_this_place out
food_is_awesome
so_i_have never_eaten alot_of indian_food
but friends of ours suggested dinner_there so_we_went
i_am_so glad_i_did
talk_about delish
the chicken_saag was_one_of_the_best things i_have_ever eaten
prices_are_reasonable
service_is so_so and_the_food yummo
we_had chicken_saag
chicken_tikki_masala
fish masala
garlic_naan_and rice
the four_of us left stuffed_and happy
it_was_so_good
i_went_back the_following week for_lunch only_to discover some terrific lunch_specials
bucks for_more lunch then you_can_eat
all_i_can say_is
go
only_been here_once but thought it_was_very_good
will_return next_time in_the_area_and looking_for_indian
we_had a_party_of on_a_friday_night
happy birthday
g
some of_us has had_indian_food and_the_other half was_in for_an adventure
got_there in time_for happy_hour
i_ordered_the spicy chicken_wings mild
my_mouth was_on fire
too spicy_for_me
but they_were_good
the garilc nan_was so goooood
i_got_the_chicken tandoori wrap
yum
they_made it_with less spicy_for_me
yes
i_am_a whimp
in_the_middle_of dinner
the_music got louder
we_were_not sure_what is going_on but_then out_of no where there_was a_belly_dancer
she_is shaking and moving all_over_the resturant
the_kids loved_it
they went out_to dance with the_belly_dancer
so of_our adults too
it_was_a fun filled events and the_food_was_good
my_husband loves indian_food
so we_stopped by for_lunch since_we_were on bell road already
i_had_to order the_chicken_tandoori wrap again
it_was_good and_the_naan_was just fluffy enough
my_husband_ordered the daily special
beef stew
garlic_naan extra
and comes with_rice
the daily special was_awesome
we_had great_service_and the_waiter_was good to_look_at too
great_food
good scenery
i_am one happy woman
better_than we expected
we_stopped_in fairly late on tuesday night_and it_was_still quite busy
there_were three_of us_and we_ordered_the lamb_vindaloo
a_lamb special
sag paneer_and naan
we_requested them
chef spicy
which our charming waitress informed us_was as hot as it_gets
we_were delighted to discover that_this_was actually quite_spicy
both lamb_dishes were_excellent
the_naan_was fresh_and_hot from_the oven
my_only quibble was_with the_saag_paneer which_was heavy on_the saag_and light on the_paneer
but_still pretty_good
it's a_bit_pricey for_a neighborhood indian_joint about for_the three_of us_with one beer
but it's_also a_bit nicer than the_typical indian_restaurant
service_was_friendly_and efficient
we'll be_back
what_a_great unexpected surprise of delicious_indian_food in_my hood
we didn't_get to_do too_much research on indian_restaurants that_night and since_there are_not many great indian_restaurants_in central and north phoenix
i_didn't_feel compelled to_put in_the effort
learned helplessness you_can say
after driving around before our movie
we_found_this wonderful restaurant and_will_be coming_back_for more
tandoori_times has_great ambiance with fun indian art on_the_wall
our servers_were very_pleasant and_you_can tell they_were happy working_there
we_tried_the lamb briyani
saag_paneer
and chili naan
although they had_some innovative and creative indian_dishes we_decided_to stick_with more traditional dishes
the_saag had_a slightly more watery consistency than_what i_am_used_to but the_taste_was incredible
the_lamb briyani was light_and not_so oily like_other briyani dishes
my_favorite_was_the chili naan
which_was light
fluffy
and_tasted awesome baked with chilies and cilantro
their side
condiments
was unique
which_included a mixture_of pickled chopped ginger
lemon
garlic and_other spices
we_were so_glad to_have tried this_restaurant_and hope_to be_back_to_try their other_dishes
this_is_the_best_indian_food that i_have_ever_had in_arizona
maybe even_in the_entire united states
the_chicken_tikka_masala is_to_die_for
i'm_used_to indian_food_in london
and anyone who's eaten_indian in_london knows that_indian out_here doesn't even compare
but this_place_is absolutely_amazing
my mother
who_is indian and_a snob when_it_comes_to indian_food
surprisingly loved_this_place
whenever_i tell her i'm_going_to tandori times she_is very_very jealous
the_staff_is nice
service_is_good
havent been_there when_the bellydancer is_there
which_would kind of irritate me
only_thing i_didn't_like was_that one_of_the waitresses didn't speak english
which_was odd seeing as_she was a_server
i_was just asking_for a_take away box and it_seemed too_much_for her_to handle
decent prices
a_bit_pricey compared_to thai or pizza or_something
but_its well_worth_it
apart from the_chicken_tikka_masala
that i_order everytime_i go
the_eggplant dish_is also_very_good
as_well_as_the lentils and_the_garlic_naan
this_place_is_a must
i_have_been in_this neighborhood for a_week from calif
could'nt find a_good independent place_to_eat untill i_drove past this indian_bistro
it_is similar_to chaat cafe in fremont ca
very_pleasant interior
food_was_great
crew seemed_very disorganized and inexperienced
need basic customer_service training
customers were_waiting for_a_long_time before some one seated them
one almost spilled water on_me
one hand did_not know what the_other was_doing
i_still will recommend_this_place
just bear the inexperienced crew in the_dining_area
i_will visit_this_place again
due_to_the terrible_service we experienced
i_should give_this_place star but the_food_was_delicious so i'm_giving it_stars
four_of us went_here on_our lunch break
note to self and others
do_not go_to_this_place if_you_are pressed for time
our_waitress had_no_idea what she_was doing and messed up of_the orders at our_table
we_were never offered anything to_drink besides water_and had_to_ask several time_for plates once our food_arrived
and trying_to separate our payment was_simply too_much_for her_to handle
i_will_say my chicken_tikka_masala was_absolutely_delicious and is_one_of_the_best i_have_had_in arizona
they_do charge extra_for rice
which_i find odd
the_best_part_of ordering indian_food_is pouring the_sauce over_rice
the naan_was_excellent too
the terrible_service and_extremely long_wait time for_our_food as_well as our_check was unacceptable
so i_don't_see us going back
i_love_this_place
best_indian_food around here
and the_most awesome free_chai ever
my_favorites here_are the_mango_lassi
the_garlic_naan_and the_chicken_makhani
and_i pretty much order the_same_thing every single time
but at_times when_i'm feeling adventurous
i go_for_the goan fish_curry
probably the_only time i'll touch fish in non sushi form
or the_chicken_biryani
they_have_a big menu to_choose_from_and the_food_is as authentic as it_gets
they_do tone the spice_levels down quite_a_bit though which might_be_a good_or bad_thing depending on how_spicy you like_your food_to_be
i_love_this_place and_take all_my non_indian friends here whenever they crave indian_food
i'd vouch for it's awesomeness any day
it ok_but not_great and_service_is so_so
my_fav is the_chicken_tikka_masala_and their seasoned rice
their samosas choley is_good w the_red sauce
i_will work for_this stuff
frequneter
the gal that_serves us water is_super fast and_efficient
my_fav server is suaznne
sp
she's fast
outgoing
friendly
gets stuff done
chicken_tikka_masala
seasoned rice
samosas choley
i blow my paycheque here cuz the_stuff i_order above is yumminess
i_like_the open atmosphere of_this_place
they_got belly_dancing performances
dancer walks around shaking it while you_eat
fridays
pm ish
just remember they are_closed mondays
and_have specific operating times for_lunch
i_think noon to
the_staff_are very_friendly here
but the_chicken_tikka_masala has gone downhill since_i last posted my_review
it_got a_lot_more runny watery_and lacks the_flavor it_used_to have
kind of disappointed bc it_was_my weekly fav dish
this has_to_be one_of_the_best_indian_restaurants i've_been_to internationally
they've nailed a_lot_of dishes down perfectly to_that
restaurant style indian_food_for america
type_of cuisine
i've_been_here times_now_and the_food_has consistently been good
which_is a_good_sign
and_i'm referring to the_location near th something street and bell
there_is another one i've heard is not_as_good_as this_place with the_same name
i've tried the_tandoor chicken
lamb_tikka_masala
karahi chicken_and chicken_makhani
the_naan is_really_good too
the_free_chai is_the icing on_the cake
their meat_is really always juicy and_tender
barely ever dry like_it is_at so_many other_indian_restaurants
i'm_very apprehensive about eating_at of_indian_restaurants anyway
as_most re use other people's food
over undercook things
or grossly underflavor things
we've_had the_same waitress all times
i'll agree
the service_from her end could really use some major improvement
but
indian_restaurants in_general are far_from perfect
and_some leeway is required
would_definitely eat_here again
even if_i_were disappointed at least once
agree the_tikka_masala has gone a_little thin in_the_past few_months
will only go here_on_a lunch_hour so_i_can order_the special_and get_a_good value
last trip people had lunch and_a had_a glass_of_wine and_it_was since everyone ordered ala_carte too steep for_the_amount_of_food you_get
i dined here_for_the very first_time last_night
so_i_can not comment on_the consistency of_the_food or service
just my one_time experience
we_were immediately greeted_and seated when_we_arrived
and when_the gentlemen found_out that_we_had not_been there_before he_told us all_about_the weekend experience_with the_belly_dancing
and hookah
he_also told_us to make_reservations for_the weekends
cause they_do get very_busy
our_waiter_was very_nice
and_offered up_some great_suggestions for noobs like us
this_was only my nd time eating_indian_food
we_ended_up ordering_the chicken_tikki_masala
and_the coconut_chicken w rice
the food_arrived reasonably quickly
and neither dish_was runny at_all like other_reviews point_out
everything_was hot
and_delicious
and_there_was enough left_over for probably meal
it_did take awhile for our_server to_get_our check to_us
but he_was_very aware cause when he_brought our_check he_also brought some complimentary ice_cream as_an apology and_a thank_you for_our patience
over_all i_had_a great_experience at_this_restaurant and wish it hadn't taken us so_long to_try
we_will_be_back
this_is the_first_time_i have eaten_indian_food
so i_would_not be_able_to say if it_is_the_best around
here is_what_i do know
i_had_the_lamb tikka_marsala
it_was_very_good and they_brought the_chutneys on_the side so_i_could adjust the_heat according_to my_own white boy whimpy palate
the_service_was_good and_i_will be_back_to_try other_things to expand my culinary boundaries
we_are north indians and know our north_indian restaurant food well
we've been_going here from a_long_time now
we_love the_food_here
earlier was a_mix_of dine_in and_take out_as the_belly_dancer is annoying
it_is for bachelor's to_come drink
look enjoy but most families cannot tolerate it
seriously she knows a squat about_the songs she_is dancing on
and they_all are kinda old bollywood songs they dont update themselves music wise
but_i really appreciate her trying_to make a_good_time for evreyone
we_went once in_an afternoon
and_decided_to order some snack items like chhole bhature
it_was horrible as_the oil was swimming on_it and i_could_not eat_it
i_know it_is_a fried item but the_cook should at least try_to pat it dry
but_no
he wanted us to_have_the oil
anyways that_is why we stick_to our_main course
since we_had our baby we_only take_out but_not very often
but yes no doubt the_food_is_good
we_love paneer
malai_kofta
chili paneer
paneer tandoori
which_is actually called paneer_tikka in_india
the dal_makhani is sort of_a make or break for_an_indian_restaurant in_india and_every restaurant_has_a chef who only makes dal_makhani for_them
yes its that important
they cannot get_it right
they_put chana dal in dal_makhani
really
when_i make_it at_home i make_it better_than them
yes i_do
tasty_food
decent prices_and quick_service
i_especially like the_chilli naan_and malai_kofta here
summary
without claiming to_be_the arizona's foremost expert_on_indian cuisine or
in_fact
even knowing what the_hell i'm talking about
this_is_my_favorite indian_food_restaurant
the_rice_is never sticky
the_naan_is always perfectly toasted and sacrilegiously tossing chicken_tikka_masala atop the two_of 'em completes an_excellent naan taco
this_review_is pretty much giving that combination_of items along_with the_chicken_tikka wrap stars
i certainly can't vouch for the_whole menu
pricing
the
chicken_tikka wrap on_the lunch_menu is_delicious
lunch service_is prompt
dinner prices_and portions_are average
indian_food seems_to always be in_the range minimum
concerns
if you're thinking_about coming_here on_a_friday or saturday
you_may want_to consider calling ahead to_find_out if you're_going_to be subjected to shiva's meal tarnishing minions
the belly_dancers
along_with_the accompanying db indian techno soundtrack
it_only happened_to me once_and
thank vishnu
i_was signing the_bill at_the_time
loved_the_food or_maybe it_was_the hours of non stop driving that precipitated this
in_any case
service_was_attentive
although_we went at nearly closing time
food_was hot and_tasty
not_much to complain about
i would_definitely_recommend_this_place to_anyone_looking_for good_indian_food
awesome service
very_nice waitress
and_really comfortable and_clean interior
but_the_food leaves a_little something to_be_desired
it_seemed_like everyone at_the_restaurant enjoyed_it
but_i_found the_food_to_be quite plain_and probably watered_down for_the locals
very high prices for_indian_food as_well
maybe it's_just_not my_taste
but if_you_go home without any stomach pains
it probably wasn't real indian_food
not_much i_can_say other_than this_place_is_good and_tandoori village is awful
i_had_the_lamb curry
and_my_wife had_the_chicken_tikka_masala
it_was_all wonderful
i_wouldn't order_the paneer_pakora again but_that's ok
it'll save us some money
like_i said
really_really_good
the_food_is totally terrible
me being from_india
i_expected a_bit_more from this_restaurant
but looks like the_chef just forgot how_to put_out a_good dish
i_ordered_a paneer saag which_was bland
watery_and lacked any flavor what so ever
the_paneer_was old_and fragmented
distasteful and above all
it_was stale
i_would_never pay_for a_dish and_get stale food
the soda had_no fizz and wasnt cold enough
the_music_was so loud that i_had_to shout if_i_had to_talk_to my_wife sitting across the_table from_me
the_ambience_is poor and_the lighting is_so dull that_it resembles more_like_a whore house rather than a_restaurant
i_am never going_back_to this_restaurant or_any of_its other locations
the_food_is utter boring and_would suit a palette which_has no taste_of spices
disappointing
everytime_i come_here i remind myself to_put it higher on my_list
ya the_decor_is kinda kitchy
the_food_is quite_good
that_is why you_go to restaurant isn't it
there_is naan_is spot_on and_the_lamb dishes simply rock
puts the greek places_to shame
i_have my_favorites but have_never anything here that_i_would put_in the_bad column
authentic works here
this_is_one_of_the better_places to_go_for indian_food
i_have_only had_the_lunch items at_this_place
i_usually_go with either the_chicken or lamb lunch_special
it's_pretty clean_and service_was_good for_a busy lunch_time
i hear they_have_a belly_dancer on_friday evenings
work in_the_area
so i've stopped by with coworkers countless times
the_service_has been bad out_of times
but_the_food_is some_of_the_best_indian_food in_town
lunch_specials are really_good_and the_happy_hour is_great
so until now_i just put up_with it
until today
when i_tried_to call in an_order and_they hung up_on me
three_times
literally just clicked the button to_end the call without even picking_up
and left_me in_a confused silence i_had full bars
i_hope it_was_just a phone problem
but honestly
it_didn't seem that_way
also
splitting a check here_is an absolute nightmare
they write all_the checks by hand and refuse to_get_some form_of electronic system
i understand that splitting a check ways is crazy
but_there's only typically of_us
depending on who waits on you
they_will throw a fit when_you ask to split the_bill
the saving grace though
is there's one waiter who's always really_good_and will_do it for_us no problem
everytime we_go
we pray that we_get placed in_his section
haha
honestly i_can't_say i_won't come_back
because there_isn't much else in_the_area_and the_food_itself is_really_good
but don't_expect any form_of hospitality
and_don't bother during full price hours
the_dinner prices aren't work this
i'm_not_a fancy restaurant type_of person
i_don't require top_notch service
but_i'd at least like_to not wait minutes_for food during_my lunch_hour
then another for the_waitress to_bring the_bill
and_have her get angry at_us for trying_to pay the damn bill
i_absolutely_love the_food_here
everything_is cooked_and seasoned to_perfection
the_service_is sometimes a_little_slow
but_i go_for_dinner and_don't mind since the_food_is_so delicious
the_naan is_so_good
and_the_tandoori wraps are_amazing
in_short
very_very tasty_indian non_veg food
service is_ok
pricing is_a_little to_the higher side
tandoori_chicken_is well_cooked
lamb_biryani is_my_favorite
chicken_biryani is_excellent
i'm_a_fan of biryani
s
yes
the_naan is_good_and chicken_masala is the_perfect side
do_not try_out veggie curries here
mostly they_are_not well_cooked or seasoned
staff is_ok
service is_a_little delayed
but understandable
i've been_there only_for dinners and the_ambience looks intimate
somedays they_have_a belly_dancer
well she's good_with bollywood songs too
they_seem to_have_some happy hours and lunch_time discounts
but_i've tried out only dinners and_the pricing is_a_little to_the higher side
bottom_line
tasty_food
need_to carry a heavy valet
suitable if_you_are planning to impress someone
i rate this_place_a
my_wife_and_i eat_here often because_we love_the_food
particularly their lamb_dishes
the_lamb kebabs are terrific and_the lamb_tikka_masala is_one_of_the tastiest dishes i've_had anywhere
they_make great_naan
the chile and_potato varieties are the_real standouts
the onion_bhaji is_also_a must
a word_of caution
stay away friday and_saturday nights if_you_don't_like belly_dancing
having some proto stripper clang loud zills
finger symbols
in_my ear while_i try to_eat does nothing for_me
nothing good_at least
also
belly_dancing is of mid eastern origin so_i have_no_idea why it_would_be featured at_an_indian_restaurant
if i_wanted_to watch a stripper
i'd prefer to_do_so the_old fashioned way
at_a club of ill repute
in_the dark
where the_staff and_i_can both veil our combined sense humiliation and degradation
also be_on_the lookout for the_owner
be_prepared for endless conversation if he's there_and drinking
i'll will_be_returning to_tandoori_times often
but_i'll be hiding out
averting my_eyes and leaving my handful_of singles at_home
so_delicious
the_amazing spices_are going_to haunt my dreams
unlimited chai
mango_lassi
matter_paneer and_garlic_naan
i_almost died
stole some_of_my boyfriend's raita that_came_with his lamb_biryani
which_was enough_to feed two hungry people very happily
since_my matter_paneer was_so deliciously spicy
we_were one of_two guests on_a_thursday night_and waited_for nothing
service_was amazing
our_server had great_suggestions for both_of_us
good_food
spicy
i_was sweating like_a wh
on quarter night
they_just need_to stay stocked better though
out_of two_of items we_ordered including rice puddin
they_serve one_of_the best tandoori_chicken in_the_valley
unlimited chai
service_is_good
if_you_are looking_for_a quiet dinner avoid fri
sat and sun
they_have belly_dancing and the_worst part_is they_put the_music so loud
the even its difficult for_the server_to hear you
this_place_is fantastic
i_loved_the chicken_tiki_masala
the_tandoori_chicken is_amazing
the_service_was_great even_when we_came_in close_to closing time
they_gave us great_food_and it tasted_great
i'm_so disappointed in_the decline of this_restaurant
i once loved_the_food here
but my_last experience_was so bad that i_haven't_been back
we_came for_lunch and_the_place_was nearly empty
that should_have alerted me
normally it_was at least half_full a_few_minutes after opening
we_ordered
i'd brought a_friend_who loved indian_food_and hadn't discovered_this_place
she_was very_excited about coming and the_free_chai
after_ordering we walked over_to the_chai station and drew two cups
ugh
it_was watery
milky and bitter
it_tasted old_and not_at_all up_to their normal standard
i_mentioned the poor quality to the_server
who_was really trying_to be helpful
i_even went over and_got her a_cup and_she couldn't drink it
she went_to_the back_and come_out and_said
the cook's don't_want_to make_a fresh batch
whaaa
so_we dumped the_chai and_waited for_our_food
i_ordered_the_chicken tandoori with_garlic_naan and_my_friend had_the_chicken_tikka salad_and we_waited
and_waited
and_waited
you_could hear arguing for the_kitchen
not a_good_sign
the_server avoided us
after minutes i_called her over
she said the_food for coming
i drank a_lot_of water while_waiting so off_to the_bathroom and_on my_way i pass a staff member leaning over_a counter eating his lunch
they just_opened
they_had customers
when_the_food finally arrived it_is
meh
not the_quality i_was accustomed_to and_not_the place i'd bring anyone else for_sure
this visit was_on march
i_haven't_been back since to a_place_that was once a_regular once a_month stop
oh_yeah
and_my_friend hasn't been_back either
i honestly think it_has_a big management problem
this_place_is fantastic
it_is_a_bit of a_hidden_gem
not easily seen from the_road
we_got_the chicken_tikka_masala
wonderful
and_the curried chicken_which i_have dubbed the_best_i've_ever_had
we also_got the_naan basket which_is several different flavors_of naan
we_will_definitely_be going back
food_was_amazing
service_was fantastic
if you_know indian_food then you_can tell upon entering that_this_is the_real deal
these people know_how_to cook and_are proud of_it
i_saw somebody using what looked to_be the_size_of a boat oar in_a pot almost big enough_to get_in and_it smelled like heaven
i sometimes just order the_naan_bread on_my way_home to accompany a_salad
it_is like bucks and_the_best in_town
you_can close your eyes and_pick anything off_the_menu and you_will_not_be_disappointed
me_and the_wife were in_the_mood for_something different
indian_food_was something different for_us so_we yelped something indian_and this_spot popped up
so_we entered and_were greeted_by_the waitress
nice little_place
i_look around_and the_atmosphere_is_nice
theres a_few families in_there
some_people at_the_bar
your usual nice_atmosphere
we really_wanted some authentic_indian_food
and_as far_as i_can tell
i_think_we found_it
because we_had_no experience_with authentic_indian_food
i_had to_give_it the
authenticity test
here's the test
when you_want to_find_out how authentic_and ethnic restaurant_is
you look_at how ethnic its population is
this_restaurant passed the test
it was_very_nice_and refreshing to_see_the diversity in_this_place
we proceeded_to look very lost and confused about_their huge_menu so_i_asked the_waitress for help because_we_were clueless to_the lingo on_the_menu_and she_was really cool about_it
she explained what everything_was
and_how you pair it
we began with the_samosas
a pastry filled_with potato_and green peas
with garbanzo beans on_the side
served_with three different chutnies
a green one
a_red one
and_then some pickled stuff there_was ginger in_there for_sure
the_samosa was_really_good
but_i gotta say_the garbanzos were freakin delicious
it_was freakin' good
all_of_it
then we_ordered_the chicken_tikki_masala
with_some rice_and_naan
the_whole thing_was gone
i_guess the_best_thing i_can_say is that_this_place from_the sounds of it_seems very_authentic
the_food_is_good
and the_server_was cool
the_only_thing_that i_felt awkward about was around
a_belly_dancer came out and_i honestly didn't know_what_to do
i_had_my pregnant wife sitting next_to me while this girl is doing her thing
didn't_really know_the etiquette
i reached for_a dollar
then realized i_was_in_the wrong place
then everybody else started_to take_out dollars
so then_i got confused
it_was_a weird dynamic
didn't know_where to_look
like
if_i looked did_i look_like a pervert
i_mean there's families around
but_at the_same_time i_think_i was_supposed_to
so from_the looks of_it
you give her a dollar
but_then she'll stand you_up and make_you dance with_her
take what_you will from_this
go_there it_was_a cool experience
i_went about a_year_ago because_of a_groupon
we_had just moved_to the_valley and_were jonesing for some_indian_food
this_place_had some pretty_good reviews so_we took_our groupon_and checked it_out
the_atmosphere_is really_nice
it_is upscale and_has_a nice_decor
it_is different_than a_lot_of_the more run down indian_places i_have_been_to
anyways
thank god we had_a_groupon
this_place_was so expensive
i_have_had indian_food_in different parts of the_world
germany
california
kentucky
and georgia
and_was shocked at the_prices
plus here
and_other valley indian_places
you have_to_pay for_rice
why do_i have_to_pay for_rice
how am_i supposed_to eat_this liquid delishness without_a semi solid medium to_bring to my_mouth
i_know its only dollars
but_its the principle
just give_me rice
and keep_it coming
don't nickle dime your customers
i_was already paying dollars for an_entree
the_food_was_really_good
i enjoyed_it
i_had_my usual of_paneer tike masala_and it_was_perfect
husband_had chicken_vindaloo and liked_it
he is_a hot_and spicey lover
and like_most restaurants it_did_not quite bring the_heat
he wants_to enjoy his meal_with tears streaming down his face and_his sinuses cleared for_the_next year
this_place while flavorful
did_not bring the_heat he so desperately is searching_for
we_also shared some_naan
and i_don't_really remember if_it_was good_or bad
so_i_guess it was_just_ok
so_i liked this_place
but will_i be_back
no probably_not
its just_too rich for_my blood
i_am still on_the hunt for_spicy
delicious_indian_food that_is cheap in_the_valley
anybody know_where i_can_get some
we_are regulars here
any place_that my year old daughter will_go to that_doesn't have_an indoor playground must_be good
love_the_chicken tika_masala
spiced to_order
last few_times we_went
they_did_not have_the 'flying horse royal lager'
which_is_a bummer
would_give stars_if they_didn't 'nickle and dime' you over_the rice_and_naan should be included with_an entre
i had_dinner weeks_ago with my_friend this_restaurant
food_is all tasty_but price was_kind_of expensive for_us
we_ordered
marsala chicken half size
or small chicken
and kinds_of curry
very_small
n kinds_of naan_bread
was looks really small
we_paid bucks tips
surprisingly good_indian_food in_the_middle_of_the desert
we_went with_a_group and_while the_service_was_a tad slow for an_empty restaurant
the_portions and_flavors did_not_disappoint
the_location_is a_bit hidden in_a_strip_mall
but_don't let that deter you
i personally enjoyed the_variety_of the_naan they_offered and will_be_back
may i_say i_have_been here_a_few_times before_and i_don't_think i_would_have given_a
maybe_a
or at_times
they_do get points for_the delicious free_chai
though
this_time
the company made all the_difference
i_went with_a_group_of coworkers friends from_india
i_arrived late and_they_had already ordered
we_usually eat family_style
which i_love
what_a_great surprise their choices were
we_first got different_dishes
all dry
one chicken
one fish_and one i_believe was lamb
that last one looks to_me like sausage hamburger meat consistency
i_need_to learn my names
then we_got rice
white and saffron
and biryani
plus dishes_with reddish sauce
fish
chicken and_shrimp
plus baskets of_naan
i_think only the_naan in the_top was garlic_and the_ones at the_bottom were plain
but_they_were still very_good
also
i_asked_for some butter to_eat with_a piece_of_naan an they brought_me what seemed_to be real
rich
flavorful butter
yum
plus
let me say it_again
the_free_chai
delicious chai
well
if_you_don't take sugar you_may want_to take your_own sweetener because_they only_have sugar and sweet'n low
of_course
the_service_was_very_good
and may i add that in_the_past we_have asked_for split checks and they_don't seem_to frown about_it
most authentic_indian_food outside of_india
i_know
because i've been
don't_let_the idea_of exotic food scare you away
there's something_for everyone here
even vegetarians_and children
try the_paneer
pressed cheese
dishes or samosas choley if_you_don't_like meat
try_the_chicken or paneer makhani if_you_don't_like the_heat
for medium_spicy dishes
the_chicken_tikka_masala_is excellent with_a_side_of rice_and_naan bread
if_you_want_a bite of_something that'll bite you back_with a_really great_flavor
try the_tandoor fish wrap
the key to_eating reasonably is to_go as a_group_of or_more
get rice_and_naan and_a_couple different_items to_share with the_entire table
you_don't_have to_drink alcohol
but_there's a_full service bar at all_of_the tandoori_times locations and_the beer_selection is above_average
this_is_the nd of_the locations and features a nice_inside area with_a squishy
but comfortable patio where you_can enjoy hookah while you_eat
bellydancers join the fun on_friday and_saturday nights
decent value if you crave very_good quality_food
an exotic atmosphere_and an_authentic_indian experience
ok
the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic
but it's_definitely exciting
one_of_my_favorite weekend hangouts
solid out_of
i'm_giving them an_extra star_for their lunch_specials which_is an incredible value for_the_amount_of_food that_you_get
this is_my_favorite_indian_restaurant in_the_area
it's right_next_to school
favorites include achari lamb
mmm so_flavorful with_no hint_of gaminess
and_the lunch portion will feed you_for several meals
i've also had_the_chicken_tikka_masala which_was_good and chicken_biryani which_came_with a_huge side_of raita
yay
biryani_is the_food of_my people
bengalis
so_i_am very_picky when_it_comes_to it
i'd say tt s biryani satisfies my cravings
i_also love to_end my_meal with_their complimentary chai
watered_down some days
good other days
didn't_care_for the_chicken_tikka wrap lunch_special
thought_it_was too_dry
their_naan_is too doughy for_my_liking
i_prefer mine light and_a_little crispy
other_than_that i_have_no complaints thus far
their decor_is_nice
and their_dinner prices_are_pretty standard for_a_nice indian_restaurant
their red meat_is halal too
definitely will_be frequenting this_place
i_have visited_this restaurant multiple_times
mostly as_a part_of a large_party
greater than
and_i'm impressed at the_quality_of service
the_ambiance_is nice_and the_belly_dancing on_friday nights are pretty_good
people really get into_it
although it_does get loud due_to_the music
the_staff_is pretty friendly_and generally let you_know right away if something is_not available and suggests alternatives
i_have_found that some_of_the tables do_not_have the necessary spoon fork knife at_times and_the_staff does not bother to_check that
the_food_is generally good
but_i_have been_disappointed once by the_okra curry
bhindi_masala
it_was_not what_i expected
the_quantity of food_is_good_and for
we_usually end_up eating a_lot and_even taking some_food home
the_free_chai
tea
is_an added bonus
tandoori_times_is a_restaurant that_has reached a_new low among indian_restaurants servicing the_phoenix_area
i_was_there on friday_night last month to_pick_up lamb_biryani that i'd ordered through phone
having eaten some really_good
and bad
biryanis across many states
ca
tx
il
nc
fl etc
i_didn't expect great things here
especially after seeing_the reviews_on_yelp
but_i_still decided_to give_this_place_a benefit of doubt
and boy was_i in_for_a rude surprise
the_lamb_biryani
as this_place calls it
consisted_of a_few boiled lamb pieces thrown into rice_that was_already mixed_with some gravy
it absolutely had_no taste
flavor or_at least the looks to_pass of as biryani
it_was simply distasteful
i_was_so repulsed with_what i_got that i_felt_like going back_and asking the_cook which fool taught him to_make biryani like_this
this_place rightly deserves all_the negative feedback its been getting lately
i've advised all_my colleagues and friends never to_eat_here
lovely food
terrible_service
just entered for_lunch as the_second table of_the_day
got water immediately from water guy
waiter saw me_and started cleaning trays behind counter
mins later i_made eye contact with him again_and back_to cleaning trays he went
mins later i_left with water guy giving me_a 'sorry' look as_i exited
tasty lamb_dishes and the_garlic_naan_is addicting
will_be_back
i_love_their food but_i'm only giving stars because_of_the poor_service we_received today
our_table_was ignored for much of_the_meal
it took_forever_to get our_order taken
and_then when_the_food finally came out one_of_the meals was_missing and_the_server was_completely unapologetic
we_waited_for the_last meal to_come_out and we_saw it sitting under the_heat lamps while the_server_was at the_cash_register doing something else
finally one of_us got_up
walked over to_her
and_asked if that_was his_food
it_was his_food
and_again
she_was completely unapologetic
if i_could_have tipped less
i_would_have
but unfortunately gratuity was_already added because we_had people
well i have_to_admit that i_am_not a_fan_of_indian_food with_my bad experiences i've_had_in_the past
but those past memories started to_go deeper and deeper away when_i at here
hence my star_review
it reality should be
stars but_this_is my_first_time here_and i_don't_want_to waste 'stars on only_one try if possible
we_came on a_sunday_night about pm so a_little late
there_were still tables when we_sat and i_really_liked_the decor in_the_restaurant
we_ordered and were_greeted with great_service_and ordered thi chili prawns and curry_chicken
both came out fast_and hot
very_tasty
i'm not_a_big_fan_of indian_food
but tandoori was_very_good
that's a_lot seeing indian_food_is not my_first choice when_we go_out to_dinner
we_will_be_back here
i_really_like this_place
we_had very_good service
the_waitress_was friendly_and_helpful so we're the_other employees
i_ordered_the special beef dish can't think_of the_name now but_it_was_a bit_on_the spicy side which_i really_don't mind
this_dish came_with naan_bread_and a_delicious side salad oh_and rice
they_do_not skimp on rice
and fyi if_you_order it_as_a side you_will_get the_same amount as you_would if it_came_with the_special
i_decided_to upgrade the_bread to spicy and_that_was pretty_good too
if_you_are_not into_the spicy thing don't do_it or_even order the_beef special i_will edit the_review later when_i get the_name_of it
own the_beef was so_tender it_just melted in_my_mouth
i_was_very pleased that_i didn't_have_to chew meat for five hours or choke to death
please try the_tandoori shrimp appetizer it_is_the bomb
the_shrimp is very_tasty_and it_seems grilled it has_some char like_it_was
it lies on_a bed_of some grilled peppers_and onions
you_will receive a_few sauces with_your appetizers and_they_are very_good
one_is red one_is green and_the_other is_a pickled ginger kinda sauce
each one has their own unique flavors
so_it_is totally up_to your_own taste_buds
oh my_friend_ordered the tiki_masala dish and_that_was so_good
the_chicken was_cooked_to_perfection in_the beautiful curry_sauce
i_think_it's curry but_if_you eat_indian_food you_know_what i_am talking about
they_say most_of this food_has_been cooked_in clay ovens
that_is why it_has an original old school flavor
i_will tell you_that i_will_be_back
i_want_to try_the wraps
we seen this lady across from us tearing up_a wrap
and_i_am sold
more reviews to_come
excellent lamb_biryani
not_sure who wrote the opinion about_it being bad
i_come_here especially_for the_lamb_biryani and onion_naan
food_is stars
i_give overall stars_because the_food_and booze prices_are a_little_high for_my budget
but certainly_not unreasonable
hands_down_the best chicken_tikka in_phoenix
as_good as_a middle_of_the road restaurant_in england in_other words way better_than anywhere else i_have_found in_the_valley
highly_recommend you try_it
service_was_ok
tables etc are_a_bit downmarket
but_not offensive
food_was_fantastic had_the paneer_tikka_masala
service_was_great
never needed to_ask_for drink refills
nice_place not_too loud
the_food_here_is beyond bad
i've tried several things on_the_menu_and found all of_them to_be ridiculously terrible
i'm_really confused where these positive_reviews come from
i_would_have_to assume its people who've never_had english indian_food_before
which_is definitely possible in glendale arizona
but_this_place should be ashamed
it's certainly_not saved by at service either
no specifics but let's just_say their ability_to handle a disgruntled customer leaves something to_be_desired
just_don't go_here
i_was_very disappointed with_this_place
my_boyfriend_and_i went on_a_thursday night and_the_place_was almost empty
there were_only other_tables besides us
when_we_walked_in there_was_a sign saying to_wait to_be_seated
so we_waited
and_waited
finally after about_minutes
one_of_the staff looked up_from something behind_the bar_and noticed us
he instructed us_to
sit wherever
we chose a_table by_a window on_the north side of_the_restaurant
apparently a_bad choice
after another_minutes we_were given menus
another_minutes later we were_brought some water
we_placed our_order
we_had samosas for an_appetizer
they tasted ok_but were very_dry
they were_served_with
tamarind_chutney
rather than_a tamarind_sauce
the_chutney was_mostly garbanzo beans with_some fresh onion_and cilantro and a_tiny drizzle of tamarind_sauce
we_ordered lamb_biryani and chicken_korma plus rice_and_naan
the_naan was_very_good_and the_korma was_ok
the_biryani was_not_good
the_lamb_was very_dry and the_dish really just tasted like bell peppers
the_raita was_very watery_and didn't add any flavor
during_the meal we_were ignored by the_waitstaff
there_were people_working and_they checked_on the_tables on the_west_side of_the_restaurant times each while_we_were trying to_flag them down_for more water
both of_them hung out behind_the bar
one_was reading the_other seemed_to be_on_the internet
we finally_got more water after about_minutes
then we_were ignored again while the_waitstaff continued to_cater_to the other_tables
we_had_to flag them down again for_our bill
and_again to_get them to_take_the money
never again
we've been here_a_few_times now_and every_time has_been great
last_night we_had_the chicken_tikki_masala and chicken_makhani with rice_and_naan
we_finished that off and_ordered the_dessert sampler which_was a_great_way_to experience their desserts
service_was_great_and if i_could_eat only_one dish the_rest_of my_life
it_might just_be their makhani
having lived_in new delhi as_a child for_years
i_have always_been on_the lookout for_a_good indian_restaurant_in_the states
wherever i_have lived
i_even found a_good_one in fort wayne
indiana
for most_indian_restaurants
the trend is_to put_out large tubs of_curries and_tandoori_chicken made_with ready made pastes
with pre made pastes
it_is impossible to_get_a fantastic_indian meal
it must_be made_with fresh_ingredients
from scratch
even down_to making your_own cheese
it_got to_the_point that i_could_not scratch that itch for_the authentic tasting stuff so_i started making_it on my_own at_home
just_like mexican_food
the_best stuff is_made at_home
not_in_the restaurants
however
the tandoori_times bistro came along in_scottsdale and_i_had finally found my culinary nirvana
then as_if prayers were_being answered
tandoori_times came_to glendale
their_tandoori_chicken is exactly as i_remembered it_at modhi mahal's in_delhi
as_is_the dal
nan
mattar_paneer
i've read a_lot_of mixed reviews_of tt here on_yelp ranging_from
beyond bad
to exquisite
i_don't understand this
maybe because most americans don't know what_to_expect with_indian_food because_they either think_it's native american food_or they've never_had it in_their life before
most americans already know mexican_food
whether they like_it or_not
one_thing about food from_india
is_that_it_is an ancient cuisine going back thousands of_years
mexican_food as_we know_it
tacos
enchiladas
tostadas etc
is relatively new
why is_this important to_know
well
even the_rice_is different
basmati_rice has_been developed for thousands of_years to_get the_size_of grain and_taste
they care_about what grain of_rice they_use
it has_to_be basmati
uncle joe's brown_rice just isn't the_same
sorry
this_is_the feeling i_get from tt
they_know what authentic_indian_food is and_what it_takes to_make_it and_it_is no trivial
slap a_burger on_the grill_and fry it type_of food
it_takes days of preparation to_put out_the correct recipe and it_doesn't come from canned pastes
this_really shows up in_the_end result at_tandoori_times and_makes their somewhat high priced menu worth_it if you_know_what really goes into making good cuisine of_india
finally someone is putting in_the time_and effort_to making really good_indian_food
i_was_pleasantly_surprised
i'm indian_and so i'm_always skeptical of_places like_this
i_thought_it_was really_good
seriously
just don't_expect an_indian experience it's adapted for_a wider audience
tough call on_this_one
been_there a_few_times_and the_food_was_great but_the_service every_time is lacking
no attention no sense_of urgency they_just seem kinda bla
i_don't_know
if_you_go with lower expectations of_service you_will_be fine
i_have always enjoyed_the_food and_never been_disappointed with_that
decided to_try_this_place out with_a_couple_of friends_and we_were_all pleasantly_surprised
the waiter_was_very knowledgeable about the_menu_and let us_know if things_were spicy or if_they might be out_of something
since our_waiter told_us that all_of_the curries_are generally mild
i_asked to_have them make my lamb tikki_masala a_little_more spicy
like or on_a ten point scale
and it_came_out perfect
to_go along_with_the curry
we_got rice_and_garlic_naan
which is_like_a flatbread super good
be_warned though
the rice_and_naan a_plate is
each
refills on_the water were constant which_is good because_i drink a_lot
oh
and_they_have free chai_tea there which_was_delicious
if_i_had known earlier
i_would_have drank that the_whole time during my_meal
to_top the_good experience off
we_got_the assorted desserts which_was graciously given to_us for_free from our_waiter whom i'd_like_to mention was easy on_the eyes
overall
it_was_a really great_experience and_i_would come_back_again
the_food_was average
i've_had better naan_and fish masala somewhere_else
one_of_my friend got his order wrongly token
so_he waited sadly more minutes_for his correct order
the_belly_dancer was cool
i_was_a_little apprehensive about eating_indian_food in glendale i_lived_in los angeles for_years and_had access to_some pretty amazing indian_food
tandoori_times_is located in_a_strip_mall in glendale and_is honestly pretty unassuming
service_was_pretty good our_waitress_was on_top_of things and_kept our_water_glasses full and_offered her suggestions when prompted
for_dinner we_ordered_the
samosa choley
two crusty pastries stuffed_with green peas potatoes served_with garbanzo masala assorted chutney the pastry was_cooked_to_perfection and_the garbanzo bean masala was_super flavorful_and quite honestly the stand out_of_the appetizer
we_also_had_a an_order_of the_plain naan_and_the pesto naan the stand_out winner was_the classic plain_naan
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was great the_portion_was a_little_on_the small size
we_ordered a_lamb_dish as_well which was_pretty_good
my_favorite_was_the goat_curry which_is_the special offered on fridays
if_your in_the_area_and looking for_something other_than your_typical tgi fridays than_this is_a_great_place_to explore
i_always stuff myself at tt
the_food_is that wonderful
i_live close_by and_have_been eating_here once a_month for a_few_years now
it_never fails me
even their desserts are_well crafted
and the_free_chai is a_delight
a_solid
classic neighborhood curry_house that brings a_smile to_my tummy whenever_i visit
and_i visit often
you_should as_well
very_good_indian_food at a_fair price
i_have_eaten here_many_times
mostly with coworkers for_lunch
the_food_is usually above_average and the_free_chai is_very_good
the_naan_is also_good
i've been_going here_for indian_food_since tandoori village closed
i_have_not noticed any slow or bad_service like some_other reviewers have
their_food_is so amazing
you_can definitely do family_style
i_don't_know exactly what_we_had
i_know the_bread_was good
and_i_believe we_had shrimp and_coconut curry
those were_fantastic
love_the modern spin on the_indian_food
high_quality food and_always good_service
really_good naan_and dishes that_will satisfy everyone
lunch is_the_best value because dinner_is ala_carte style so dishes don't_come with_naan
rice
etc
this_is actually our_favorite_indian food spot in_phoenix
go_here
great_food
but_the_service is_extremely
extremely
yes
double word is deserved
slow
i_ordered_a drink
and_the_service_was so slow at_the drink actually showed up after the_check
the drink_was ordered with dinner
great_food_and a service
i_am definitely coming back again
we ordered_the_tandoori shrimp
naan garlic bread_and chicken kormi
so here's how our friday_night went down at_tandoori_times
arrive and walk_in the_door
sign says
please wait to_be_seated
so_we wait
and wait
and wait
a_few waitresses made eye contact with_us
but_no on really bothered coming over_to welcome us
there_were_a couple open tables_and i_could_have sat myself
but you_know
in_a new_place you_want_to play by_the rules as_much as possible so_we kept waiting
after about_minutes a young lady came_over_and asked if we'd like to_sit_in the open table less than feet away
yes please
i responded
after sitting at an_empty table_for about more minutes
we still_had yet to_be given our menus
silverware
or_even a_cup_of water
at_this_point i_wanted_to leave
because frankly i_wasn't having the_best time
fortunately our waters and menus arrived
after_being in_their doors for about_minutes
guess what happened next
if you guessed more waiting
you're right
we say at_our table_with empty bellies and waters in hand
for_about more minutes_before our_waitress returned
she asked_if_we were ready_to order i_wasn't sure_if she meant drinks or food
fortunately my_girlfriend was_quick enough_to position that_we_were ready with_our whole order
we_ordered_a couple soft_drinks and_all_of our_food
at_this_point i_think our_waitress recognized that_we_were a_bit annoyed by_our wait
and promptly returned with_our soft_drinks
props to_her for_some mediocre situational awareness skills
our food_came_out maybe minutes_after we_ordered_it
things are_looking up
or_so i_thought
about_minutes into eating
really loud hookah bar music started pumping through_the speaker
then she appeared
the_belly_dancer
now i've never seen a_real live authentic belly_dancer before
so_i_had pretty unestablished expectations
i_was_a clean slate
to_be as un rude as possible about her appearance it_wasn't the_most appetizing thing to_watch while_eating
frankly i_wanted_to tip her so that_she wasn't dancing in_the faces of my_date and_i but_i_think tipping would_be giving her false signals
such_as i_enjoyed her presence
i_feel_like tipping a dancer
strip club style and_having her stuff it_in her garments somehow
is_not what should be happening while_eating dinner
unless i'm having_the steak special at hiliter
after not finishing all_the_food
because_i_had lost my appetite
we_got_the check
paid and_left
now i_know_what tandoori_times_is like
i_really think they_could benefit from nixing the_belly_dancer from_the payroll and investing in_a hostess instead
i'm_giving it two_stars
as my_girlfriend was amused by_my attitude about_the_place throughout the_evening
and the_food_wasn't even bad
it_just came_with_a really bad_experience
well
at least she_had a_good_time
tandoori_times has a_number_of locations here in_the_valley and i've_had the_good fortune of_eating at_this one_and the_one located off_of i cactus
i've_eaten at this_location at least times as_it's one_of_my wife's favorite_restaurants
we_went_on_a thursday night_and walked_in with a_groupon which_they readily accepted
one_of_the positives is_that_they have_a_full bar_and a_very_nice wine_list which my_wife appreciates
i_like_the full_bar in_case i_want an_old fashioned as_i'm not_much of_a wine drinker
i_ordered_the lamb_vindaloo_and_the princess ordered the_chicken_vindaloo
the_dinner portions_are really family_style with enough_food for_a_couple of_people so needless_to say
we_went home_with leftovers
it sure didn't hurt my feelings to_have_to scarf that down for_lunch_the_next_day
the_basmati_rice is terrific
a_little saffron and_other spices_and it's perfect with the_vindaloo over the_top_of it
the_meal comes_with naan and_i_love naan
we buy it_at costco just to_have around the_house
the_naan here_is a_whole different level than_what_i pull out_of that bag
let me_tell you
soft
light
and_perfectly toasted
we upgraded to the_chili naan which_has green chilies sprinkled all_over it
it's awesome
definitely_worth the_next or whatever it_is
finished the_meal with dessert
surprise
surprise
went_with_the rice_pudding which_is of_a much lighter consistency that what i_would_say most americans are used_to
it_was_very_good
perfect way to_end the_meal_and cleanse my palate
which_is my argument for always having dessert
it_has the_same flavor components as typical rice_pudding
cinnamon
raisins
a_little nutmeg
just_not with_the custard like consistence
they_seem_to be gradually upgrading the_restaurant with new paint and decorations
it's_a very comfortable restaurant_with consistently good_service
i_think you'll like_it
if the_service were as_good_as_the food
they_would_have gotten four_stars
first
the_chef cannot make anything spicy
i_don't_know_if he doesn't know how or he_just doesn't care to
but_he just cannot make_a
chefs hot
dish_to match a real_indian chef
he sends out chili powder to_the_table if_you_want_a dish hotter
really lazy and_doesn't care is how it_seems_to me
we_have_tried three different times to_get_a spicy dish
a baby could_eat this_food
no heat at_all
the_servers_are extremely slow
they_have no sense_of urgency
they mostly stand with_their elbows on the_counter staring out at the_dining_room
also
check your check total
they almost always_get it wrong in_their favor by a_few bucks
if you come_in off peak
they_are_not happy_to_see you
they_will let_you know_that you_have_a limited time to_eat and_they_are closing the doors
that_is_a terrible business practice
for_the taste_of_the_food
you_think this_place would_be packed
the_groupon will pull you_in but_the_service will send you running
it_is_a real shame what the_servers do to_the reputation of_what could_be a_fine restaurant
but_it_is management's fault for_not keeping an eye on the_servers
the_food_was bland
the_service_was kind
but_very slow
the_naan tasted like wonder bread
i_have_been_to many_indian_restaurants
some_good
and many just_okay
in almost_all of_them
the_food_was better_than in_this_place
also
there_were more indian_people in_all_of those restaurants than in_this_place
that_should have_been an_early hint
i tried_this_place after_i bought a_groupon for_it
i_was_pleasantly_surprised
the lamb_tikka_masala was_awesome
the_best_i've_had in_a_while
the_service_was_good
it_was_very clean i_liked how you_can see the_chefs cooking in_the_kitchen
i_will_definitely_be returning
i_wouldn't visit_this_place
i_am_from south_india and_was disappointed_with_the chicken_biriyani served at_this_place
it_was_just chicken pieces added_to vegetable rice
the food_is_so_good
geez the_service ruins it for_me everytime
slow
slow
slow
shouldnt ever have_to_ask for_a refill on water when thats all your drinking
at_the_end_of my_meal
before asking_for the_check i_asked_for more_of the_yogurt stuff that comes_with the_biryani
took_forever_to get_the check_and when_he brought_it i_had asked again_for the_sauce
upon bringing it_back
he mentioned he didnt put_the side on the_bill
not_my fault
but_he said_it like_he was_doing me a_favor hahah this_is_not_the only time ive had slow_service
it_just seems_like they dont care at_all
i_am rating based on my_experience
i_had_been gifted a_groupon from_a_friend and upon entry i presented it_to_the waiter
we_were happily greeted_and seated quickly
the_service_was nice and_they_were very_attentive
the_food_was fine
it_wasn't spectacular
but_good
wouldn't mind coming again
but perhaps not when its busy
great_food
tastes fresh and_they_have something_for everyone
the_menu_has vegetarian
seafood
and meat_options
the_naan was_fantastic_and the_ambiance_is modern
open
and yet cozy as_well
would eat again
indian_food in_arizona
i_think tandoori_times_is a_solid indian_restaurant for_great saucy masala
soft_and tender fish
hot crispy naan
and_super flavorful chicken
but minus points for justin y
to receive an unpleasant bathroom experience after t
t
and the_food_took literally forever to_come_out
i_really did appreciate_the all_you_can drink self serve chai_tea
i_liked_it
jy didn't
pathetic service
i_am_an indian and_i_know how indian_food_is supposed_to taste_like
the_food_i got served was_a joke
the_server had_the balls to argue with_me and tell_me that_i had_no_idea how indian_food_is supposed_to taste
really moron i_was born and_brought up in_india
wish ok could give_a minus rating
want_to save money
never eat_here
we ordered_chicken_tikka
chicken_tikka_masala
chef hot
rice_and_naan bread
with_potatoes
and everything_tasted amazing
portions were_perfect for_the_price
our_server was_really_nice
very_satisfied with our_first_visit and_definitely plan_to return
good_food
good ambiance
great_location
i went_to_this_place a_long_time back when_they first opened
the_buffet spread then was_not_as extensive as some_of_the other_indian_restaurants
e
g
maharaja
however
what_they lacked in_food variety
they_made up_in taste_and ambiance
and with_its location on monroe street
it's_hard_to go_wrong with_this choice
my_wife_and_i ate_here as_it_was only_a_few blocks from_our bed breakfast
and easy_to_get a_table
the_food_was_good
but_not outstanding
the_service_was solid and_yes
the_ambiance was_okay
for_being in_a miniature strip_mall plaza
the_restaurant_has_a cozy feel to_it
we_had
two samosa
matar paneer_and aloo chana
along_with a roti
nothing stood out_as excellent
though the_peas cheese definitely had_a leg up_on the_potatoes chick_peas
the_samosa were_a_bit chewy
but not_bad
we_ordered our_food
medium
spice
and_it_was_pretty hot
i_feel_like it's_always a crap shoot in places_like this are they compensating for_me already
or are they talking hot is the_real deal
indian hot
we typically choose
medium
and hope in_this case
it_was borderline too_spicy
we enjoyed_the_food
but_it_was close if_we return
we'll probably go_with mild
the_portions_were plenty large enough
as_is_the case with most_indian_restaurants
overall
the_food_was fine
the_service_was_great
and_we_had_a nice time
when_we return_to madison for_our next_visit
though
we'll probably try_some different places
this is_clearly the_best_indian_restaurant_in town
having moved_to madison form chicago several years_ago
i bemoaned the_lack_of high_quality indian_restaurants
i_found_the local favorites to_be highly over rated
that_is
until taste_of_india opened
my and year old daughters have_come to_love indian_food_as a_result of regularly eating_here
the_lunch_buffet_is small
but_what is offered is_excellent
my preferred meal is dinner
my_favorite_dish is chili_chicken
nice_and_spicy
other excellent dishes include mango_chicken
malai_kofta_and aloo gobhi
incidentally
swagat
also relatively new
is also_excellent
but taste_of_india has_the edge with_its location on charming monroe street
difficult_to beat the_buffet
the_price_is good_and so_is the_food
filling
good_flavor
replenished frequently
and good_variety
the_sauce can_be_a_bit heavy and thick but_that_is necessary at_a buffet_to keep_the food_from drying out in_the heated hotel pans
really
nothing bad to_say
wish_i could visit more often
i_had_the lunch_buffet_here
it_was_very_good
and_reasonably_priced
for all_you_can_eat
the_bread_was outstanding
some_of_the hot_food was a_little_on_the heavy side
too buttery for_me
the_spices were_good
the_dishes_were strongly seasoned but with_some subtlety and complexity
none_of_the food_here_was even remotely spicy
in_a hot pepper sense
though
why five_stars
more hot spicy good
and less heavy on_the dishes
i_also was_less than impressed_by an eggplant_dish and_a_few other_dishes that_were a_little_on_the bland side
but_overall
the_food_here was_great
and the_bread_was really_good
desserts were also_very_good very_flavorful_and spiced just_right
amazing_food
great_service
great_prices
great buffet_for_lunch and_quick take_out
i_love_this_place
i_wanted put zero but yelp does not allow
worst place ever
the_owner_is rude an thinks that_he owns the_world
we_went_in once there
the_waiter made_us sit and wait only to_be told_that they_don't serve what_we_wanted
and_the to_top_it all the_owner says he didnt have time
seriously i_don't_know how the_food_was but in_no case can the_owner be rude
would_never advise anyone to_go_here
worst place
i_came one_day for_the_lunch_buffet as_it was_my_first_time eating_indian_food
lunch_is buffet_only
the_food_was_very_good and_fresh
i_highly enjoyed_the multiple dishes i_had
would def
go_back again
went_for_dinner last_night
it_had_been awhile since i'd ventured over_to taste_of_india
and_i_believe the_last couple_of_times i had_the_lunch_buffet
dinner_was thoroughly great
their chutneys are fresh
seem_to be housemade
and_flavorful
i_had_the_lamb madras chunks_of lamb_in a_rich sauce redolent of ginger
curry and_coconut
it was_really_tasty
the_lamb was_a_bit tougher than_i_expected
but_still_good
i_appreciated the server's suggestion that_i order_it a notch spicier_than usual
as otherwise the sweetness of tamarind overwhelms the_other flavors
we split the_spinach naan very plentiful basket for
my_boyfriend has_a standard order nearly every_time_we eat_indian_food
he loves the_tandoori mixed_grill
although taste_of_india serves theirs with raita
and_not masala curry_sauce as_other establishments in_madison do
he proclaimed theirs the_best he's had in_madison
a steaming mound of tandoori_chicken
fish
shrimp
and seekh kabob atop surprisingly flavorful red green bell peppers_and onions even with_a_little help from_me
we_took over half_of it home
at
that's a_steal
the_fish was something one doesn't see nearly enough_of on the_tandoori mixed_grill
and_it_was_a standout
well_worth_the trek from east_side to west
right down_to clean_and festive decor_and little touches like silver chutney spoons and antique tureens containing my_curry
mmmm
my_wife_and_i were long overdue for_a date_night
we_had_some coupons to_choose_from_and kathy decided_on taste_of_india
we_arrived just before the_dinner rush kicked in
we_went_with the non_vegetarian dinner_for
rice pullao and_fresh onion chutney
mint_chutney
tamarind_sauce
chicken_pakora
chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_curry
tandoori_chicken_and nan_and gulab_jamun dessert
the_food_came_out in courses
chicken_pakora app
the entre items
then dessert
too_much_for the_of_us to_finish so_we brought the_leftovers home to_enjoy
the service_was_attentive
but_not bothersome
and the_food_was_very_good
we will_be_going back
my_family_and i_come_here so_much for_the_lunch_buffet that they_know us
i_love_their lamb_masala and chicken_tika_masala
great nan_and samosas
i_don't_know_if it's_all that authentic
but_it sure is_tasty
our go_to_indian place_for dine_in or take_out
lots_of tasty_food attentive_staff
food_is_delicious
i've_never_had to_wait in_line or for service
the_wait_staff_is very_polite_and make great recommendations
it_is_great little_gem and_one_of madison's best kept secret restaurants there aren't many of_those
this_place_is cozy and_i enjoy_it over_and over again
taste_of_india is the_real deal
they_are careful to maintain their_buffet and replenish frequently
the_quality_of every_dish is treated as important
and_it shows
they_have a_lot_of_the standards
but_after several visits
we find_it one_of_the two best in_madison
best gulab jammon anywhere
service_is also well done
never a_wait
even the_buffet service_is carefully maintained
this_is_a simple place
but very_well done
my_go_to india place in_madison
flavors_are all there and_the_service_is spot_on
take_out is fast_and dinning in is a_pleasure
good nice staff as_well
went_here friday_night
it's_a fairly small_place
with seating for maybe about ish people
and_i'd say_they were_about half_full
so
no wait_for_a_table
and_we_had quick_and attentive_service
we_ordered_the samosas
goat_curry
spinach paneer
both at
medium
spiciness
regular_naan
and_garlic_naan
along with_a_couple_of kingfisher beers
the_spinach paneer was_really excellent
creamy
thick
and_with just_the_right_amount_of heat_and seasoning
the_samosas_were pretty standard
though especially good because_of how right out_of_the fryer crispy they_were
the_naan_was just fine
the_goat_curry was_the_only disappointment
with not nearly as_much meat as i_would_have_liked expected
especially at_around
next_time_i might stick_to veggie_options
my_favorite_indian_place
although_we eat_there often
my_husband_and_i always_get the_same_thing
we share the_vegetarian platter
mixed appetizers
mmmm
and i_get_the paneer_tikka
ahh
the yogurt_sauce
while he_has lamb pasanda
it's so_good we don't_want_to get anything else
recently
we ordered_take_out with_friends
and we_also_tried their chicken_makhani
it_was much pinker than_other chicken_makhani i've_had
and_made
and_tasted a_little different
it kind of looked_like chicken_vindaloo or tandoori_chicken
but anyway it_was_really_good
creamy and_flavorful but_not_too spicy
the_service at_the_restaurant is_always fantastic
they constantly refill your water_glasses and the_food_comes quickly
no surprise that even_though_it is off_the beaten path
it_is almost always crowded
someday i_hope to_try_their buffet_so we_can branch out a_little
great_food
pleasant service_and very_fresh weekend_buffet with_a wide_selection_of choices
the_carrot dessert is insane
and_they're very_nice to kids here
for_some odd reason we haven't stopped into_this restaurant_which coincidentally is down_the_street from_our home
that won't happen again
although i've made curry_and
indian
dishes in_the_past
this gives me something_to shoot for the_next_time my_wife_and_i cook
service
food
presentation
all_that
we_had_the vegetarian dinner_for_two that fit everything_we were_looking_for on_a cool spring evening in_madison
wi
although off the_main drag on monroe street
this_place_is worth your_time and money
the_service_is okay
not_great
the_selection_is not_that many though they_have coconut ice_cream in_addition_to their_mango one
the_taste is_not spectacular either
i_was_a_bit disappointed_that the_waiter didn't_come to_fill_up our glasses until i_asked them to_do_so
not_sure if_we want_to_be back
other_place offers_a much better choice
solid indian_food in_madison which_is tough to come_by
portions are_a_little small_for_the_price in regards to the_dinner_menu
yum
great_indian_food on monroe st
my pick up experience was_quick_and easy
i_called in my_order outside_and my_food was_ready in about ten_minutes
being somewhat of_a rice freak
i_asked_for an_extra portion after_i realized they_only provided a_small togo package of_rice
they_were nice_and gracious enough_to provide extra rice at no additional charge
my roasted eggplant_dish was delicious_with the_right_amount_of heat
the_naan_was very soft_and tasty
i_had enough for_dinner_and saved leftovers for_lunch_the_next_day
i suspect that i_might be picking_up dinner_here more_than once
while_i am in_madison
most definitely a_fan
this_is_my_favorite_indian restaurant_in_madison
i_love lunch_buffet
there_are a_lot_of delicious vegetarian choices
lentil_soup
samosas
vegetable_korma
saag_paneer
they provide great_service too
one_time they did_not_have saag_paneer and_my year old was very_disappointed
they responded by making_it special for_her
monroe street was_busy today_and all_of_the restaurants were packed for_lunch
bluphie's is_pretty mediocre
so we_decided_to_try taste_of_india
we had_the_lunch_buffet
which offered typical_indian dishes
it_had everything_i wanted and expected
and it_all tasted_good
the_service_was_very_good too
waters were refilled quickly_and my coffee cup was refilled multiple_times without even asking_for refills
staff members weren't too chatty
but_when paying our bill they_were_very kind
the_restaurant_was clean_and nicely_decorated
it's a_solid bet if_you_are_in_the mood for_indian_food
this_is_my family's favorite_indian_place in_madison
the_food_is_always delicious
and_the_staff remember us_and out usual orders and_we_are treated like family
you_can also order carry_out and_the_food_is just_as_good
the_decor_is a_little outdated
the carpet could use an update
maybe i_don't_like indian_food
but_i_just don't like_this_place
my_boyfriend has forced me a_few_times to_go_to_the lunch_buffet
the_service usually sucks
we_never get soda refills
one_of_the desserts tasted like pinesol
it_was_really weird and_we made_our friends try_it because_of how dead on it_was
the_second location of bombay_spice is_now open
it's conveniently located_on the_north west corner_of tatum and shea in the_whole foods soma cafe shopping_center
i_went with_a_group_of on tuesday night for_dinner_and out_of of_us loved_it
sorry again
marc i_felt awful that we_all enjoyed and_you did_not
let me explain
since i'd been_to_the th street location before
i suggested bombay_spice to mix things up a_bit
the_group i_was with are_pretty healthy health conscious so_i thought_they may enjoy indian_food done healthy
we_shared_the chickpea_ceviche as_an_appetizer and_then most_of us_ordered the_different rice bowls as entrees
we_had fun with the_variety_of sauces too
favorite choices included the_cauliflower
eggplant
chicken_tikka_masala
and_veggie tofu tikka as_well_as_the mint
hot
and_curry sauces
unfortunately
marc is allergic to onions_and everything he attempted to_order had onions in_it
by_the_time he placed an_order for plain chicken_and rice
we_were_all almost done and the_kitchen was slammed and_didn't prioritize his order
as_they should_have
so
marc didn't_eat
i will_return for_sure for_the_food it's prepared for the_health conscious eater and_it_is not_as heavy as traditional indian_food_i happen_to like_that
note
if_you_are allergic or really hate onions
be_careful about ordering so you_don't starve like my_friend marc did
stars_for_the food_with an_additional star_for originality
service and_decor
we were_a_bit hesitant to_try bombay_spice after_reading mr k's review on_their first location
it_seems that the_owners have_taken mr k's advice to heart and upped the_level_of spice
bombay_spice offers_a healthy interpretation of_indian_food by not deepfrying
not using butter
ghee
clarified butter
or cream
unfortunately this means that the_samosa loses all crunch with_the filling steaming up_the outer pastry
the_potato filling was nicely spiced but_that still didn't make up_for_the soft exterior
the_chickpea_ceviche a grander name for the_indian street snack bhel_puri on_the_other_hand would_have benefited from more spices
the pappadums that_are offered with_it is_a_nice crispy contrast to_the cool and tangy combination_of chickpeas
cucumbers
tamarind
mint_and coriander
not_sure why i_ordered_the seared scallops in landlocked phoenix
i_still remember spike on top chef this season madly drying his frozen scallops and_still did_not manage get_the crispy outer sear on_his scallops
similarly these had_a_nice dark sear but_the exterior was not_in_the least bit crispy
the_veggie skewer accompanying it_had nice smokiness from being chargrilled
the lamb_chops or_more appropriately lamb lollipops on_the_other_hand was overly spiced
we wish it_was served_with some starch or_even a_few slices of cucumber for contrast
a_great alternative_to the usually heavy indian_food
i_will_definitely give them another try in hopes that_they get_their spicing under control
i_love the_decor_and the_way the_chef came_out_to describe food reminded us of ourselves at_our ice_cream shop
hooray for independents with innovative original concepts
first
i_love that bombay is walking distance from_our house
great wine_list of bottles and_all at a_glass or a_bottle
i_can't_wait_to work my_way through the_list
martinis
cosmos also available
fresh lime juice for_the margaritas were outstanding
i_could drink them everyday with_a_great tequila
wink to mike
i'll keep my fingers crossed
we_had_the chickpea_ceviche
beef tikka
lamp chops
rice_pudding
yum
we_enjoyed all_of_the sauces
i_love_the chai_tea
i_used_to drive thru coffee bean now_i stop_by bombay_spice and get_one to_go_for half the_price
and_it taste better
the_quality_is outstanding and healthy
the_price_is right and_the_staff_is warm_and_friendly
thanks for_being our new neighbor bombay_spice
i've driven by their other location about_a million times_and i've_always said
we've got_to try_that place someday
well
last weeked
after arguing a_bit about where to_eat
a typical conversation at my_house
we pulled in_here on_the_way home_from the_shop
i_am_so glad that_it_is on_the_way home_from work
this_was_one_of_the_best meals we_had in_a_long_time
the_restaurant_is pretty new
and_you_can still tell at_a new_place
the_staff_is abundant
there appeared_to be two hostesses for_this small seater
and everything_is hyper clean
i_loved_the decor simple
yet bright_and cheerful
although_the homemade school project art was_a letdown
the_menu
once explained
was interesting
we_both_had combination plates so_we_could sample different flavors and_sauces and_we_had_a blast eating off_of each other's plates
the_beef tikka_was probably our_favorite
the_curry isn't too strong
but_the curry_sauce added a_bit_of punch and heat that seemed_to be missing from_the dish itself
this probably helps those diners who_are spice a phobic
but we_could_have taken a_little extra oomph
overall though
it_was_a_great meal_and very_affordable considering all_the_food we_enjoyed
the_wine menu_was great_too we'll definitely be_back
congrats to the_owners and_staff for hitting a home run
mmm
delicious_indian_food and a_great_selection_of vegetarian_dishes
i_love the_fact_that each_dish is mildly spiced
and_left up_to_the individual to customize the_flavor depending on which sauces they choose
i'm_a spicy lightweight so it_was_great that_i didn't_have_to worry_about getting something too_hot to_enjoy
i_had_a bowl_of brown_rice
cumin potatoes_and tofu masala_with a_cool yogurt cucumber mint sauce_on the_side
it_was_fantastic
i_can't_wait_to_go_back
also
i_thought_it_was adorable that_we_were given_a golden dollar coin with our_check for
making_the drive to_their location_and to compensate for high gas prices
a memorable gesture
i_have_to_say i used_to_be really scared of_indian_food
no_longer
my_first_time with_indian_food was_definitely a_pleasant one
i_thought the_food_was_very_good and_not_too spicy
and right_now they_are doing this golden dollar campaign where they_give_you_a dollar for coming to_the_restaurant because_they think that_is the_amount_of gas money you spent getting there
how nice_and conscientious of_you bombay_spice
i met a_friend here_for_lunch today because_i needed to_get out_of_the house
thank_you kylee if_you_are reading this
i_also_had a_craving_for_indian
now
i'm also trying_to watch what_i eat so bombay_spice seemed_to be_a_good option
let's get one_thing out_of_the way
if indian_food_was a bike
this_would_be_a tricycle
or_something with training wheels
meaning
this_isn't authentic_indian_food
that_said
it's very_good
and_very healthy
it's_a_little light on spice but_the_food still has good_flavor
they_have shakers of garam masala and_another spice mix that_has red chiles in_it but the_name escapes me
additionally
the_entrees come_with raita and a_choice_of another spice so_if you'd like more heat
order_the hot_sauce which_i did
it provided the_extra heat i_was_looking_for
i_got_the shrimp tikka_masala_and_the eggplant with_a_side_of brown_rice
a papadum
and_a whole_wheat chappti
huge freaking portions_of the_rice_and eggplant
the_shrimp was_disappointing
just three shrimp swimming in_a sea of_sauce
now
the_sauce was_good_but three
come_on
give_me a_little_more
my_dining companion had_the_chicken_tikka_masala and cumin potatoes
her portions_were equally as big
she also_ordered_the tamarind_sauce which_was_nice
almost a_bit like teriyaki sauce
all_of the_food_came_out within minutes of_us ordering
i_also enjoyed_the wine_list
glass are
flights are
and a_bottle is
our_server also said_that we_could order a_bottle and_if we_didn't finish_it they'd cork it and_let us take_it
one_thing_i particularly like about bombay_spice is_the ability_to order online
i_hate ordering on_the_phone because_it always seems_like a recipe for disaster
you never get what_you ordered
the ability_to order online is_also_a life saver when_you're like_me
frequently stuck on_a teleconference but desperately hungry
i_left happy_and full
and i_can't_wait_to return here_with my_family_and friends
i_highly_recommend bombay_spice for_people who have_never experienced indian_food_but are curious about_it
this_is_not an_indian_food place
this_is_a faux indian_food
bland food with_no gravy
just_be aware that this_is_not indian_food
i'm_not trying_to be rude or offend anyone but a_lot_of non indians are making comments about_this_place as if_they_are getting genuine indian_food
that_would_be the equivalent of someone eating_at taco bell and_then saying they_had great mexican_food
yes
the_food_is_not heavy because
it's_not indian_food
the_owner_is_a multi millionaire engineer who opened this_place with_the intent of appealing to_the mainstream
in_short
this_is_the pf changs of_indian_food
it's designed to appeal to non indians
the_food_is deliberately less seasoned to appeal to palates that can't withstand spicy_food
the_food_has also_has several contemporary american twists on_it to also appeal to_the mainstream
there_is nothing wrong_with that but bombay_spice should_not be approached as an_indian_restaurant but rather a swank a little_indian american fusion eatery
if_you_want to_try_something different that is_still tasty
check_it_out
if you_just moved_here and_are craving good ole fashioned indian_food
check out royal taj
guru palace
and dehli palace
i_think the_best_thing about_this_place_is the_bread
everything else_is average and if_you_want authentic cuisine
this_is_not it
but_its not heavy
the_service_was not_great
although i_think_the workers tried hard
they_just seemed understaffed
i_was_surprised on how_good the hummus was_at bombay_spice
having never seen hummus on_the_menu of_an indian_food_restaurant
i_was curious to_try_it_out
the hummus had_a_good consistency and_it_was yummy on the_naan_bread
bombay_spice offers many_dishes for_vegetarians
the_potatoes
lentils
and_rice are all_good
the_prices_are a_little_high for everyday dining
but the_happy_hour specials_are great
gr little_place
live so close_by
wanted_to try_for ages
glad_i finally did
happy hr is fabby
wines tappas
luved the_chickpea_ceviche y u m
chicken skewers go well_with above
twin humus plate_was a_nice_change
kids menu w drink w o w
will definately be_back
first
i_don't give four_stars easily
but_this_place deserves it
indian_food_is tough in_any city
most_of_it greasy
and undistinguished
this_place was_really_good
why
first
it_was_very fresh
not_greasy
but authentic
the_chicken
beef and_lamb tikkas
skewers
were terrific
all the_sauces_were excellent
the chapati bread_was whole_wheat
warm_and very_nice
paratha
stuffed bread w chix and_potatoes were also_excellent
hot chai_tea very good_as_well
not_too_sweet
there were_only two_of_us so_we_could only sample a_few_dishes
but_we will_return with_friends
all_the_dishes being_served to_other diners looked excellent
in very hip cities
ny vancouver there_is_a trend toward modern indian_cuisine
much like bombay_spice
give_it_a try
definitely
this food_is_amazing
they_have_a_great happy_hour
i_haven't_had a_bad_experience yet
do_not come_here if_you_want indian_cuisine
i_should_have read other_reviews more closely
do_i really_want hummus or ceviche at_an_indian_restaurant
this_place_is more_for wine_and tapas
the_decor_is_very hip and trendy but_i dine out for_the_food and_i_thought the_food_was bland_and tasteless
entrees_were high at each plate_and comes dishes served with_rice_and chapati bread
wheat tortilla
food_arrived not hot
my_friend_had vegetarian curry
veggies had_that frozen food rubbery texture
cumin potatoes were sour
my_chicken keema and_chicken_tikka_masala was_bland and niether dish had flavor
my basmati_rice was clumpy and sticky
i_did_not like_the ginger green tea
it_tasted_like licorice
i dunno
maybe i'm too harsh and narrow minded
i_did feel underwhelmed and disappointed
the_food_is_not amazing
i_came_in expecting allot but_it just_didn't live up_to what i_thought_the flavors would_be with_a name like bombay_spice
the_prices on_the wine are_great but the_menu_is a_bit confusing and the_food_has potential but_it needs allot of work
i'm a_big_fan_of indian culture and_food but_it's_not terrible but_there_is other_places that_have great_indian_food that_i_would rather_go
overall_i give_it about_a
save your_time and money this_place_is not worth_the_trip
have you ever_had one of_those experiences where_you saunter out_of_a restaurant after your first_visit there_and you_think
gee
not_bad
i'll be_back
and_then the_next_day you mention_the restaurant_to friends and_they shoot you down
not such_a_great place after_all
they convince you
well
in hindsight i see_that my_friend was_right about_the_food here being on_the bland side
yes
it_does seem_to be_prepared with_your arteries in_mind
but_what is indian_food without creamy richness and sweat inducing spice
i_give bombay_spice kudos for_the innovative plating and_for allowing you to_order two entrees for_the_price of_one
the_happy_hour is_a terrific idea
and_i might be_back just_for_the appetizers_and wine
tough call
indian_food_with the gloves on
might be_an appropriate description
first_and foremost i'm_going_to give_it to_them for_their cleanliness
indian_restaurants_are traditionally holes in_the_wall that serve food so_tasty that_you ignore some_of_the blatantly unhygenic details
bombay_spice is_very_clean which_is_nice for a_change
the_food
not_bad
think
bistro indian
sort of_the_place i'd take_my relatives that_would_be worried about eating something
international
everything_was flavorful_but somehow seemed watered_down
staff was_nice_and the_menu offered_a broad array_of great sounding dishes
i_would_probably go_back if people i_knew wanted_to_go but if_i_were by myself i'd_go try_and find an_indian_place that packs a_more flavorful punch
my advice is to_give_it_a shot and go_during happy_hour so_you_can try a_few_of their half price starters before making_the full commitment because the_prices aren't exactly cheap
stopped by_here yesterday at happy_hour
had_a late_lunch so a_friend i_shared_the carrot souflee
it_was_good but_not quite what we_were picturing
guess we should've asked
and_a_couple glass_of_wine
at happy_hour
regularly
all_the wines are glass or bottle
even on wines that cost quite_a_bit more at other_restaurants
the_service_was a_little_on_the slow side
but very_friendly
also really_like_the atmosphere
lime green white and black looks clean_and modern but warm
the_outside seating_area also looked really_nice
will_definitely try_it_again for_dinner soon
ate once
will never_go_back
the_food_has no_flavor
it_is fine to_make an attempt at healthy food
but you_cannot substitute real butter ghee with vinegar to kick flavor up
all_the curries had_a muddy consistency and vinegary after taste
how_can you screw up rice
it_tasted stale
the grains were broken up like_it_was from a_bag century old this_was not basmati
this_was_the worst of_both worlds
but_the public relations about
healthy
will fool the
naturally
endowed botox silicone crowd of scottsdale
good_food
good_service
good_prices
that's_all i_want out_of_a restaurant
there_are reviews_here that say bombay_spice isn't necessarily authentic_indian_food
maybe it's_not
so what
i honestly wouldn't know authentic_indian_food if_it bit me
it_still tasted_good
taco bell isn't authentic mexican_food either but sometimes it_still tastes good
all i_can_say is_that_i liked_the_food at bombay_spice and_there_was a_decent vegetarian section
i'll definitely go_back
if_you_like_indian flavors_and aren't a snob about perfect indian_cooking
give_this_place_a shot
edit a_few_months later i'm moving them up_to stars
i've_been_to bombay_spice a_few_more times for_lunch_and the_food_is_great every_time
menu overhaul did_the trick for_this_place much better_than when_they first opened
new veg curry
naan
and_more are_good additions
and when_you request it_spicy hot they_actually cook_it that_way
rather than sending it_to you mild with_a_side_of red pepper flakes like they_did last year
nice contemporary feel
menu is_still awkward for_indian_cuisine
people unfamiliar with_indian_food probably won't care
but devout consumers of_indian_food like_me are annoyed when they_make the_menu so non traditional
want your chana in_a bowl
plate
or wrap
modest wine selection is_a_nice improvement over what you'll find_at traditional indian_restaurants
portions_are somewhat small
as_a health nut bombay_spice doesn't really satisfy all_of my requirements
i_would_like_to see organic produce meats_and wild fish shrimp utilized in_the cuisine
but alas this_is still a_tasty healthy ish place_to_eat
the shrimp_curry lettuce wraps are really_tasty as_is_the naan
which again i_wish was organic
they_do use olive oil
as opposed_to trans fat or_something rancid like canola oil
so that_is an_awesome start
i_would_say stars_for taste_and for_being one_of_the healthiest indian_places_i have_come across
of_course if health is not_at_all a concern of yours the_food_here tastes phenomenal
i_went_for_the lunch_special i_wanted_to_try it_out
first of_all_the lunch plate_was
i_had_the beef tikka_masala_and veggie curry
the_dishes_were okay
i_am glad_i asked them to_make_it hotter because_the hot seemed_to be more_of_a medium so_i_can't imagine how mild the_masala is normally
as_for_the flavors
they were_okay
the_menu states that_it_is fresh
healthy
incredible indian cusine
i_guess one out_of is not_bad
maybe
i_need_to give_it another shot
two words
chickpea_ceviche
it's tasty and_sweet
i_love_indian_food
i'm constantly driving through this intersection and have_always wanted to_try_it
i finally_got the_chance and on_top_of_that it_was lunchtime and_their sign said
lunch_specials
i_arrived around am and the_place_is empty
i_ordered_the
dinner
portion as_i_was sharing with_my child
for chicken_curry chicken_tikka_masala
i_also_ordered a_side_of plain_naan
the_entree came_with_a
row
of rice_that separated the_two choices i_made
the_rice tasted like something_that came from uncle bens no_flavor and every_time_i scooped up rice there_was a_lot_of water soaked rice underneath
the_chicken_curry_and chicken_masala tasted the_same
one_was red the_other wasn't
again
very_little flavor
how_can indian_food lack so much_flavor
the_naan was_just_a flat_bread
nothing important about_it
but_it vaguely reminded me_of_the frozen naan they sell at trader joe's
and_when_i started thinking_about_it
so did the_curry masala
i_ended_up spending over dollars for my_meal that i_shared with_my young child
i_felt_like i_could_have gotten the_same_thing at trader joe's sans the watery rice for_about
i_gave this_place two_stars
just based_on_the great_service the_waitress gave and_another for_it trying to_be_a healthy indian_restaurant
trust
go_to_the indian_buffet_in the airpark
although it's the_real deal
it's_worth_the money_and calories
bland
and
watery
are_not words you_want_to spring to mind when_you_are eating_indian_food
unfortunately
these_are the_two words that best described my_meal from bombay_spice
being vegetarian
i_was_excited_to see the_number_of different vegetarian_options on_the_menu
and_i_was pleased to_see_that you_got two choices_for the_lunch_special priced_at
this came with_rice
brown or white
and either roti or lettuce
confused as_to why they_offered this i_would rather a_small side salad rather than_a plain chunk of iceberg lettuce
i_also_ordered garlic_naan for an_extra
i_ordered_the spinach_and tofu
normally this_dish is served_with paneer an_indian cheese that_has a texture like tofu but has_a richer flavor
and_the vege curry
eggplant was_not on the_lunch_special menu otherwise i_would_have tried that
the_food_came quickly
but unfortunately
it_was_really just watery_and bland
they_also kind of scrimped on_the rice portion
the_naan_was
ok
but i've_had waaaay better elsewhere
the_food had none_of_the spices or flavors you_would_expect from indian_food
i understand toning down the_heat to_cater_to american palates
but_this just_didn't taste_of anything
i_had_a more flavorful curry_at my chinese restaurant the_other_night
and_i've had_better curry frozen from trader joes
i_was also not asked_if_i wanted the_food mild
medium
or hot never a_good_sign at_an_indian
or thai
restaurant
to_me it implies they_are too lazy to_cook the_food_to order
actually if_it_was sitting_in a vat for several hours
that_should improve the_flavor but clearly they_are_not using the_right spices because_i couldn't taste any
despite the_name_of the_restaurant
i_will_not_be returning_to bombay_spice
don't waste_your money here
well
at least the_owner_is consistent
as with roka akor
this_place_had great style in the_decor
but_the_food just was not_very_good
we_ordered chicken_tikka_masala_and a_curry
both_of the_sauces_were flavorful_and balanced
but none_of_the flavors penetrated the_meats in_the curries
it_almost tasted like the_curry_was cooked_in one pot
the_meat_was boiled in water_and the_meat_was dropped into_the curry_at the_last minute
maybe its the_old school in me
but_its such_a waste to_order_a meat dish_and leave the_meat behind
the search continues for good_indian_food_in my hood
what_a_great alternative_to indian_food_with all those really heavy cream based sauces
btw
i_love them
but_they can_get kind of fatty
bombay_spice reminds you that_you_can do indian
go light
and_still have_a_really good_meal
i_always_get_the lamb_chops as_an_appetizer
they_are freaking delicious
entrees you_can mix and match different_types
what style
bowl
roti tacos
plate
etc
i ususaly get chicken keema and_lentils
all the_entrees have good_flavor
some spice
i_like to_ask_for more
and are_nice and_filling
but not_in_a heavy way
service has_been mixed from super_nice waitresses who would fit in at_any star place_to surly and unattentive ones who need_to_be flagged down_for even_the basics
like drinks
ordering
asking_for check
refills
update
i_went_there the_other_night with my_wife_and two kids
and mo
there_were at least tables open and the_manager
owner
came_over_and told_us that there_were_no tables available
none_of them could_be combined into_a table_for four
it_was pm
i call bs
there weren't any kids there and_she gave_us_a good look up_and down then shook her head no
we've been_there at least a_dozen times with the_kids
we_order lots_of food
tip well and_our kids don't disturb anyone
we_eat out every night of the_week
they are_both model citizens
i_know_the look that i_got
we_weren't welcome there
don't worry
we wont be_coming back
ever
there's no shortage of good_food in_this town
we can_find plenty of places_that aren't afraid to_see_a young family walk_in
good lamb_chops aren't worth being disrespected
we love_this_place
we_found it by chance when_we came last year to_look for_a house
indian_food can_be very buttery and fat laden
aka delicious
bombay_spice adds a
healthier
flair to indian_food_that we_love
you_can get things with lettuce wraps instead_of rice
my_wife likes that_their dishes_are less greasy than_other restaurants
not_to harp on_them too_much
but some can_get that_way just_because the method you_have_to make the_meat or sauce
check_it_out sometime
the_worst you_can say_is you didn't_like it
but if_you_like_indian
i_think you'll love bombay_spice
the_food_is fantastic
it's_a healthy alternative_to most indian_food
my_husband_and_i have_always enjoyed_the_food
the_service
however
consistently awful
my_husband_and_i don't complain a_lot and we_know the_service industry is tough
plan_to be_there for_an hour_and a_half to hours if go_for_dinner
drinks never refilled
waited minutes_after we already finished our appetizers for the_server to_take_our_order for_dinner
we essentially bussed our own tables
plan_to not see your server during and_after you_eat
plan_to wait to_get_your check
we likely will_not_go back because_of_the terrible_service
ate here_on_a trip
it_was_pretty much the_only_indian place around
so we_gave it_a_shot
decor ambiance c
it's clean
but pretty_small and boring
sterile
for lack_of a_better term
service c
pretty average server_and timeliness
food c
in total we_ordered_the chickpea_ceviche
sauce taster
garlic_naan
samosas
and most_of_the vegetarian_entrees
everything_was ok
nothing bad
but_also nothing great
i've_had indian_food_that was_light
but_still tasty
this_was light
but bland
so
it's not_bad at_all
but_it's also_pretty ho hum
surprisingly_good
as i_am_not a_fan_of_indian_food
the_service_was_good
and_attentive
i_asked_for and received a sample tasting of_the featured masala_sauce
we_both enjoyed our_meals
but they_do need_to get rid of_the
guys
thing
this_place touts healthy indian_food_i've never_heard_of such_a thing
was_pleasantly_surprised with my_dinner
ordered the_plate with lamb_curry and_chicken_tikka_masala
the_lamb pieces were_nice and tender_and the_flavor_was great
the_chicken_tikka_masala was_not_as rich as i'm_used_to but_it too had good_flavor
both_were quite_spicy and made_me appreciate_the dollop of raita which_was served with_the_meal
i_liked that they_gave you the choice_of brown_rice or basmati
the healthy spin was_definitely an upside but it_took away_from_the full potential of_flavor
service_was_ok
they_weren't that busy while_i_was there_but the_servers chatted amongst themselves until they_were waived down
food_was_good but_if you're looking_for_a traditional_indian meal this_isn't the_place_for you
this_is_definitely not traditional
true indian_food
we_ordered naan_and received
pita_bread warmed up_and sliced in quarters
the nerve
to label something on_the_menu as naan and_then serve pita_bread that looked_like it_just came out_of_a bag from whole foods
and today they_were_out_of chicken_tikka
gasp
sigh
the_chicken_masala was_bland
but the_chicken_curry was_tasty but_not noteworthy
the_chickpea_ceviche was_good
the_service_was attentive_and responsive
i_would_suggest to_try_it at lunchtime to_save and_try a_few_things to_see_if you_might like_it
food_was_great
the_service could have_been_better but wasn't horrible
quiet location
i_was_told a_while back_to_try bombay_spice
my_husband_and_i are changing our lifestyle by eating healthy
this_is_a_great option_for anyone looking_for_a healthy alternative
i_liked_the option to_have brown_rice or lettuce wraps
they_also have tofu
which_is difficult_to find_at most_places
we_tried_the sauce sampler
seared salmon
chicken_tikka_masala
veggie curry
and_chicken_curry
everything was_very_good
was_a_great change_from_the usual chain restaurants
absolutely_delicious indian_fare
can even_get completely vegan
it's small inside
but_they turn tables quick so_you shouldn't have_to_wait long
for_our own food
we_waited only_a_few minutes_before we_had piping_hot
tasty curry on_our_table
we_had_the chickpea_ceviche
recommended_by our_server
for an_app and_it_was so_fresh_and cool and crisp tasting
then onto_the bombay plate
picks of entrees with lettuce wraps and_each thing we_had_was sooooo good
spinach_and tofu
vegetable_curry
eggplant curry
vegetable makki
and_lentils
came_with_a little roti bread_and we tore into_it
for desert
we_could only_the sorbet since the_other options had allergy inducing pistachios
but it_was_a_nice cool
rich tasting treat
our_server_was severely genuine and sincere
and made_us_feel like valued customers
of_course
she_was from alabama so_we would've expected nothing less
a_pleasure to_have her taking care_of us
a_great_place and_i_know we'll be_back_here
bucks for_two with large apps
a_large entree
and desert
so being_the foodie that_i_am i_am always down to_try_new places
this_place_had a_table at the_last yelp event i_went_to with_my fiance and_we really_enjoyed_it so we_thought we_would go_in and_give it_a_try
i thoroughly_enjoyed everything that we_tried and it_all lived up_to what_i know_about indian_cuisine
spicy_and good
the_only_thing_i disliked about_this_place is_that_the service_was_a_bit_slow
they_only_had one waitress working the_whole place in_the_middle_of lunch rush
which i_thought_was a_bit ridiculous considering that_there_were tables with_people at them
seemed_like_a bit much for_one girl even though this_place_is_a bit small_and you had_to_wait quite a_while for_your refills
besides that the_waitress was_very_friendly_and informative
i_would_not go_out_of my way_to_go eat_here again but_definitely enjoyed_the_food and_atmosphere
more_like half stars
so after_my negative review
i_was offered a_chance by_the restaurant_to come_and re try_their food
i responded via email to the_manager
never_heard back
way to_add salt to_the wound
tried bombay_spice last_night
after_reading_the website and reviews
it_seemed_like it_would fit perfectly our combined need_to finally find good indian_fare in_phoenix and_not blow our calorie budget
husband_and_i are trying and succeeding
in losing weight
success on both counts
it_was saturday at_about
and we_were_seated_immediately
the_place_was almost full
we_sat on the_patio
which_was lovely
but might get too_hot during_the summer
i didn't_see any misters you're welcome
mother earth
service_was_attentive
and our_waitress gave us several recommendations
we_ordered
somosas
baked
i_think
not fried
which_made them a_little messier to_eat but_still very very_tasty
naan
chewy
moist
naan y
yum
grilled shrimp skewers
a_little_on_the skimpy side
but very_tasty
and served_with grilled peppers_and onions_and a delightful mint sauce
we each ordered individual entrees with_basmati
they encourage you to_order_the two entree choice
but_we_were trying_to avoid over ordering
and_it turned_out_to be exactly the_right_amount_of food
i_ordered_the cauliflower and_potatoes
which_was moist
savory
a_little_spicy
and_very_tasty
albeit lacking a_little in_the_sauce department
i_would_have_liked a_little something_to spoon over my rice
husband ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
which_was exceptional
they claim that they_don't use cream in their_food
so i_don't_know how_they made_the masala_sauce so creamy_and good
but they_did and_i'm not_going_to question it any more
i_would_have licked the bowl if we_had_been at_home
next_time_i think we'll get_some apps again_but try_the bombay plate to_share
which_is entree choices and_rice
that_way we can_try a_whole bunch_of things
before tip for naan
two appetizers
and_two single choice entrees
not bad_for a_saturday out
we'll definitely be_back
even_though_it was_kind_of a drive for_us
definitely_not authentic_indian_food
felt like fast_food indian_food_at best
service_and atmosphere were just_ok
i_don't consider bombay_spice an_authentic_indian restaurant
more_of_a modern_and healthier version_of the indian_cuisine
i_appreciate their healthy take and_their vast vegan_and gluten_free options
i_have_been_to bombay about five or six times over_the course_of the_last year
and have_eaten some_of their items at yelp events
i_have_never disliked any_of_the items i_have_tried
but_there have certainly been a_few items i_found less than flavorful
vegetable lentil_soup
cauliflower
spicy veggie curry
last_week i_tried_the seared tofu
and_it_was absolutely_amazing
it_is_an appetizer
but comes_with five or six good sized slices of tofu
and_i_would eat it_as_a meal
i_also fell in_love_with the_delicious tofu masala
i_couldn't be happier with either of_those selections and highly_recommend them
i_also_like that_you_get to_choose two menu_items and have_it served_in a_variety_of ways
plated with_rice
lettuce wraps
roti taco
etc
it gives a_little extra variety depending on_your mood
one complaint_i have_is that_they_do not_know which wines are vegan
to_have_a separate menu focusing on vegan entrees_and to not_know what complimentary drinks are_also vegan leaves me a_little dissatisfied
overall
bombay has good_service
a_good location next_to whole foods
progressive menu_items
is moderately priced
and_has a_good_variety_of items available_for vegans and carnivores alike
yes
the_previous reviewers are right
not an_authentic_indian
however it_is_a very_good place
we_really_enjoyed the paratha naan_and_the lentil tower
i_had_the salmon and_it_was nicely seasoned
chris was_very_nice to_let us try the_other sauces
i_am_a sauce person so i_loved_the tamarid sauce_that comes_with the paratha naan_and_the somosas
we would_be here every_other day if it_wasn't because_it_is a_little_bit too far for_us
went_here_with a_party_of last_night
tuesday
at_about pm
the_place_was mostly empty with just_a_few diners eating
the_decor_is modern
neat and_clean if that_makes sense to anybody
it_wasn't over the_top and_you probably couldn't tell this_was an_indian_food place by looking_at_the decor at_all
i_am beginning to_like indian_cuisine_and its_good that there_is_a place_like bombay_spice that makes_it healthier
this_is good because_i had_no_idea that
regular
indian_food_was unhealthy
oops
i've been meaning to_try_this_place for_a_while and_by chance i_found_it on local dines so_i snatched up_a cert for
http
bit
ly dfr eq
definitely a_solid find for a_solid place_and worth_it because their_food isn't very expensive to begin with
anyway
the_service_was_excellent and the_food_came_out quickly
here is_what_i sampled
caesar salad this_was weird and_i'm glad i_tried_it but_i wouldn't get_it again
it_was_just romain lettuce tossed with_some weird caesar like dressing
our_waitress said_it_was a_weird salad but_i wanted_it anyway
sauce sampler w naan_bread this was_just_ok
it_was_worth_it though to_try_their sauces
nothing_to special about_it
lentil_soup i_didn't_like this
it_was_really thick_and weird
tikka skewers peppers
onions_and chicken stir fried
this was_pretty_good
beef tikka_masala
chicken_curry
spinach_and tofu
and_chicken keema all_of this was_very_good
i_got of_the above and sampled the_rest off of_the_other plates_of my_party
my_only real issue is_that_the food lacked a certain kick or pizazzz
i_guess that's_what all_the unhealthy stuff that other_places use adds to_the dish
i_don't_know
it_just wasn't_as flavorful as i_would_have_liked
i would_order the_stuff again though
perhaps next_time_i_will kick it_up a noch with_some of_that stuff on_the_table that looks like cinnamon but later learned it_was some hot spice stuff
i_will_be_back soon to_try_more of_their stuff
i_can't_believe the_average rating isn't higher for_this_place
my_only real complaint about_it is_that it's so_far away
especially now_that they closed their other location
i_got hooked on contemporary indian_food not too_long ago
and bombay_spice does it well
shame on_me for thinking the_other_reviewers were_just picky_about their indian_food
everything you'll read here_is consistent with_what has_been said before
the_food_is
healthy
indian_style
it's okay
but_definitely lacks the authentic flavor that traditionally bursts off your_plate when you_eat indian_cuisine
the_naan_was more_like pita_bread and_the_curry seriously tasted like stew
the tikki_masala sauce although_not as_good_as_the traditional was good_enough to_eat as_an alternative
if you're_going_to go_to bombay_spice
go for_lunch
it's_just_not that exiting of_a venue to_waste on dinner
even_though_the food_was_just okay
the_service_was_great
so_i_can't possibly rate them at less_than_a star
after_all they_did deliver
healthy
indian_food_as promised
it's okay
like the_vegan aspect
using tofu in place of_paneer is not_a_good substitute
i'd rather_go without than have_the tofu in_there
it's_just_not the_right texture
spice_level was_ok
could_have had more_flavor
heat_level was_fine
the
veggie based
rather than cream sauces they tout are a_great idea
but sit walk by the_kitchen_and look around
you'll see big jars of_veggie stock base
you_know_what that stuff is
salt
more salt
msg
yeast extract
and_some veg flavor
c'mon
if you're trying_to do healthy then why base all your sauces on fake flavored salt paste and pass it_off as_a healither option
honestly
i'd rather have the_full fat
cream laden version that tastes so_much_better
at least it_was natural
reviews of_this_place were pretty_decent on_yelp
but_i_thought this_place_was pretty_good
granted
i gather it's_not as authentic as_some other_indian_restaurants
this_place still holds it's own
maybe it's the_spice_level
well needless_to say your_food should only be so_spicy
my masala ck's spice was_perfect for_me
i_can handle a_few peppers
but i_must_say too_much is ridiculous milk please
the_ambience_is neat
the_fresh green wall on_the bar really brightens the joint and the_wine lined up_to_the top_of_the ceiling is_a_great design call
our service_was okay and that's_all i'll say enjoy
i_went_with my young son last_night to_check_out_the new_menu
and i_loved_it
i_ordered_the chickpea_curry over brown_rice
spicy
it was_absolutely_delicious
and_is alone a_good reason to_return
we also_ordered_the lentil patty appetizer
which_was_good
although not_my_favorite
they_serve a
masala
black iced_tea which_was unusual and_delicious
my_son ordered_from the_kids meal
a backup
just in_case
and_he chose baked chicken fingers which_came_with a_side_of fruit cocktail and a_full sized drink
overall
the_food_was_a modern
healthy version of_my_favorites
with courteous_and attentive customer_service in_a beautifully decorated space
four_stars because i_want_to try_more of their_menu
make sure service and_quality stay consistent
and because_they_were inexplicably playing a steve miller band greatest hits album during our_visit
i_want_to fly like_an eagle
to_the sea
i_am definitely a_fan_of bombay_spice
their food_is_delicious
healthy priced right
my_boyfriend i_went_there the_other_night got an_appetizer two entrees the_bill was_only twenty bucks
granted we_did_not get_any drinks
but_if_you_are going_here with_the intention of_being healthy
you_should stick_with water anyway
we started_with hummus
not_my absolute favorite hummus but_still a very_yummy starter
i_ordered_a cauliflower curry wrap
i'm obsessed with the_naan_bread
the_curry made_it taste like_i_was eating much_more than_just vegetables rice
getting your dish
hot
isn't really that spicy
for_us anyway
we love_spicy
but ask_for their spiciest dipping sauce if_you_like more bite
i_want_to buy bottles of_it
i saved half_of the wrap for_lunch_the_next_day it_was_still delicious
boyfriend got the_chicken_curry entree
basic
but_he loved_it
again
it_was gone before_i could try any of_it
i worry_about places_like these hidden away_in strip malls
it_is_a really nice_place
but always seems_to be pretty empty when_i_go in
the_decor_is neat modern
not_a kitschy indian_place by_any_means
they_have_a pretty_nice wine_list
so it_would_be a_nice place_for_a quiet date
hopefully the_word starts to_get out_that this_is_a delicious
healthy place that_is affordable tasty enough to_eat_at all_the_time
this_restaurant would_be_a very_nice introductory experience for_those who have_not previously enjoyed indian_food
for_those who_have are_more experienced with_indian
pakistani or afghan cuisine this_restaurant will_not be_a par experience_with your favorite family ran establishment
we_used to_love coming_here
but last_night was the_last_time we_will ever_go
we_are not_a_fan_of the_new concept noodles with_indian_food really
the_chicken_was rubbery and_the_naan_was just slightly better_than cardboard
from_what_i can tell
while_waiting almost minutes_for_our food
is_that_they have_one good waitress
but unfortunately she_was not our_server
we_had enjoyed a_meal here_about a_year_ago
we_went_here again to_enjoy a_vegan meal
it_was_a total disappointment
after_ordering a meatless meal
the_waitress brought_us a_free appetizer with bits_of chicken on_it
i thanked her but refused because we_did_not eat meat
she made big noise of disgust and returned it_to_the kitchen
i_ordered naan_and got_some roti wrap
the_waitress insisted it_was naan it_was_not
the_kitchen staff_were cutting up_and having a_good_time in spanish and the_waitress_was having a_great_time with_them not conducive to_dinner
the supposedly spicy_sauce was_incredibly bland_and i_could_have had_a wrap at chipotle that_was better
two_days after_we ate_there
my spouse's credit_card was used in egypt and some_other country so_he had_to cancel his card
so_if_you go_there use cash
mouth wateringly goooood food
nothing on_the_menu_is over calories and the_owner_is_a doctor nutritonist who spent a_lot_of effort on craft the_menu
it_really shows in the_quality_of what's to_offer
everything looked good_and smelled awesome
but in_the_end one always has to_make_a choice
so
my_wife_and_i ended_up_going for the_chickpea_ceviche starter
then lamb kebobs and chicken_curry_with extra pappadoms instead_of naan_to keep_it gluten_free
all dishes_were a smash hit and washed down_with a_perfect mango_lassi drink
delish
wait_a sec the picture that jessica f uploaded of_the_dishes and_a drink_was my_lunch
i'm_so looking_forward_to coming_back_here for_another taste_buds extravaganza
the_only_thing i'd change is_that_the page menu to download from their_website is_a whopping mb file it's time_to fix that people
maybe it's_just me
but_i_don't understand why this_place_is still in business
okay
admittedly i'm not_a_big_fan_of indian_cuisine
but i've_been_here twice now
once to_try_it for_myself and_another time because a girlfriend dragged me_here
i just_don't get_it
with so_many restaurants going out_of business
how is this_one still making_a go
i_will_say the_servers_are very_friendly_and_attentive
but
for_me
that_doesn't make_up for the_lack_of ambiance and_the_food
the_place_is located in_a_strip_mall and_the inside_is just_okay
most_of_the tables are placed close together
so_you could_easily hear one another's conversation
however
since we_were_the_only people in_the_restaurant
this turned_out_to not_be a_problem
the_food_is okay
i_guess
i'm not_a_big_fan_of lamb or curry
so_i_can't be_a_good judge
i_ordered_the vegetarian flat_bread and_it_was okay
i_also_had an ice tea
but it_had_a weird and slightly unpleasant flavor
if they_don't start drawing in more customers
i'm thinking
they might_not be around that_much longer
love_the_food here
and so_many vegetarian_options
one_thing i_dont like is the_masala iced_tea
tastes_like the_spices in_the tea should be_on food
omg what_a nice_place
but_the_food no comment
please save your money for_another authentic place
everything_was made sweet to accomodate the unknown taster's palate
dosa_was as soft as_a crepe
korma had fruit like mango raisins_and half grapes in_it sweet
tandoori wings in_a sweet_and sower sauce
nothing_was the_way we expected an_authentic_indian pakistani restaurant to_be booohooo
if_you_like indian_cuisine
this is_the_place_to_go
lamb_chops appetizer amazing
entree equally delish
great_service too
bombay has done an absolutely fabulous job in menu revisions lately
being a_vegetarian
it_is_a fabulous place
there_is_a tofu or potato option available_for all entree choices
there food_is also extremely low calorie and healthy
it's_so darn_good
though that_this seems_to be untrue
but_it's_not
i_never feel overly full or stuffed
they_have awesome wine specials
bucks a_bottle for a_large variety_of
tastes some high end
and_some couple's nights deals comparable to most restaurants
buckish
happy_hour specials look awesome
though end before i'm off work and head out
i minus one small star_for service
seems mildly slackish at_times and_not customer centered
it's_a_small establishment
so_i unfortunately cannot blame a_busy server bartender
at_times the_service does seem aloof
however
if_you_love modern music
fabulous indian_food
and a_wide_variety_of wine
come hither
it's a_great_place i_feel is trying_to improve and_i applaud the_option of_vegetarian_dishes and_all low calorie
body happy foods
kudos bombay
we_used our discount coupon that_we bought at homerun
com to_try bombay_spice grill
it_was_wonderful
food_was_delicious
reasonably_priced_and healthy
the_service_was_great
very_friendly
it_was_a great_experience_and we_will_definitely go_back there
stopped_in_for lunch
not fancy
if_you_want_a great chicken_curry
come_here
service_was_great
i'd_come for_dinner any_time
good wine selection
i_went_here last_week and_i_am definitely a_fan
i_love_indian_food
so hearing this_is_a healthier version_of indian_cuisine i_had_to_try it
i_got_the lentil cakes as_an_appetizer which were_really_good
the_main_course i_got was veggie tikka_masala
the_sauce isn't what_you would_get at_a traditional indian_restaurant
but_it_is flavorful_and delicious
i_would_have_to say you_can't compare this_restaurant_to an_indian_restaurant
because_they_are very_different
i_would_say this_is modern_indian food
kind of_like pf changs is_to chinese_food
i_gave them stars
because the_service_is alright
they_weren't attentive_and we_did wait awhile to_put in_our order_and to_get_our food
the_good news is that_they_have bottles of_wine
so_it gave us time to_finish the bottle without chugging
awesome_food service reasonably_priced
while i_am_not_a huge indian fan
i_am now this_place exceed all expectations
our starter was the_eggplant it_was_perfect texture_and the brown soy sweet sauce was_out_of_this_world seriously i'm actually craving_it right_now
next up chick_pea ceavecha with crispy wavers was_also dead on reminded me of_a pumped up salsa and_the chick_peas again perfectly_cooked amazing flavor
so at_this_point i'm sold and_then bam tandoori_chicken wings holly smoke amazing sweet smoky sauce_and best part no grease really quality pieces_of wings and drumsticks
we_also_had_the little rack of_lamb app again cooked_perfectly
wonderful lamb flavor not_too strong just perfect_and presentation_was beautiful green rosemary lightly sprinkled on top
flatbreads veggie_and chicken again
flavors_were out_of_this_world cheese was mild
veggies tasted perfect
our large group's favorite_was_the curry i_thought my colleague was_going_to lick the bowl it came_in it_was_a_bit embarrassing
oh_and our youngest member of the_group got chicken fingers which_were made in house and_came with_no grease and lightly breaded
it made_me realize the importance this_place puts on the_quality_of_the_food
shout out_to a_great server jewels who really is_a precious jewel in_his own right_and as_the girls at_the_table said with_some serious good looks too
they loved his smile and_his dark hair and eyes
he was_very_attentive
earnest and_always asking if we_needed anything at perfectly timed spots in_the meal
he_made sure_we we_had what_we_wanted and_we_had a_good_time
his recommendations were dead on too especially_with the_wine which they_have quite_a selection
the_decor_is really cool i_loved_the green wine bottle wall
seems_like something i'd see in_nyc or la
it's_very hip love_the color it_really sets the_mood
that's the_other thing it_has_a bar_and that definitely gives it a_bit_of an edge
the_bar was_packed and they_had_a henna artist who_was giving katy perry like henna on hands and arms
someone in our_group said this_was
modern_indian
everyone_in our_group said they'd never_been_to a_place like_this before_and were_really impressed
so_if this_place_is modern_indian sign me_up
i_am_in love with_the_food
flavors
service
decor
best_part_is when our_waiter told_us nothing_was over calories
it_was_like the_music stopped and_everyone turned to_look_at him how could that be
typically more_flavor more calories
but_i actually believe them because_i'm writing this the morning after_our meal_and i_feel terrific none_of that morning hangover from eating too_much
bottom_line best damn indian i've ever_had and actually converted me to_be_able_to say yeah i like_indian modern_indian food
lunch_time and_one waiter is_always_a gamble
lunch took_over an_hour and_all we_had_was apps
the chick_pea ceviche
lentil cakes and grilled eggplant all had the_same over use_of one sauce
plus lentil cakes came out look warm_and the
vindaloo
sauce tasted just_like
rooster
sauce
too_many choices in_the_area
i will_not_be_returning
i'm happy to_be_able_to update my_review
i_do love_this_place the_flavor is unparalleled
they_have changed their_menu yet again
but_now you_can add a_vegetable to_your dish for_only dollar
this is_fantastic
i love_the_chicken keema
curry
rice
and_potatoes combination
its_a delicious explosion of_flavor
the service_can_be spotty sometimes
but come_here_for he food and_flavor
chicken_tikki_masala was_amazing
great_deal on wednesday's for date_night
entrees
app
desert
bottle_of_wine for
highly_recommend
does trendy healthy
well here it_seems_to
while this_is_one_of_the few trendy americanaized indian_restaurant_in_town
the_big star here_for me_is the_menu
vegiteran dishes and_vegan ones are_all marked on_the_menu
in_addition many menu_items can_have the protein of_choice including tofu and_or veggies
and a_choice_of starch
rice
brown_rice or egg noodles
we_had two build you own combos
curry_with mixed veggies_and tofu over noodles
for tofu
the_curry was_a_bit bland_and the noodles to_me were not_the_best match
but if_it_were truly healthy i_would_be ok with the_flavor
the_other dish_was a spinach dish
with mixed veggies_and brown_rice
i_really_enjoyed this dis
as with thai food_you_get to_pick you heat_level so anyone can_eat here
for flavors it_was stars the veggie_options made_it
however_i did miss the_bollywood music i_usually hear with my_indian_food
a girlfriend and_i_have_been meaning to_check bombay_spice out for_a_while but have_never gotten around to_it until last_night
i_found a_great_deal on localdines
com use ref if you sign up
also
checking_in with foursquare got_a us a_deal
we ended_up_going a_little later
ish
so_there wasnt a_wait or_a crowd at_all which_was_nice because_the venue is_a_little smaller
the_bartender was_very_friendly
our serve was_a_little distracted and_took a_little longer to respond to_our needs but_she was_very_nice
we_both_had wine
the
single glass
serving is_actually glasses in_case you_are torn between splitting a_bottle for or_just buying a_glass for
i_recommend_the falling star cab
it_was full bodied and very_yummy
the_other wine we_tried was_the hob nob pinot noir
it_was_great
it_had_a delicious combination_of earthy and_sweet tones to_it
i_am_not very_good with wine lingo
but those are_my unofficial terms that make sense to_me
neither of_us_were very hungry but we_wanted_to sample the fare so_we_could at least see if_we_wanted to_come_back
we_got_to choose either a_free humus or a_dessert because_of my deal_for checking_in on foursquare
power nerd
i_know
i really_wanted to_try_the mango sorbet but we_opted_for the_chickpea hummus and roti bread
for_those of_you
like_me
who aren't sure_what roti bread_is its much lighter than pita_bread and_a_little thinner than_a tortilla
its very_tasty
the hummus was_very_good
and_they garnished it_with diced tomatoes
onions_and cilantro which_i loved
we also_ordered_the seared eggplant
it_was_awesome
it_was_a large slab of eggplant with_a black sauce that_was herby
thats a technical term in_case you_were wondering
they_also served the egglplant with_a yellow sauce drizzled on_the plate which_was sweet_and very_good
in_addition_to a_small scoop_of a_red chili_sauce
our_waitress told_me the_name and_i couldnt remember it_for_the life of_me
which_was spicy
i_really loved_this sauce it was_the_perfect amount_of_spice for the_eggplant
i will_be_going back_here to_try_the curry_and some_of_the_other things on_the_menu i_cant pronounce
there_are a_lot_of vegetarian_vegan dishes clearly marked on_the_menu
their_menu also boasts that_everything
except_for or items
is completely gluten_free
good_experience
definitely looking_forward_to trying_it again_for a_full meal
ehhh it's edible
my_friend tina t
invited me_to join her for_a wine_and henna event that_they host thursday nights during_the summer
for_you get_your st glass_of_wine and_a henna design
while here we_also sampled from_their happy_hour menu
i_have_to_say i_was absolutely impressed_with_the tofu app and_the_garlic_naan
we_also_tried a chickpea_ceviche
the_chicken_tika and_the_tandoori wings
again of_all those the tofu was_my_favorite
the_lady doing the henna designs was amazingly detailed
very traditional henna designs with_a paste that turned a_very beautiful dark burgundy brown
while it_is_not your
traditional
indian_cuisine
all_the wonderful flavors_are present
the_last thing_i want_to_eat when it_is deg out is heavy saags or cream laden indian_dishes
the_dishes here_are light_and flavorful
i_look_forward_to going_back_to another wine_and henna event and would_not hesitate stopping in_for_a bite to_eat if in_the_area
i've_been_to bombay_spice before_and i've_always loved_their food
it's delicious
tasty_and the_service_has always_been wonderful
i_went their recently with_friends during yelp eats and was_able_to have_a_full menu_with wonderful prices
i_got_a groupon_and was_excited_to_try a new_indian_restaurant
we_were_seated right away_and received our_drinks not far behind
there_was one server_and one guy just walking around not_too sure_what his roll was
my_husband_and_i both ordered_the
naan_bread tikka_masala chicken
sandwich
the
naan_bread
was_a tortilla and the_tikka_masala_was out_of_a can
not very_flavorful
the_only_reason why i_knew that_there_were veggies in_the sandwich was_because i_saw them they_also didn't_have any flavor
i_asked_for more tikka_masala sauce due_to_the dryness of_the sandwich and_it arrived just two bites before_i was_done
yes
i finished my sandwich but_that_was because_i_was extremely hungary
we_went to_try_the restaurant due_to_the reviews but_i_was very_disappointed
maybe the_dinner_menu is_better
chris
the_manager
is_great
their
happy_hour items_are unique_and delicious
wednesday nights
they_have_a special for an_appetizer
ewine bottle
entrees_and dessert for
check out_their off deals on www
groupon
com
www
localdines
com
etc
it's_a_great deal_with these coupons
in_short
horrible tasting_food
far_from authentic ofcourse
their selling spiel is_all about_how there_is not butter or oil used
i would_have_been happy by that_as long_as they_make sure the_food_is well_cooked without too_much oil
their concept is_to not use butter oil as cooking medium and_then serve tasteless
undone food
samosas_were bland_and too soft
ofcourse not fried
not_even pan tossed well
bhel_puri was_a sham like the_worst ever
veggie main_dish was tasteless
very low on salt and_spices
if that_is_a health diet need
one could enjoy a_meal there
but_for tasting good_indian_food this_is just_not the_place
i_did the
create your_own entree
white_rice
tikka_masala
lamb
had papadam crisps to scoop up the_lamb
it_was_really_good
i_asked_for extra spice
otherwise they_serve it not so_spicy
it_was_a_bit spicy
but_still could of had a_bit_more heat
on_a_scale of to
i_would_say the_spice was_a
it_was_still delicious
i_ordered_a ginger green tea_and it_had no_flavor
it_was mostly water
rave alert
this_place_has an_awesome happy_hour
i_mean super awesome
the_line on_their_menu describing the_food as
authentic flavors refined
is_too accurate to_improve upon
all_the things_that usually make_me want_to sprint in the_opposite direction of an_indian_restaurant
buffet_style setup
clashing colors
poor presentation
poor_service and funky smells were_not present at bombay_spice
in_other words
the_experience was_much less of_a culture shock for_me
elegant and_modern style decor
dine ware and silverware did_the trick
the_staff_was_very_friendly and_helpful
i_can't_wait_to_go_back
i_had_the indian chai latte
chicken_tikka
samosa_and carrot_halwa
total bill before tip
how_can i not give_this_place stars
i_mean
seriously
what i'd_recommend
going_for their amazing happy_hour
as_well as their indian chai latte
chicken_tikka
samosa_and carrot_halwa
i like_this_place
its not_my_favorite
but_i_will happily go_there
cons
you really_need to_ask questions about_the menu_items
otherwise you_will literally have_a thin layer of peas and_potatoes between a tortilla
pros
the_food_is pretty_good
and_its easy for_a vegan to_find something they_will enjoy
they_have relatively decent wines by_the bottle at low prices and_the_wait staff_is_friendly
bombay also_has special events certain days of the_week
which_is fun
date_night i_believe is_on wednesdays
with_good specials for couples
and_they also_have henna tattooing on another night
clean
good_food
reasonable_prices
very_good service_and tasty_food
the_only_reason_i didn't give_it_a five is because_of consistency
there does not seem_to be consistency in level_of spice
we go_there often and_sometimes spicy means mild to the_cook and_sometimes it actually comes_out nice_and_spicy
at our_table we_had_the chickpea_ceviche which_was fantastic
the_korma
tikka_masala_and curry
all were_very_good
first_time having_indian_food ever
if it's_all like_this and_better
i'm on board with_indian_food for life
almost_everything on_the_menu has calories or less
there's_a vegetarian option to everything on_the_menu
the_food_has no added fats or oil
which_is_a new concept for_me because i_love oils and_butter
the_flavors come from cardamom
cumin
turmeric
tamarind
and etc
constructed in_a way_to bring_out or enhance the_lamb
chicken
lentil
etc
i_enjoyed in_the_food even_more in_the nice modern decor
they_have all_the alcoholic selection display in_a grid like cubical on_the_wall with_a green back light
highly_recommend bombay_spice as_you intro to_indian_food
i'm_sure it_only gets crazier
first_off
i_should_have listened to the_reviews
this_is_definitely an_indian_restaurant_that is catered to first_time indian_food triers
of_course the_flavor will_be bland when using no butter cream in_indian_food
but it_still tasted_good
very_light
if_i_lived closed i_would_definitely come_back_for the_happy_hour
which is_really_good
a_few bucks for small_portions of_different indian_cuisine a
we_ordered from the_happy_hour to_start tofu really_good but_only pieces
samosas yummy for not_being fried and my_bf got_the chicken_wings
he said they_were spicy
we_both ordered from_the create your entree section for our_meal
i_was wondering about_the noodles which_is really odd to_see on an_indian menu
luckily the_waitress said under her breath that_they_are not_good and_then said after
wow i_should really not_have said_that
i appreciaited it_though
i_got_the brown_rice
mixed_vegetables and_tikka_masala
my_bf got brown_rice
lamb and_tikka_masala
the_good thing_is that you_can_eat the_whole dish and_not feel really bloated and_full like regular indian_food
but it_was_a_little bland and_did_not taste_like authentic_indian_food
it_almost reminded me_of_the trader joe's indian_food packs you_can buy there
overall_i would visit this_restaurant if_you_live close_by and order_from the_happy_hour menu
i've gone_to bombay_spice or times
i_keep trying_it because the_first couple_times were awesome
but_the_service absolutely sucks
their new manager is awful
last time_we_were_there our_server put only our_appetizer order in and_not_the rest
our appetizers went accidentally to a_table next_to us who came minutes_after us and_ordered the_same_thing
we then had to_tell them we_did_not get_our apps
after waiting another and getting our apps
we_sat there waiting_for our_dinner only to_find_out they_forgot to_put it_in
their suave manager
who thinks he's the hottest thing around
was_not nice about_it or apologetic
a_couple nights ago we_tried again
i really_do like_the_food and we_wanted_to give_it another go
we brought our week old who_is super well behaved and_were excited for_a bottle_of_wine and_dinner
it_took minutes_for someone to_come take our_drink order
we then waited over minutes_for_our entrees and_there_was nobody in_the_restaurant except_for a large_party on the_patio of women
who the_manager was_super attentive to because_he obviously likes a_table of_good looking ladies since he spent the_whole night checking on_them and_never said a_word to_us
i approached our_waitress to_see when our_dinner may be_coming and_let her know my quiet baby wouldn't_be quiet for much longer
minutes later the_food_came and i_asked_if she_could bring our_check so_that we_could get_that taken_care of
she disappeared
couldn't find her after we_finished our_meal
so again
we_waited
unreal
i_will_never go back_to_this_place
giving_it stars_because i've_always really_enjoyed_the_food
this_was definitely a_hidden jewel
i_am_so glad_that i_found_it on_yelp
the_food_was_great
the_service_was_great_and the_atmosphere_was fun and inviting
they_seem to_have_some great_prices for happy_hour also
i_will_definitely_be_back here
its worth_the_drive
i_love_indian_food
i'll admit that_it's the hardest to_judge
in_my_opinion
due_to_the lack_of what_i know_about it_the complexity of_all_the spices
i_also feel i've been slightly ruined after_eating at_some incredible restaurants in_london
all that_said
i_love_this_place
i've_never_had a_bad_meal here
and_i_was actually motivated to_write a_review because_of_the service we_had this weekend
let's start with_the_food
i imagine that_some hardcore foodies probably think their_food_is not
totally authentic
and_they might be right
however
the_food is_as_good_as i_have_had_in other_places
i_find their use_of spices fresh_ingredients are_well balanced
they have_a_lot_of great_vegetarian options_as_well
the_service there_is always top_notch
as mentioned earlier
our_server this weekend really knocked the_experience out_of_the park
i asked_her about_this hot spice sauce_that is_served
and_she could_see i_was_disappointed to_find_out they_make it_in house
so
not available by some generic name i could_get at_a specialty shop
she_didn't hesitate to_go_to_the back
and_brought be a_small bottle_of it_as_a gift
i_was blown_away
finally
i'll say_that their bottomless lunch on_the_weekends is a_steal
and_a_great way_to_try a_little_bit_of_everything
they_also have_an insanely killer food_selection for happy_hour
i_miss living over by pv mall
because i_could_eat here everyday
been here_many_times for lunch_and_dinner
always tasty
nice_selection
like the_naan
esp
like the_lamb chop appetizer
like_the naanwich
miss_the th and glendale location i_used_to frequent
after seeing some bad reviews i_was reluctant to_try bombay_spice
but i_am_so glad_i_did
the_food_is_not authentic_indian_food
the_server even told_us when_we_were sat that_it_is americanized indian_food
it_is definitely an interpretation
there_was cilantro in_my dish
but_as long_as you_have that understanding before you_go
you_should be fine
they_had an_interesting selection_of beer_and_wine
unfortunately my_husband did_not care for_his ipa and_i_didn't love my glass_of pinot grigio
luckily
the_drinks were_the_only thing_we disliked
i_ordered_the mixed veggies entree with_spinach sauce
since the_server told_me it_was americanized indian_food
i_was worried it wouldn't_be spicy and_i_love a_little heat
you_are able to customize the_spice_level
thank god
so_i_ordered it medium
i_thought_the plating was attractive and enticing
and_the_food_was yummy
not swimming in ghee so_it goes down smoothly
there_was_a delicious smoky grilled taste to_the_food that i_loved
i_wish it_came_with more naan
the_naan_was delicious too
nice_and crispy_and garlicky
you_can definitely taste_the olive oil in_the_food which_i wasn't expected to_like
my_husband_had_the chicken_biryani
he_loved it
the_portions_are enormous
so_i had_plenty_of food leftover for_a yummy lunch the_next_day
the_service_was_great
our_server_was eager
informative
and just_a sweetheart
their brunch and happy_hour sound amazing
unfortunately their happy_hour ends at
so_i wouldn't be_able_to make after work
i_might just_have to sneak out early
i already want to_go_back
the_menu had so_many tasty options
i_love_indian_food
and_i realize this_is americanized indian_food
but_it_was rather delicious
the_menu offers gluten_free
vegetarian
and_vegan_options
i_ordered_the chef's special to_try_the four sauces with_rice
naan
and the_two ingredients in_which one can choose
the_tikka_masala sauce_was definitely_the_best
but the_others had great_flavors too
i_got_the vegan chicken_and mixed_vegetables
it was_so_delicious
and_i_am already trying_to think_of when_i can return
the service_was_ok
it_took_a while when we_were_done
and they_weren't that busy
however
it's_not_a big_deal
very americanized indian_food_with bad bad_service
nice vegan_and vegetarian_options though
i_tried_the chef's special and_the four sauces seem_to be all a_bit off
only_the spinach_curry was any good
any don't go_for_the noodles
i_know
its a_weird option and_as you_know it
weird combo
went out_of_my way driving but a_huge disappointment
i_was_told it_was_the_best indian_restaurant ever by_a woman who_has spent much time in_that country
not_sure what she must_have had
liked what_i had
chicken_biryani i_have_had better
but_the presentation was_a_bit off
sticking papadoms in the_biryani rice made them soggy
why do_that
i_prefer a less trendy place
went_to bombay_spice for_lunch
quick
attentive_service
ordered the_chicken_curry with_potatoes and_rice
it_comes_with naan
food_was_good
not exceptional
not_bad
spice wise
it falls short_of the explosion of_flavors indian_cuisine_is known for
i_would described it_as watered_down indian_food
still may do in_a pinch if_i'm craving_indian
i finally_got to_try bombay_spice grill last_night_and i_loved_it
wonderful service
great unique and_flavorful food_and a_really_nice mellow atmosphere
we_had my_book club there_and the_waitress_was fabulous providing us_with wonderful service and_gave all_of_us separate checks
the_happy_hour prices_are fabulous
i_would_definitely have_the chick_pea ceviche again mmmmm
i_can't_wait_to_go_back and try_more things on_their creative menu
lunched ther today and_asked_for iced_tea
got a_glass_of dark tea
barely spiced
period
ordered_chicken biryani_and the_dish included four raisins
three slivered almonds
two small fresh spinach leaves and loads_of chicken neatly cubed and somewhat dry
my partner's eggplant sat in_a sweet sauce
perhaps the_same_as the_one offered with the_samosas
i_like healthy food
but i_also_like tasty_food and_i expect vegetables to dominate the_meat
i_will_not return to_this_restaurant
i_appreciate the effort_to cut down_on fats
but_the scarcity of spinach_and condiments in_the biryani_is unforgivable
strikes me_that it_came_out of a_large precooked pot in_which the_ingredients had not_been thoroughly mixed
lovely presentation if_that is_your number one priority
i'll take_the tandoori_times any day over this
i_don't_know_what you'd call this_place fusion indian_food
definitely_a westernized take on_indian_food
the_only upside being that they_really seem to_cater_to vegans
vegetarians_and gluten_free diners
but the_food_was_just not_a_good representation of_what vegans
vegetarians or_even indians
eat
terribly bland
i_had_the mango salad which_had no mangoes in_it
i_am pretty_sure it_should have_been called pseudo mango salad
if_i order_something called mango salad
i fully expect some_nice juicy chunks_of the fruit
the boyfriend ordered_a_chicken tikka wrap supposedly wrapped in naan
seemed more_like_a regular tortilla
i_had_a bite
the_flavor_was okay
i much prefer_the nann wraps at_tandoori_times they_are
for_one
definitely wrapped in naan
and_two
exploding with_flavor and_at the_same_price
the_ambiance was_okay
a_modern sort of cafe
the_service_was no good
really slow
and i_wouldn't say particularly friendly
this_was_the_first and last time we'll ever_go
very mediocre food
i_get it's trying to_cater_to the_indian_food novice
but_really
what's the_point
authentic flavors refined
c'mon
you_don't need_to_go overboard on_the garam masala_and ghee but the_lack_of
bombay_spice
was_very evident
there_are far better_indian places_that offer quality_food for the_same_price or less
one_word
bland
we_have kids with_very severe food allergies
dairy milk
peanut
tree nuts
egg
sesame
flax
etc
the_manager patiently worked with_me and made_sure the_items we_ordered would_be safe and free from cross contamination
food_was_great
and
worked just fine for_our allergies
tons_of vegan_options as_well as chicken
beef
lamb
etc
thanks keith and_the_staff at bombay_spice
i frequent bombay_spice for_a_few reasons
i_like familiarity and_they_have a_really_good regular staff
the_food_is healthy
they post ww points
which_is good for_me
and the_food_is_very_good
i_have_never_had a_bad_meal at_this_place
everything_is just really_good
we have_gone to_their sunday brunch a_few_times to_try even_more
which with_the more modest servings allows you to_taste a_variety and_really hone in_on what_you might_have for_dinner or a_lunch sometime
having frequented more traditional indian_restaurants i_don't_want people to_think that_i endorse bombay_spice as the_most_authentic indian_cuisine
i_do know_that it_is_not
but_it has_the preparation and_flavor that_i often find myself craving
so_i_am definitely a_fan
now for some_of_the stereotypical impatient pre madonna pv scottsdale types
you_know who you_are
own up_to it
it is_ok
i_am_from scottsdale too
this_is_not_a speed eating restaurant
bombay by how they_serve food_and interact with the_customers are creating a laid back
enjoyable
social dining_experience
so_that means that it_has_a pace that often americans are_not accustomed_to
bombay fosters an atmosphere where_the customer actually likes who they_are dining_with and wants to_talk_to that person
so_when you_sit there acting all annoyed because_it_is the_end_of_the_meal and you_are waiting_for your check_and you_are getting all agitated
maybe premptively letting the_server know you_need the_check when_they take_your food away etc is_the better approach than getting all huffy
they_are tring not_to rush you
eat at_this_place
it_is healthy
tasty and_relaxing
a_few_months ago i_gave bombay_spice a_bad review and the_manager reached out to_me_and gave_me_a gift_certificate to try_it_again
my_husband was reluctant after_a really bad_experience but we_went_back again a_few_weeks_ago
i've_never_had any issues with_the_food its fantastic
but_the_service_was never good
i_think_the manager has hired some really_great new servers
our_waitress_was so on_top_of it and_we_had_a wonderful dinner
we_went_back again tonight with_a_big group
and_a baby
and_again
super service
feeling optimistic bombay_spice has turned it around_and very_excited that_they_have
henna happy_hour
never_heard_of it
well i'm_a_fan because_it's different
glass_of_wine and_a henna tattoo for starting at pm_on thursdays
we_got_there early to_enjoy happy_hour first which_is pm
glasses_of wine
the_food_was flavorful_but what really made_the experience_is the_staff
everyone_was so_friendly and_easy to_talk_to
suggested things on_the_menu_that they really_enjoyed and helped me make my decision on dinner which i_had_the salmon and_loved
the_weekend lunch_special
is_great
it's_like a_buffet but better because they_cook up your_food fresh as you_want_it
you pick from about five appetizers_and five entrees_and two desserts all you_want
we_tried chick_pea ceviche
lentil towers
and paratha
i_liked_the chick_pea ceviche and the_lentil tower best
the paratha is basically bread
we picked tikka_masala_with chicken_and quinoa and chicken_vindaloo with brown_rice
both_were good with_the_chicken being fresh and_moist
the_tikka_masala had_a_little heat to_it and a_slight sweetness to_it
the_vindaloo_was much_more savory with much_more heat that_did build up
when we_finished our_server asked_us what entree we'd like to_try next but_we declined another entree but decided to_try_the carrot_halwa
the carrot_halwa is_almost like_a pudding but without starch and it_seemed healthy
i_was_told by the_server that_this_is americanized indian_food made heathy style without butter or cream_and nothing is fried here almost_everything is calories or less
the_new times awarded them
best use_of a chickpea
for the_chickpea_ceviche
chef sunil kumar's recipe is posted on examiner
com jon kapoor's
executive chef at bombay_spice
has his recipe for tikka_marsala sauce posted on abc
com sonoran living
the_weekend lunch_special is_a_great introduction to_try indian_style cuisine
this_is_one_of our_favorite places_for healthy
flavorful food
we_love spicy_food and the_vindaloo dipping sauce is_a staple for_us here_as we add it_to just_about everything we_order
for_appetizers
the_lentil cake towers
seared tofu
and baked samosas_are some_of our favorites
although we've honestly never_had anything here that_we haven't liked
the_vegetable naan wrap and_veggie flatbread both have great_flavor and_as far_as the_entrees go
we've_had numerous combinations of veggies
tofu
chickpeas
lentils
etc
with_both the_vindaloo and_hot curry sauces_and all have_been delicious
bombay_spice also_has a_good_selection_of inexpensive wines available_for per bottle that complement the_food well
if this_place_was located a_bit closer_to our house
we'd be_there even_more often given how_many vegetarian_options they_have to_offer
i_am newly gluten_free and dairy free
although_not a_vegan
i'd been dying to_try_a tikka_masala but had_never been_able_to due_to_the common use_of cream in_the dish
i_was amazed to_find_this restaurant had extensive gf and_vegan menu options
our_server
also possibly the_owner or manager
was patient and knowledgeable about_my requests
the_lentil towers were_delicious
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was rich_and savory_and delicious and_even came_with some gf bread for_dipping
i_also loved_the iced_tea
i_look_forward_to returning to_this_place
not_even waiting to_leave the_restaurant before drafting this_review
this_food_is like_a flavor explosion of_spices your tongue has_never met
i_don't_like weird food_or new food
but_after finding out about_this gem at_the scottsdale food festival over a_year_ago
we knew_we had to_try_it_out
after loving it twice
and_now having seen their amazing staff in action i'm_a believer
ordered
chickpea hummus a
samosa a
eggplant a
behl puri a
chickpea_ceviche b
had to_give something less than an_a
only did apps because we_have plans for_dinner
will re do when_we come_back_for date_night
btw
the iced_tea is_to_die_for
full of_spices_and
yeah
i'll shut up now
omg this_is_my_favorite place
great_food
great_atmosphere wonderful
if you're looking_for
really
good
not_greasy indian_food
this_is_the_place for_you
i_highly_recommend bombay for_people who haven't_had indian_food_and want to_give_it_a_try
the_food_is well_priced and_as fresh and_flavorful as_you_can get
if they_had_a bombay_spice in old_town
i_would eat_here every_day for_lunch
went_to_this location because_it_is gluten_free
have_a daughter that_is gluten soy dairy allergic
a_vegetarian and_a vegan in_the family
oh_yeah
one meat_eater as_well
what a_wonderful surprise
the_food_was_delicious
lots_of choices_for all and_the_portions_were a_very_nice size
we_all walked away very_satisfied and looking_forward_to more visits
you_will_not_be_disappointed
i_tried this_place_out with_a_friend recently
and was_pleasantly_surprised
the vibe of_the_place was_a_bit americanized
but beyond that
the_food_was_delicious
catching the tail end_of their pm happy_hour
we_ordered_a half dozen mild tandoori wings for_only
and_they_were amazing
we_also_tried the_lamb_vindaloo and_the_chicken_tikka_masala
and_both_were also_delicious
the_vindaloo
though
is_definitely for_the more adventurous
it's insanely spicy
in total
with tax and tip
we spent around per_person for_a_nice dinner in_a comfortable atmosphere
and our_waitress_was lovely
definitely_worth_a try
and_i'll be_sure_to go_back
i've been three_times now
the_first_time with_a_big group private party where_i was dazzled
the_second_time with_a girlfriend where it_was ho hum
and the_third time just last_week with_the boyfriend where i_was_pretty disappointed
for_the large event
the_quality_of food_was_outstanding
i_was_so excited to_try these_dishes i'd never_had before
at_the_time
i_was newly vegetarian
and my_taste_buds were exploding with every_bite
the_lentil cake towers blew my_mind
and i_couldn't get_enough of_the little bites of heaven
the_second_time
i_expected the_same
outstanding flavors
great_service
and_an overall terrific experience
the_only_thing terrific was the_mango martini
wowie
it's delicious
trying_to maneuver the_menu options_for vegan gluten_free was far too complicated and confusing
i_ordered_the lentil cake towers again
and_they_were delicious
we also_ordered_the seared tofu as another app
and_they_were so_so
i_love tofu
but knew_i wouldn't_be ordering them_again
i_ordered_the vegetable naan wrap
good_but missing
something
the_third time
i insisted we_have the_mango martini
they_were_out_of a_couple ingredients
but the_bartender did what he_could with_what he_had his improvisational attempt was_still delicious
this_time
we_ordered_the seared eggplant which_had great_flavor but_was overcooked_and soggy
the_lentil cake towers
which_were good_but nowhere near_the explosion of_flavor the_previous two_times
and_the vegetable_samosa
which_was_a disappointment
the saving grace of the_third trip was gabriel
i'm_really hoping that's his name
the_bartender and_our_server
he was_attentive_and on_his game
so_much so_that my_boyfriend commented if_he were opening his restaurant here instead_of san diego
he'd snatch gabriel up in_a heartbeat
i_was_really pleased with bombay_spice
it's definitely_not your_typical indian_restaurant setting
think more contemporary american decor
i_mean the smiths were playing on_the stereo which gave_it_a nice relaxing casual vibe
we_were_served by a_great friendly waitress who really knew the_food_and explained everything real well
you_can tell she_was very_excited about_it
we_started_with_the appetizer sampler which_had four selections of appetizers of_your choosing
all_were outstanding especially_the wings and the_chickpea_ceviche
i_then tried the_chicken_tikka_masala which_had lots_of great_flavor and_a_nice kick then_we checked_in on_yelp_and got_a free dessert
great_prices and the_way you_order the_food makes_it really simple
great_little casual place tucked_away in_the corner_of a_strip_mall near pv mall
there_are_some
non traditional
or
americanized
ethnic places_that
while not true to_the country's original dishes
still pull off a_delicious meal
bombay_spice is_not one_of_them
not_only was the_food unrecognizable as_indian
but_it legitimately tasted awful
we_had_the
chef sampler
which allowed us to_try_out of of_the different sauce bases that_the facility provides
we_had_the curry
the_spinach
the_tikka_masala
and the_korma with broccoli and_vegan chicken
pros
the_appetizer
though_it didn't_taste similar_to typical_indian food
was not_bad
we_had_the lentil towers
the_wine selection was_fairly sizeable
the_service_was wonderful
the_curry
though it_didn't taste_like traditional curry
was relatively palatable in_comparison with the_other_dishes
cons
the_naan_is actually toasted pita_bread
the_tikka_masala_was not well_spiced and_was_very sweet
it_almost tasted like over sweetened yams pureed
it_wasn't just disappointing as tikka_masala sauce
it_was_also legitimately disgusting
the_spinach may_have just been salted
cooked down spinach_and water
it lacked any spice at_all
save salt
it had_a_lot_of salt
the_korma was_incredibly sweet
it_tasted predominantly like sugar water_and truly nothing else
the chunks_of mango that_were included in_the_sauce were practically savory in_comparison
needless_to say
this_restaurant_is not_one i_would_recommend
i_just tried bombay_spice for_the_first_time and was_pleasantly_surprised
i've_eaten alot_of indian_food
and_while some_of_the items may_not be authentic
i_still thought the_flavors and_quality were_great
i don't_eat meat_and there_are_plenty_of veggie_options
i'm_really surprised people complained about the_service we_had fantastic_service
i_went with_a_group_of and_we_all ordered the_lunch_buffet
amazing value
it's different_than other_indian_buffets in_that you_order as_much as you_want from_a list_of appetizers
then put together your entree of_choice
all_the appetizers_were tasty
good portion_sizes
for my_entree i_had eggplant and cauliflower curry
which really was_amazing
i_can't_wait_to return
i_went_to bombay_spice not long after moving_to paradise valley from scottsdale
i_knew that_it_was_a 'healthier' indian_food
but_i_didn't know_that meant they_didn't use salt
at_all
got a_cup_of lentil_soup
and_while i_could taste the_spices in_it
it_was watery_and bland
the_texture was_really off putting
the_chicken_tikka_masala with cauliflower was_no better
it_was_a huge portion
but bland bland bland
the 'naan' i_liked
even_though_it is_clearly non traditional and clearly not homemade
i_will_never ever come_back_here and waste my money on bland food again
yes
not_your traditional_indian food_because they_don't use butter
fry things
etc
for some_things that_makes a_big difference
the_samosas for instance aren't nearly as_good as real fried samosas
frying makes everything better
and less healthy obviously
but other_dishes were very_close approximations and_much healthier
was the_tikka_masala as_good as if_it_was loaded with butter
no
of_course not
but_i_thought it_was_still quite_tasty and was_happy knowing that_i_could enjoy a_healthy version_of one_of_my_favorite_indian dishes
the_service_was_pretty good
no_complaints there
looked_like they_had_a huge wine selection_for such_a small_restaurant
if_you_want traditional_indian that's fine
just go_to_a traditional indian_restaurant
so come_to bombay_spice knowing what you're_in for and_you'll be satisfied
went_to bsg for the_second_time friday_night
i_thought_the service_was real good
the_food_is different but_good
reasonable_price
also_good to_see_a manager interacting with customers
i_will_be_back
eh mix and match entree is_not my bag
but try the_vegan lamb
yessssss
and_both the_vegan chicken_and_the seared tofu were wonderful
read_the descriptions of_each sauce before you_order even_if you_know_what they taste_like traditionally
my_first_visit here was_amazing
the_place_is very cute
i_always pass by this_place thinking i_wouldn't like anything on_the_menu
so_i decided_to_give_it_a chance when a_friend recommended this_place_for_a healthy lunch_or_dinner
i_got_the_chicken biryane with quinoa
it_was_delicious
chris was_a awesome server_and super_friendly
it you_are_a local you_get off every_time you come_in
i_will_definitely_be_back
this_place_is in_our neighborhood but_i_don't know_why we_don't go_here more often it_is really very_good
don't profess to_be an expert in indian_cuisine
but do enjoy_it a_lot and_this_place
although_not totally authentic
and that's_not always_a bad_thing
has great_food
the_place_is small compact
clean
with_a modern contemporary d_cor
the
create your entr_e
menu is_a_great idea and_a_nice option
especially to those unfamiliar with indian_cuisine
the_chicken_curry was_very_good
the_chicken_biryani was beautifully present ed and absolutely_delicious
the_menu_is explanatory
and the_servers very knowledgeable about all_of_the dishes
although no_one in our_party is vegan or requires gluten_free foods
having the_option is_a smart thing to_do for restaurateurs to expand their clientele
if_you_are new_to_indian_food
this_is_a good first step
go ahead
don't_be afraid
you_will_be pleasantly_surprised how_good it_is
and the_fact_that bombay_spice offers healthy alternatives is icing on_the cake
we_had_a lovely dinner here_last_night and_we have_never_been anything but happy_with_the food_and_service here
they spice these exactly as_you ask_them and_the_food_is so_delicious and plentiful that_we have_always found_this a_great_place_to dine
we especially like_the ceviche starter which_is always very_tasty_and filling
great_place
i_was_a_little disappointed_that my_server didn't offer me_the bottomless weekend lunch_special
the_weekend lunch_special is_something like
and all_you_can_eat appetizers lunch plates_and dessert
i_had it last time and_it_was_very_good
at_the_time i_thought they discontinued it_but the_table next_to me got the_menu_for it but_i_still had_an enjoyable lunch_here anyway
they_offer an_appetizer sampler plate where_you pick four appetizers for
i_picked chickpea_ceviche
lentil cake towers
chicken_tikka kebab
and_chicken seekh kabab
my_husband liked_the seekh kabab best and_said to_him it_tasted_like sausage and_peppers
i_thought everything was_tasty_and flavorful and_the_chicken_was prepared very_well being moist tender_and flavorful
it_was_a_good amount_of_food but_not quite enough for_two_people so we_shared a_hot chicken_vindaloo
the_vindaloo_was very_spicy and_chicken was_very moist tender_and flavorful
i_thought_this dish_was presented very nicely with_the indian_style bread
naan
and cracker
papadum
this_dish cost
and_i added mixed_vegetables to_the dish for_a
more
i_don't mean to knit pick but if_i'm being totally honest i_need_to mention my_server told_me the mixed_vegetables were a_mix_of the_vegetable choices like cauliflower eggplant and_other stuff but what_i recieved were similar_to frozen mix you buy at the_store
carrots peas corn but_i won't dwell on_that and_let it slide
i'd make a_different vegetable selection next_time
the_food_here_is americanized indian_style food that_is mostly low fat and healthy
they_offer healthy side_dishes like quinoa and brown_rice
no butter or ghee is_in_the house
they_use olive oil instead
the_restaurant_is casual but stylish
they_also are accommodating to vegans and vegetarians
drive_by here all_the_time and_have_never stopped
seen it_in several magazines
great_atmosphere inside
service is_nice_and friendly
had the_weekend bottomless brunch special for
it is_like_a buffet but_you tell them what_you_want off a_special menu_and they_cook smaller portions_of it fresh on_the spot in_the open kitchen that_you_can see while being_seated
you_can basically eat as_much as you_want
i_was_not sure_what to_try but my_server nessa was_a sweetheart and_ask me a_few questions about flavors_and meats and_i let her decide for_me
i_just said hook me_up
had_the lental cake tower
naan_bread stuffed with_potatoes and_peas
shrimp_curry
chicken_tikka_masala_and some type_of carrot desert
i_could of eaten more but_i_was feeling pretty full
great_flavors and aromas
you_can get mild or as spicy_as you_want
food_was_fresh
healthy and presentation_was great
i_can't_wait_to try_more of_the_dishes
i'm_not one_to hand out stars
but_this_place deserves it for_what they_offer
it's_pretty casual
and_there_is nothing jaw dropping about the_atmosphere
but_it's cool and kind of funky
they_have a_variety_of vegan
gluten_free
and generally healthy options
and_the_prices_are so cheap
the_veggie nan wrap is_like
and_the
entrees
more_like_a rice_or quinoa bowl
is around
the_vindaloo is_perfect and_the_curry is spicy
i_love_their lentil tower and_the yogurt_sauce that accompanies it they_even_have a similar vegan style sauce if that's your preference
wine is glass
which i_think_it pretty pricey for_this_place
so we_usually stick_with water or tea
overall
i_love going here_for_a healthy and_flavorful meal
i_have_to_say
this_is really amazing indian_food
i went_on_a weekend for
bottomless brunch
which includes as_many appetizers as you_want
an_entree and_dessert for
i_went_in with_a_friend on saturday around
the place_was_pretty empty and_relaxing for a_saturday afternoon
the_server_was incredibly friendly_and made_some great_suggestions
here_is what_we_got
chickpea_ceviche
a_must
delicious
refreshing
and_much needed in between spicy bites
seared tofu
also really_good
though maybe not tricky enough_to pass the carnivore's test
vegetable_samosas
lentil cake towers
definitely my_favorite thing_that we_got
they_were served warm_and had delicious yogurt_sauce on_them
and those were_just the_appetizers
basically i_was blown_away by everything that_was put in_front_of us
couldn't recommend_this_place highly enough
what_a_great neighborhood spot
recently went vegan and_i_was dog sitting for_someone nearby
i_stopped by_here since_it_was close and they_offered vegan_options
i_was_craving anything curry_and spicy_for weeks after i_went_here
i_ordered_the brown curry_with tofu
it_had huge flavor
very_spicy and_just a_well rounded fresh meal
i_am dog sitting for_the_same people very_soon and_i'll definitely_have to stop_by and_get lunch again since_it_was so_delicious last time
i_also checked_in on_yelp_and didn't_even realize i_got an offer for_free dessert for checking_in
that_was definitely_a plus
server manager was_very_nice_and talkative
i_will_say though
no_one noticed me standing in_the doorway when_i_walked in_for easily minutes
all_the_other guests kept looking_at me_with these pity eyes while_they scarfed down their_food
lol
not_impressed
better_indian to_be had
but probably_not on this_side_of_town
i tried_their tika_masala
bland
so_i added some_of_the hot_sauce to_make_it more edible
i_don't_think i'll go_back
this_is fresh
very healthy
delicious_indian_food that's very_reasonably_priced
the_flavors_are wonderful
despite the_fact_that they_do_not use butter
cream or ghee
and they_don't fry anything
of the_menu_is under calories
my_husband_and_i are suckers for_their rice bowl type system
where you_can choose a_sauce
korma
tikka
etc
a base
rice
quinoa
etc
vegetables_and protein
we've never encountered a_bad combination
so let your imagination run wild
however
if_you_want_a sure thing
get the_korma with quinoa
shrimp and broccoli
the_portions_are large_and taste amazing the_next_day
too
we've tried a_lot_of_the appetizers_and even a_few desserts everything_was_delicious
we_eat here_at_least a_few_times a_month
now
just be_careful when_you go_in to_the tatum restaurant_on a_busy day
you_will_get the_worst service ever
there are_usually younger waiters and waitresses that_are very_nice
but on_this particular sunday
there_was_only one waiter
mid 's dark hair
incredibly rude
i_have_been a customer of this_restaurant since_it opened
and have_always enjoyed_the_food
but_if this waiter or manager
continues to_work at_this_restaurant
they will_definitely loose a_lot_of their business
it's too_bad a rude waiter can ruin a great_restaurant
better_to go_during happy hours only as food_is_not that_much great
expect chicken_tandoori wings
go_for brunch
it's_like a_buffet
but_everything is_cooked fresh to_order
i_loved_the idea_of choosing from_a variety_of_indian sauces to create your_own dish_with meat and_veggies of your_choice
we_had lamb
chick_peas
and broccoli in the_korma sauce on_top_of basmati_rice_and washed it down_with iced indian tea
yum
the_only disappointment was_the gajar ka halwa
which_isn't the_same without ghee
simple menu_that you basically build a_dish from but_it_is very_good
i_only wish_they had_more menu_items
their iced_tea is_very_good
you_can taste the_spices they add_to it
i_am_an indian_and i_have_eaten_at this_place couple_of_times and the_food_here_is not indian_food_but a modernistic type_of dishes_which uses some indian_spices to_give_it_a very very_mild indian_food taste
dont go_there expecting to_get_your chicken_tandoori or spicy chicken_tikka fix as_it ain't gonna do_it for_you
its funny when some_of_the reviewers are referring it_as indian_food
its like comparing taco bell food_with mexican_food
one_of_our visits couple_of years_ago was during their happy_hour which i_thought_was a_good concept
if_you_want real north or south_indian_food
there_are_plenty_of good places in_the_valley
very
very_disappointing
i_liked their previous location and_the_menu
it's sad that they_kept the_same name after_they moved
because_the_food and_the_menu choices are_very poor
it_has as_much relevance to any_indian_restaurant
as_a taco bell to_a mexican place
will never_go_back
chipotle meets indian_food
this_was great
went_here_for a_quick lunch_and it_was_that
great portion_size and love_the choose your bowl
wrap or salad options
the_flavor_was amazing
the_vindaloo sauce did_not_disappoint with_great spice_and just_enough heat for_my_taste
this_is_a_great option for_a_quick health lunch that is_not_a sandwich
excited to_try_more combinations soon
are_you kidding me
i_went_to_this place_for_lunch last_week as_i_was waiting_for my appointment with_the no so genius staff at_the genius bar at_the apple store down the_road
thats another story
but_i digress
anywho
this_place absolutely sucks
indian_buffet scares me anyway
but_this_place takes it_to a_whole new level
the_naan_was dry
the was a_choice_of almost nothing in_the_buffet
i_almost walked out
but_since i_was_there and_wanted_to review
i_couldn't accomplish my mission without taking my_life in_my hands and trying_it
good news
i'm_still alive
bad news is
i_am losing faith that good_indian_food exists in_the_valley
i_had_a very_different experience_here
but_i_did not_order from_the_buffet i_ordered to_go i_had takiki marsala
channa marsala and_some lovely veg samosas
this_was the_first_time_i went_to_this_place the_food_was_good
some_of_the best that i_have_tasted
i_will_definitely_go to this_place_again the_staff_was_friendly and i_guess i_am_going_to have to_try_the_buffet
i_have_been_to this_place times
all for_the_buffet and_all were_good
their_tandoori is_decent
they_always have_some varied vegetable selections and the_tikka is_pretty_good for_a_buffet
they_have_a varied selection_and the_staff_are always friendly_and_helpful
i_like_that you_can get garlic_naan with_the_buffet
i_have nto yet ordered off_the_menu there
i_had_been waiting_for this_place_to open up_for months
its right by_my gym and_i_was stocked to_see_this new somewhat unusual place_is getting ready_to get open
indian_food
yummm
south_indian
hummm
cool
vegetarian
i_am game
so
they finally opened up last_week and we_went_there friday for_a dinner
its_not fancy and_all just_a_few sitting stations on_the big white room with_a_few tvs showing some_indian news
you_order your_food at_the_counter
take_out style
nothing interesting there
but fun starts when_you get_it
sizes_are large
many different_things to_choose_from
there_is_a condiments bar
and
most_importantly
it_tastes really_good
i_mean fingerlickinggood
why stars
service
it_was real good
owner there really_friendly
very_helpful and_even hooked me up_with_a free_mango_lassi
pay next tine
maybe
he said
wow
i_can not wait_to_go_back_and try some_other dish
i_hope_they stay_in business and_i_will_be able to_go_there time after time
you_should check_it_out too
i_like
very_nice
went again for_lunch
yuuummmm yummmmm polished off a_huge bowl_of curry eggplant
its so fucking delicious
hawaiian guy and_indian girl i_went_with loved_it as_well
it_is_a_bit more_spicy then your run of_the mill average indian_joint
so_be aware_of that
i_am sure they_will be_happy_to tone it_down for_you
but_then
of_course
you toning down your experience
i_loved_it as_is
its awesome and_i_am sure as hell coming back
please
p l e a s e do_not listen to retards who bash this_place_for various stupid non related shit
stop_by and try_it
i_brought half a_dozen people there_at various times_and not_one walked away disappointed from actual indian_people to alabama hick
to scottsdale snob to average joe
features a_very large menu with_lots_of choices almost_all between
we each had_a dosai and a_samosa
everything was_very_good
the dosais were large_and filling
all_the chutneys are free with_the_food
the_mango_lassi_was delicious as_well
we'll definitely_be going_back_to try_more
great_for lunch_or_dinner
at_some_point i'll_try one_of_the lunch combos which sound like a_great_deal
as far_as south_indian restaurants go this is_ok
the people_are the_same from_the udupi restaurant_which btw had several health code violations
however if_you_are into indian_food_this
uncleanliness
comes part and parcel of_the
indian
experience
so_if_you disregard the general ambiance
its quite ok in_terms of_its food offering
leaning strongly towards south_indian_cuisine
the_quality_of_the_food varies due_to non standardization of_the recipe
methinks
have_tried the_thali which unfortunately was_cold
cold south_indian food_is_always yucky
i_was somewhat placated with the_various chutney's they_have as_an accompaniment
i give_this_place year tops before it becomes a hovel
clean
bright_and quick
i_came_here_with my_husband
and we_both_had a combo platter that included one masala dhosa
an idli
and_some sambar
it_was_all tasty_and waaayyy too_much_food
i_guess it's_a mixed bag because some_of his friends
they_all work nearby
come_here multiple_times a_week for_lunch
and others swear its awful
as for_me
i_like_the chutney_bar it's_nice to_be_able_to get as_much as you_want
and_i recommend both_the coconut_chutney and the_mint_chutney or
blend them together
like_my mother in law does with_her homemade kind
yummy
i_think this_place_is quite_tasty
but_i won't come_here often
just due_to the_fact_that it's a_major carb overload
and i_wish_the dhosas weren't quite so expensive
i_think they're about
for_one
but
that being_said
it's great_for_a once in awhile treat
idlis
rice cakes
can_be used as a_good weapon substitute
hard and reliable
note
ignore the_reviews above
it_looks as_if there_is some deliberate attempt by_the udupai owners to pose as members and bash this_place
yes
this owner used_to own udupai cafe and udupai cafe is_another dosa house that competes with_this eatery
if you read my other_reviews
you_know that_i'm critical and_my attention_to detail is_there so_i'm_not one of_these people who likes every place he eats at
positives
i'm indian and_i_can assure you this_place_is_good
i_have_never_been to udupai cafe but based on_its failing health inspections
i_would_be scared to_eat_there
woodlands is_a_nice clean eatery in_a nice part_of chandler
it's_not_a restaurant
it's basically a_dosa shop
they specialize in dosa_and offer several types
they_also have excellent indian_chinese dishes
the_food_is consistently good_and i_have_eaten there_on several occassions
this_is_a lunch light dinner place
don't think of_this_place like a_restaurant
there_are several types_of dosa_and that's_what this_place specializes in
the_restaurant_is also modern_and not is_some ghetto strip_mall so_don't worry_about failing health codes here
at least not for_a_while
negatives
their non south_indian_dishes are_not so_good
for non indians
they_should be informed that_this_is a_dosa house so order dosa and_other south_indian_dishes
don't order your_typical indian_restaurant favorites like palak_paneer
it_wasn't good_here
the_owner also says every_dish is_excellent which_isn't true
he is_kind_of a businessman so_he doesn't really care_about telling you which dishes stand_out
stick_to the_dosa and the_vegetable manchurian
their_mango shake wasn't very_good
their chiku shake is_great
very_good_food
i'm not_indian and_i_don't eat_indian_food often
but i_like_it
so_when the_guys at work mentioned woodlands
i_was_excited to_try_it_out
i_ordered_the vegetable_curry dish
you_get a_lot_of curry_and_a small side_of_rice
it was_very_tasty but_could use more rice
the_owner
was_very_nice_and gave our_table a_few sample dishes to_try for_free
i'm glad he_did because_i enjoyed them both
i_am vegetarian so_this will_be on_my 'yes' list_of places_to go_back_to
as_for_the atmosphere
there really isn't any
that's fine
in_fact it's_a refreshing change for_the generic dark indian_restaurants you_have all been too
woodlands reminds me_of_the mysore woodlands in chicago up_on devon street
casual atmosphere_of ordering upon entering
disposable plates containers
and_no traditional server waitress to deal_with
food_is among the_best_in phoenix for south_indian fare and prices_are within reasonable ranges as_well
staff_was_very_friendly
location is_on_the ne corner_of ray rural
facing the_west
i_love_this_place
i'd_love it_more if_it_was a_few miles east
that_is closer to_my_house
the_dosa_was wonderful
the puri with chick_peas was divine
the_thali was_good although the_okra was tough
i_liked my uttapam but it_isn't the_best_i've_had
i_would prefer silverware over plastic and plates over paper
oh_well
woodlands is_my_new favorite stop for indian_food_in_the_valley
what_a treasure
i_was_very_impressed with everything
they_do use styrofome dishware but it_makes for easy cleanup
the_atmosphere_was really fun
an_indian movie was playing as we_ate which added_to the_atmosphere as_well
everything_was very_clean_and picked up
the_staff_were_very friendly_and_helpful as_well
the women that helped us explained what all_the_dishes were and_even gave us seconds of our_favorite without any extra charge
i_will_be a_regular here without_a doubt
the_prices_are great_too
highly_recommended
very_excited to_see_this in_my 'hood as i_used_to drive to south scottsdale to udupi for the_gobi
cauliflower
manchurian and_the decadent puffy bread
who would_have thought you'd crave a cauiflower dish
but you_will after you try_it
there also is_an eggplant_dish that_is divine
this casual place is_the_best for_vegetarian south_indian_food
can't understand any negative reviews
friendly_staff
condiment bar
and_delicious
food
don't_forget_to try a_dosa
many to_choose_from_and the speciality of the_house
i_agree_with pretty much all_the positive_reviews of_this_place
thumbs up_for_the dosai
for the_lassi
and for_the manchurian vegetables
so i'll just chime in to_say try_the lemon_rice
holy wow it's_good
the_portions_are generous
and_the_prices_are pretty typical for food_in_the 'burbs
i_also agree that_you shouldn't go_in expecting_a
dinner out_on_the town
experience
i'm intolerably picky_about lighting
so we_took ours home
and we_just kept pulling containers out_of_the takeout bag with incredulous expressions
in_addition_to the_entrees we expected
there_was soup
three kinds_of chutney
an unexpected side_of plain_rice
like_i said
they aren't stingy
and in_case you missed it
lemon_rice
it's my_new constant craving
very_disappointed
the_dosas were greasy
sambar too_salty
idlis dense
on_top_of all_this
they_are expensive and_in no_way eco friendly
all items_were served_on styrofoam
since when can restaurants not wash a_few_dishes
never returning
after_reading reviews
i_had trouble deciding what_to_order
as_a recently converted vegan
i_have_been shy to_leave the_house and_try eating out
as i_am hesitant to trust that_all ingredients are vegan
as_it turns out
woodlands_is perfect_for people like_me
they_have_a vegan coded menu
where all vegan_dishes are marked with a_star
making_it that_much easier to determine what's
safe
for_me_to eat
they_have delicious drinks prepared for the_mango lover
they_also have pepsi products in_a fountain
they_use styrofoam plates_and cups
the_staff_are friendly and_prompt
our hot dishes were_brought to_our_table minutes or_so after_ordering
i_sampled three sauces from_the chutney_bar
i_loved all_three
the_green one was_spicy_and the_red one_is a_creamy tomato
the black one is_like_a tamarind_sauce with_a pop of sour fruit taste
we_ordered poori bread
which_comes with_two huge puffs of_fresh bread
we_couldn't finish_it
the_potato dosai was_out_of_this_world good
if_you_like aloo naan_bread
you_will really_enjoy this_dish
my_friend_ordered the_eggplant curry
and_it_was as delicious if_not better_than my dosai
wow
i_am planning to come_back_again this weekend with_the boyfriend
so_delicious
i_can't stop raving to_everyone about_it
as_a person_who enjoys
medium
spiced foods
i_was very_happy_with the_level_of spicy ness in_the dishes_we_ordered
i'm not_sure when this_place opened
but_i cannot believe it_took_me this long_to get_here
they_have a_ton_of vegan_options and several gluten_free options which make them hella rad in_my_book
this_is_a pay at_the_counter and_eat off_of paper_plates type_of place
which_is fine by me because_it keeps the costs down and_the_portions large
i_had_the gobi_manchurian
so amazing
and_the spiced rice
my_dining partner had one_of_the platters and she_was loving every bit_of it
i_will_be_back
watch out
i_went_to_this restaurant after a_recent health kick
and had_heard some_good things
so_i_decided_to check_it_out
the_restaurant_is more_of_a order at_the_counter
fast_food looking atmosphere
i_ordered_the gobi_manchurian
and_the paper masala_dosai
let me just_say
the_gobi_manchurian is_one_of_the_best things i've put into my_mouth
and_it's vegan
the dosai came to_our_table
and_it_was unbelievably big
humorously so
but really_tasty
the_staff_was really_friendly
and_i_can't get_enough of the_bollywood music_videos
really great_food
will_be_back
i_am_a meat_eater
but_when_i do_have to_eat vegetarian
i_prefer south_indian_cuisine
woodlands did_not_disappoint in_that department
i_cannot tell you_what i_ate since my_friend did_the ordering
but_everything was_really_good
we_had chick_peas
a_huge bread_that took up most_of_the table
and
hamburger buns
with tasty potato filling
i_am sure i_can close my_eyes
point at something on_the_menu_and still find the_dish enjoyable
expect a_very casual restaurant where_you order at_the_counter and_eat from disposable plates
this_would also be a_great_place_to order take_out from
been_to_this location many_times
both lunch dinner
and_the_food is_always_good and_filling
i'm_a_huge fan_of_indian_food
both north south
and_this_place_is right_up my alley
great_food
great_prices
speedy service
and_always made to_feel welcome by_the friendly lady behind the_counter
i've even ordered food_from here_for_a company luncheon event and_everyone loved_it
have_taken many out_of_town guests here and_everyone is_always impressed w the_food
i've_been_to many_other indian_restaurants_around the_valley
but_this_is the_one_i always come_back_to
the_following are_some of_my_favorites from this_restaurant
curry eggplant
palak_paneer
malai_kofta
vegetable manchurian
naan
dosa
i_really_enjoyed the_food_here
we_stopped_in for_a casual dinner after_being highly_recommended
i_left happy
and way_more full than i_had anticipated
all those light
airy dhosas are deceptively filling
another reviewer was on_point by saying_that this_spot isn't really a_restaurant
but_more of_an eatery or dhosa shop
you_order at_a counter
take_a seat
and_your food_is brought out_to you
pitchers of_water are self serve and_there_is of_course a soda fountain
there_is_also a chutney_bar where you_can explore to_your heart's content
we brought_a sample of_each back to_the_table
each were_delicious and_fresh
i_got_the palak_paneer
which_was_delicious
my_friend_ordered one_of_the giant table sized dhosas
of_which they_were happy_to tone down the_spice at her request
all in_all
everything_was_great
the_only_thing_i wasn't_too crazy about was the_plastic
everything
our_food_was served_in dixie bowls and_all_the silverware was plastic
it sort of felt like we_were camping
the_space is_clean_and bright
i_think some real dishes_and silverware would really round this_place_out
at_any rate
i_will_be_back
the_place_is a cross between a_takeaway joint and_a diner located_in_the heart of chandler
az
woodlands serves authentic south_indian_cuisine
i_would certainly recommend_the place_if_you happen_to be around chandler and_have a_craving_for some_good dosas or_if really hungry
a_south_indian thali
four star_for ambience
five_star for the_food_and_service
once you_get past the_average looks the_food_is_great
it_also comes quick
sort of like_an_indian fast_food_joint
oh i_am sorry
did you_want some_food
this seems to_be_the common theme at_all indian_food places
i walk_in
always seem to_be_the only or nd customer and_the help seems disturbed they_have to_work
it_is just awkward
this trip was no_exception
i_walked_in and looked_at the_menu_for several minutes having no_idea what to_get
or how_much to_get for dinner_for hungry men
i_decided_to start_with one_of_the potato filled triangle crapes
and_then for_our_main dish i_got and
the_first issue we ran into was_the soda machine
as they_did_not expect customers there_was no ice in_it yet
our crepe came
it_was_pretty_good
and it_came_with a_cup_of sauce_which we_found out was sauce
a crispy crape with_a flavorful potato filling
there_are many interesting condiments to_add to your_food
i_really_enjoyed_the spicy red one with carrots
our main_dishes then came
they looked identical
felt nearly identical and_almost tasted the_same
they_were fried soft chucks of_veggie mass covered_in a_sweet crust and_a semi spicy_sauce
you_could have told_me they_were chinese_food and i_would_have believed you
all_of_the grease was_a_bit too_much_for me and_i cold not finish
also for_people is_a_bit steep of_a order at_a counter place
main_dishes are and chipati was i_would think for_one should get both
please tell_me what should i_order
we_ordered_the two dinner combos even_though_it was lunchtime on_sunday
the_two employees were_really slow to_take_our_order yet the_food_came to_our_table as_soon_as_we got_a pitcher of_water and_a sample of_each thing from_the chutney_bar
you bring_your_own pitcher of_water and your_own plastic forks and spoons to_the_table
we_went_in starving and_left stuffed
it_seemed that more experienced couples ordered just_one dinner combo and shared
that_would have_made more sense once_i saw the_amount_of_food we_had
plus it_would_have cost less
we_got no drinks for_appetizers and the_meal_was
i_loved_the crepe thing with potatoe in_it
since the_menu doesn't really_have descriptions i_don't_know_what i_ate but everything_tasted okay
i_didn't love most_of_it and_i_didn't really hate anything
not_sure i_would_go_back
it_felt almost buffet_style without you choosing which things from_the_buffet you_want
i_prefer other_indian_restaurants
we_usually do takeout because the_interior_is pretty drab
but_the_food_is anything but
i_have_eaten a_lot_of indian_food_in many parts of the_world
london
new york
toronto
and this_restaurant_is one_of_my_favorites
though a notch below chutney's on drummond road in_london
i_highly_recommend_the dosas
all are_good
and the_vegetable_curry is unbelievable
i_am_not_a vegetarian
but_if all_vegetarian dishes_were as_good as those at woodlands
i could_easily convert
great_food
very_tasty_and fresh
we_loved this_place_and will_definitely go_back
incredibly good_food_and big portions
this_is heaven for_vegetarians i tell you
i'm_not vegetarian far_from it
but the_flavors in these indian_dishes are_so phenomenal that woodlands definitely ranks as one_of_my_favorite eateries in_the_area
i'm_always up for_something new
and every_time_i eat_here the_owner takes time_to educate me_on new items to_try
quick tip
try_the masala_dosai and_the samosa_chaat
masala_dosai and samosa_chaat are legit
good tasting_food
authentic flavor
i drive to artesia
pioneer blvd
sometimes just_to fulfill my_indian veggie food cravings
ok not_really
but_i do visit every_time i'm_in la
this_place compares favorably to those places
they_have_some interesting dishes_that are like whitified versions of masala_dosai
like
pav bhaji dosai
maybe this_really exists in_india
i_don't_know
i_wasn't born there_and i_haven't_been there
but i'd_like_to think i'm very_well connected with my_parents culture
i_appreciate my_indian heritage and culture
anyways
i_was_surprised that_the pav bhaji dosai was_actually really_good
sambar is_decent too
chutney_bar is_good
but_i_think its a_little lacking
service is_kind_of
i_don't_know
not_very welcoming
typical_indian style
if you're indian
i_think_it will suffice
but_if_you aren't you'll be weirded out
phoenix really lacks south_indian_food places
this_place somewhat makes_up_for that
pricing though is_not very appealing at_all
for a_dosa with sambar is wayyy too pricey
so_much so_that this might deserve a_star
but_i gotta show some love for_indian_food
i_am of_indian origin
so_i_am picky_about indian_food_at restaurants
i don't_eat out much at indian_places
so_i haven't tracked ownership changes or what that_has done for_indian_cuisine
i_ordered_the malai_kofta
which_was
might have_been reasonable if it_had come_with a_decent portion_of rice
and_had more_than kofta balls in_that tangy sauce
or_if the_extra rice in_a thimble wasn't
i_have_had giant food portion for_at sit down restaurants with amazing ambience
i_am_not saying the_place_is expensive
just_that the_portion_was way_too tiny even_for cheap places
you_have_to order at_the_counter
eat off flimsy paper_plates that tip over at_the slightest touch and_clean up after you but_there_is a_large tip blank on_your bill which you_have_to sign in_front_of_the attendant
and_if_you eat at_indian_restaurants
you_know well about the_service that leaves you squirming
woodlands was no_exception
the chutney_bar was a_decent idea the_tomato chutney was_actually good
i_have sort of given up_on decent sambhar or chutney
i_suggest taking the effort_to drive out a_couple more miles to little india in_tempe
for
you_get that same quanity of subji
two rotis
large portion_of pulav and pickle
this_review_is mainly for americans
indians just get desperate and eat_at such junkyards
like_me
firstly
its owned by an_indian and they_just want quantity and_no quality at_all
he did_not allow me_to order_from_the kids menu
as i_was_not under yrs
yes
he_was that desperate and disgusting
even_when i_told_him that the_big dosa_is too heavy for_me
he didnt budge
now for_the_food
being from bangalore and udupi muself
i_really know_this kind of_food
its like eating a_hot dog when you_go into an italian restaurant
chutneys cannot be stored for_a_buffet
its impossible with_the rate at which coconut degrades
except the_tomato one
so your not eating chutney
but_just some stale mustard sauce
the_food_is_so lame
i_dont know_what_to say
but the_perfect recipe to fool americans and desperate indians
its also too_spicy_for american standards and thats too_bad
oh_and avoid their frozen lassi
its nothing_like a_mango
india_is famous for alphonso mangoes
but_this_is soooo horrible
better off at buying mangoes from costco and eating_it raw
i'm_not_a veggie but_i tend towards veggie food_and_i do love_indian_food
i_loved_the chutney_bar
the_only variety i_wasn't crazy about was the_tamarind but that_could have_been just me
the_portions_are amazing for_the_price when they_brought a_huge plate_of air filled naan
we_were amazed and impressed
i_have already recommended it a_few_times_and will_be_returning
the_best_indian_food_in arizona
bar none
and especially considering_the prices_and portions
the young guy at the_cash_register was_incredibly nice and_gave my_girlfriend_and i a free_mango_lassi because_he forgot_to offer me coffee tea with my_meal
the_food_was spicy
savory
sweet
and succulent
the chutney_bar is_a_great idea and_were likewise delicious
i forgot_to tip for_all_the good_food_and friendliness
but_i'll be_back very_soon and_they will_certainly have a_couple repeat customers
and a_generous tip
i_highly suggest this_restaurant_to anyone that loves indian_food
and doubly so to those who_are tired of_the exorbitant pricing of_indian_restaurants in_the_valley
i_am south_indian by background
parents are from south_india
this food_is_very similar_to what my grandmother
from kanniyakumari
would_make
just_that my grandmother would_not make as elaborate sometimes
if you_were to_ask me about_the_food
i_would_say it_is_good
but_my grandmother cooked better
as far_as what my_wife_and_i ate
here_is the breakdown
i_had_a mysore masala_dosai
this_is very traditional from_the mysore area in_india
where my mother's side_of_the family hails from
the dosai was_very similar_to what_i_would eat in_india
though a_bit_more elaborate
my_wife
who_is vietnamese by background
ordered the_spinach dosai
she said_it_was good
as_she is used_to south_indian_food
i_never really did see spinach dosai in_india before though
regardless
if a_person is adventurous
and you_are_not expecting the_standard north_indian mughlai fare
this_place_is worth_going to
i_would_go_back
the_atmosphere_is more_like_a fast_food
or cafeteria
but the_food_is_good
i_do_not want to_compare it_to elsewhere
as even i_would_say other_places i_have lived_in the usa
including chicago
have south_indian restaurants that_can perhaps compete with_this_place and win
for the_phoenix_area
this_is good_though
we_have lived in_the_area for_years learned of_this_place only months_ago
turns out it_has_been open for_years upon talking with_the gentleman running the_place
my_wife is vegan
i_am_not but always up_for tasty grub
this_place did_not_disappoint
i_had_the chole dosai while my_wife_had the vegtable curry
we also_got a_side_of malabar parotta
bread naan
which is_to_die_for and_could be_a meal_in itself
we_were_both so impressed_with portion_size
left_overs came home_for a_much anticipated lunch the_following day
flavor
loved_the chutney_bar
and_friendly_service
the gentleman on multiple occasions queried about or satisfaction
i give_this_place_a very solid
maybe
the_only_thing_that would_make it better in_my_opinion is_the ability_to order an indian_beer and_if the_prices_were a_little lower
the_atmosphere_is on_the casual
informal side which_i like
our_dinner was_for with leftovers
very_reasonable for dinner_for_two
really_good food_but not_much ambiance
i_was with some_indian co_workers who helped me order gluten_free
went for_a_late lunch on_a_saturday afternoon
probably about pm
i had_to_wait_for minutes_for someone to_take my_order
looked like_it_was the_manager or owner
he_was polite
informed me they_were_out_of a_few_things already
thought_that was poor planning being_a holiday weekend and a_saturday afternoon
but nonetheless
the_food wass fresh_and good
the_sambar could_have_been_a little thicker and was_hoping for_the_food_to be_a_little hotter
temperature related
will visit_again when_i_am in_town
i_must admit
i_was_pleasantly_surprised to_have thoroughly_enjoyed everything_i ordered
i_can't_remember the_last_time that happened in_a restaurant_in_the_valley
to_start
the_ambiance_is non existent
so if_you_want_to impress a girl on_a first date
this_isn't the_place
however
if_you_want_to eat food_that
wows
you
woodlands is_the_place_to come
i_ordered_the samosa as_an_appetizer
and_then the_veggie curry
along_with an_order_of malabar parotta bread
the_samosa had so_many spices_in it_that it_was_great on_its own
however
there_are_plenty_of delicious chutneys to_choose_from
i_loved_the mint and_coconut
there_was_also_a spicy one with chunks_of veggies in_it that was_good
the_curry_was fantastic
spicy and_full_of_flavor
i_get annoyed when_i order spicy in_an_indian_restaurant
and_then after_looking at me they_serve it to_me mild not_here
it was_just_right
the_bread_was excellent too
so_was_the mango_lassi
though_i really_wanted a taj_mahal no alcohol here
so besides the cafeteria environment and_no alcohol or table_service
this_place_is_great
because they_serve great_food
we_tried masala_dosa
grill thali and_mango_lassi
the_food_was fresh_and the_taste_was it_should_be
the_quantity was_very_good
we_will defienetly go to_this_restaurant again
i_am_from north india
but a_big_fan_of south_indian_food
first dosa experience_and it_was_wonderful
definitely_going back
omg
i_feel_like i'm on_a role with finding half decent_indian_food
after_being here for_over years
i'm either finding some_good places or my_taste_buds have lost their touch
since_i refuse to believe_the later
i was_very_happy with_this_place
great_place_for dosa
finally i_don't_have to_make_it myself
seriously legit dosa
we_ordered rasam
the_grill thali and_a rasmalai
the_grill thali is_about and is_a_good start if_you_want_a general idea_of what_to_order in_the_future
it_came_with masala_dosa
idlli
vadai
sambhar
and a_sweet
gulab_jamun
great_value for what_you_get
the_masala_dosa was_on par
vadai was_made well
idlli was_a_bit dense and_dry
sambhar was flavored well
and gulab_jamun was_not frozen
i've_found way_too many_places that store it in_the freezer and_it kills me every_time
the_spice_level of_the rasam was_good_but felt like_it_was missing something
possibly tamarind
the rasmalai was_made well
but a_little_bit sweeter than i'm use to
all_this for approx for
my tummy was_happy
woodlands_is not_the_best place ever
but the_dosa_was good enough_to make_me want to_come_back to_try_the other types_of dosa
everything_else_was satisfactory and edible
i've noticed a_lot_of ppl critiquing the_decor
but heck
it_looks_like a_lot_of_the great places_in artesia
the_little india area located_in l
a
so please don't_come_here if you're_going_to be critical of_the cafeteria style
in_the months since_i have found_this_place i_have_eaten here more_than once_a_week
i_think even if_you_are_not vegetarian they_have the_best_food on this_side_of_town
the_staff_are very_nice_and the orders are filled promptly whether you_eat in or carry_out
i_have brought all_of my_friends_and family here_it is_so_good
we_have_a running joke that_you_can just point to the_menu_and get something
the_real standouts to_try are
gobi_manchurian deep_fried cauliflower
chenna batura chickpea_curry
spring dosa rice_and lentil crepes
potato bonda breaded potato dumplings like samosas
the_place isn't super fancy
it's a_simple strip_mall restaurant_with really_friendly people
i_don't find_this_place very expensive and_you_get a_ton_of_food wether you_eat in or carry_out
i've done both many_times
only_one word_of caution some_of_the stuff can_be very_spicy some days
so be_a_little adventurous and_try one_of_the_dishes above i_don't_think you_will_be disappointed
we_are vegetarians_and found woodlands the_day_we moved_to the_area
we_got_the butter masala_and_the vegetable soup
got take_out
the_portions_were big_and prices_were good
the_masala was_wonderful creamy
savory
extra tomato y
and a_little_bit spicy
which_was perfect
i_ordered_the veggie soup for_my lady who_was sick that_night
and_it ended up being_the ideal thing
delicious broth
not too_spicy
kind of_like the_indian equivalent of a_good chicken noodle soup
but vegetarian
we_will absolutely be ordering from woodlands again what a_nice introduction to the_phoenix_area
edit
we've just ordered_take_out from woodlands again
probably will happen pretty often
and_got the_vegetable_curry which_was nearly as fantastic as the_masala
the_order came with_a_couple yummy sides
a yogurt_sauce and_a gingery concoction
we_also got_the lentil_soup this_time and_wanted_to post a warning to fellow yelpers
this soup is_so so_so so_spicy
i_absolutely_love spicy_food and_couldn't finish_it
not_for_the faint of heart
went_here_for lunch with_a coworker
and totally loved_it
the_service_is weak
the_decor_is weak
the process is confusing
the details are lacking
you_get cheap paper_plates
if_you_want water
there's_a pitcher
it_has about_as much ambiance as_a circle k
and it_would_be easy_to think they're doing everything wrong from a_restaurant experience perspective
but_they totally made_up_for_it with_the_food
i_had_the spinach dosai
and it_was_awesome
and_i'm no vegetarian
my_mouth is watering right_now thinking_about_it
i_wanted_to go_back_for dinner that same day
i_actually want_to go_back_for dinner right_now
so
a carnivore goes into veggie restaurant
no
seriously
this_is great stuff
i_have_a friend who's a_veggie and loves indian_food
so_when i_noticed this_place sandwiched between a hair salon and_a pizza chain
i_had_to tell her
we checked it_out tonight
and damn
the_gobi_manchurian is_amazing
especially_with the_mint_chutney
the_spinach dosai is_very_good
but_a bit_dry
not_that that stopped us_from fork fighting over the_last bits
this unrepentant flesh eater went away completely happy and_didn't miss the_meat at_all
think i'll be_coming back at_least_once_a_week
i'm a_regular to_this_restaurant
being a_south_indian myself
i_can vouch for_their great_quality south_indian_food
my favourites here_are the venpongal vadai
combo variety rice_and vegetable uthappam
the_food_is decently priced
delicious
served quickly_and the_manager is_very_friendly_and willing to_serve
though this_is_a small_restaurant
ive never had_to_wait to_be_seated
there_is not_much of_an ambience
but_the_food makes_up_for_it
woodlands is_one_of_my_favorite places to_grab lunch
i_first learned about_it from_a fellow indian coworker who_was vegetarian and_that_was the_only_place he frequented
it's_a pretty plain joint
not_too big on_the decorations
you'll note
but_the_food_is outstandingly flavorful
now don't_be fooled and think_that just because_it's vegetarian that_it is_going_to_be completely 'healthy'
that is_a_very common mis conception and_can really eff up_your 'diet' if_you_have that mindset and eat_at places_like this frequently
cuz i tell ya
they_are pretty generous with not_only the_portions
but to_give food some sustenance
you_can bet they_use cream or ghee
basically butter
to thicken sauces up and_the likes
this_food_is flavorful
for_sure
but low in calories it_is_not
i_have_tried a_few_of their thalis
basically sampler dishes_which lets you_try a_variety_of things in_one sitting and_in smaller portions
but_still really filling
the_palak_paneer
the currys
the_aubergine dish called bharwan baiga
gobi manchuria
they_were_all super delicious
though the_aubergine dish is_still my_favorite
plan_on taking leftovers
oh_yeah
and_the_prices_are pretty_decent and_the_staff_is pretty_good
too
i tried_this_place based solely on_the reviews
turns out the_food_was_delicious
and_the_prices_are more_than reasonable
i_paid
and ended_up_with enough_food to feed three people
i_will become a_repeat customer
for_sure
in_short
south_indian veg
great_taste
quick_service
low price
no ambience
no specific seating arrangements
served_in plastics
details
every_week we_used to_drive miles from scottsdale to chandler just to_eat_in woodlands and come_back
and_my roomie always
and_always
eats pongal n vada
while_i try_out new dish every_week
the_food
esp
dosa
s
pongal and chole
is of great_taste and_quality
the_quantity is so_much more_than you_could expect
the_food_comes to_your_table super quick
the_prices_are very_reasonably low
the_owner_is very_friendly
there_is no appreciable
or_even noticeable
ambience
the process is
pay the_bill then get the_food
no specific seating arrangement
served_in plastics
bottom_line
this_is_a place_where you dont take you gf or your boss to impress them
this_is_a place_where you treat yourself with great_food with low cost
enjoy_the taste_and forget everything else around you
ohhhh mama
just thinking_about woodlands makes my_mouth water
i_know everything my_boyfriend has ever_had there he_has loved
he tries out new_things every_time there
i
on_the_other_hand
just stick_to what_i know and_love and crave
the_vegetable manchurian
it's spicy
delicious
deep_fried vegetables with_a_nice cold dipping sauce_on the_side
the_price_is great for_the awesome amount_of_food you_get
one order is_usually two dinners for_me
sometimes more
ambience_is lacking
but_we tend to_take_our food to_go
i_just_wish they'd open a location closer_to tempe
trust_me
you don't_go here_for_the ambiance
there_is none
well
unless_you count the tons_of indians who frequent the joint or_the occasional office troupe that takes over one corner
or_the couples in_for_dinner
well basically it's_a good_place_for anyone
what makes woodlands stand_out from_the other_indian_places in chandler
some that do_have 'ambiance'
is_that woodlands brings the_heat
the chutney_bar has_a white coconut_chutney that both cools and_has_a slight kick
a_red tomato chutney with_a low soft burn and good_flavor
and my_personal favorite
the_green mint_chutney that_will knock your socks off
i_only come_here_for the_dosas
the_masala_dosa and_the mysore masala_dosa are_both very_good
it_seems_to me_that they_use frozen vegetables
but the_masala has_never tasted bad so there's really no downside
everything is_nice_and hot when they_bring it_out
although sometimes the_sambar
a soup like dish
might_not be if_it wasn't_as freshly made
their vadas
spicy
savory fried lentil cakes
are_pretty good_too
i_haven't_tried much else but why deviate from_what works
the_owner_is really_nice_and will chat_with you on_what to_get
family history
etc if_you_want
i_wish_they were open later
and_on tuesdays
if you're used_to sit down 'classy' restaurants_and waiter service
well
you_might find_this_place 'lacking' but honestly
these sorts of_places focus on_what matters what's on your_plate rather than what's on_the_wall
this_is pretty much as_good_as_it gets in chandler
what this_place lacks in interior design
it makes_up_for in deliciousness
like_other reviewers have_said
this_is_not_a fancy place
the person_who takes your_order is_not_the most outgoing guy on earth
if_you_want water
you grab_a pitcher that_they probably bought at wal mart and_drink your water from a_small styrofoam dixie cup
you_eat off_of styrofoam plates_and bowls
i_don't_care
the_food_is_awesome and_you_get a_ton_of it for_the_price
i'd eat at_this_place if_i_had to_sit on_the_floor and_eat with_my hands
i always_order the_palak_paneer it's very_good_and super_spicy
i_love_it so_much i'm afraid_to try anything else
the_meal comes with_rice
i'm_not sure_if they_all do though
if_you_want bread it's extra
great_food
and_well worth_the_drive to chandler
easily the_best_indian_food_in arizona
my_wife_and_i come_here frequently and always_get_the vegetable_curry
keep up the_good work
if_you_are vegetarian
this_is_an oasis in_this desert
if you_just crave something outside_of_the norm
this_is_the cure
the_food_is spicy and_delicious
prices_for specialty food are decent
the_decor_is not exceptional
and_the utensils are plastic
but the_quality_of_food makes_up_for_it
i_have_had the paper masala_dosai
paneer dosai
vegetable_curry
vegetable manchurian
my_favorite
vegetabel byriani
vada pav and_they_were all_delicious
i_recommend you_go with_a_friend so_you_can try a_couple_of things
they_have_a chutney_bar that_is quite delicious_and adds yet another layer of_flavor
pretty_good food overall
there's_a chutney_bar as_well
however
if you're looking_for_a nice sit down place
this_is_not what you're looking_for
everything_is served_in styrofoam
but_if you're just looking_for some_good grub you_can get_it ehre
dosas
yummy
so_great for vegans too as everything_is labeled
my_wife_and_i wanted_to check_this_place out after_reading some_of_the reviews_on_yelp
first
because we're trying_to watch what_we eat these days
and_also
to_try_something different
we_were_not_disappointed
we aren't too familiar_with_indian_food
and other_than the_usual curries and_lentils
we_had_no idea_what most_of_the stuff was on_the_menu
rest assured
the_food_was_fantastic
but perhaps a_bit spicy_for my_wife since she is_not accustomed_to hot foods
in_any case
the_food_was filling
spicy
and_tasty
if_you_are looking for_something different_and something healthy and_vegetarian
give_this_place_a try
my_first impression
wasn't_too good_as_it looked not so_good
they_really should fix up the_place
the_food on_the_other_hand
great vegetarian_menu
dosa was_tasty
had also dahl with_rice
very_good
they_even_have choices of_chutney
i_do recommend to_anyone
even meat_eaters
finally writing a_review after i_have_been eating_here for_a_couple years now
this_place_is hands_down_the best south_indian_food you will_find in_the_valley
they_do such_an incredible job with the_spices
the_owner is_really_nice
he remembers that i_cannot eat raw onions
they_did_not even know that_they_were nominated for best vegetarian restaurant this year in the_new times
it_was_just business as_usual
do_not go_here expecting to_have_a fine dining_experience
you_order at_the_counter
either take_it to_go
or sit_in the_dinner atmosphere and_eat some crazy good_food
friendly atmosphere
lots_of families in to_eat
everything_is great
but the_paneer butter marsala is one_of_my_favorites
one_word for_this_place
yummmmy
i give_stars for_the_food
we_had_the chole masala dosi and pav bhaji masala dosi and_they_were delicious
love_this_place
this_is top_notch
delicious_food
my_friend from mumbai told_me that_it_is as
authentic as_you_can get_here in_the_us
and_i_believe her
here's the_thing
heretofore i_couldn't eat_indian_food
whereas my_wife would_have had_it fed to_her intraveneously if possible
now
when we_go_to woodlands
i_eat everything_and love_it
paneer_is phenomenal
chenna battura
sp
brings a tear to_my eye just thinking_about_it
i_have_ordered
devoured
and thoroughly_enjoyed about of_the_menu
to further expound
i_could give_a crap about ambiance
as long_as i_am_not in_a dangerous or filthy place
woodlands_is immaculately clean_and in_an upscale chandler location
really could_not care less about the_lack_of interior decor or the_fact_that they_use styrofoam cups and plates
which
from_what_i understand
is_a significant
upgrade
from_what you_can expect in_a south_india marketplace
not here_for_a luxurious dining_experience
just to_eat
and_eat i_do
in_a clean
friendly
well served location that offers delicious
authentic_indian_food
ps
if you ever travel outside_the us you'll find_that about of the_world doesn't eat_in restaurants like our spoiled fat butts they eat_in a market or order_from street vendors
compared_to this
woodlands_is off_the chart in terms_of luxury and_taste
and
again
compared_to all other indian_food
which i_could_not eat before
this_is_the_best
prices cannot be beat
go_there and check_it_out
my_favorite_indian takeout place in_the_valley
i specify takeout because i_wouldn't necessarily eat_there at_the_restaurant
as other_people have mentioned
the_decor is_kind_of generic and odd
the_food
however
man
so_good
i_especially recommend the_butter paneer_masala
pretty reasonable priced
too
very_nice setup
great food_and_service and_very reasonable_prices
looks can_be deceiving
the_interior_is
well it's a_restaurant and_they_have tables
that's about_as fancy as it_gets
however
the_food_is absolutely incredible
the_service_is quick_and excellent
the_owner_is very_polite_and helpful
the_butter paneer_masala and manchurian vegetable are_my two favorites
and_everything i've_had has_been stellar
first impressions can_be_a_little off putting
but_once_you try their_dishes
the_ambiance doesn't seem_to matter
woodlands serves freshly cooked indian_food_at very_affordable prices at_around per each main_dish
my_friends who_are originally from_india recommended this_place_and took_me here while_i_was in_town visiting them to_enjoy some_great south_indian_dishes
there's a_small chutney_bar where you_can get_your favorite chutney just_to snack on or to_dip your favorite bread crepe in thee
too
we_order chole batura
saag_paneer
masala_dosa and chole chaat mango_lassi
they tasted terrific
the_store is_very low key and_the_ambiance isn't_that great
there_are just around tables at_most and you_may end_up sitting in_front_of_the restrooms
but_the_food_is super fresh_and tasted_great
made_from scratch daily and upon your_order
very_good tasty_food
not too_spicy for_my_taste
compare_to little india
a_little_too spicy_for_me
here r what we_ordered
spinach dosai
if u r into spinach
chenna batura
stars for_me
mini masala_dosai
big portion
stars for_me
paneer butter masala
stars
taste_like meat dish but it_is_not
we_will try_other stuff on_the_menu for_our next_visit
possibly the_only vegetarian place i_will eat regularly
i initially wanted_to work through the_entire menu_but started craving items i_enjoyed i_started going_back_to them
lunch_specials are_super filling for_the_price
plates_and stuff are cheap but whatever the_food makes_up_for_it
oh yes and_the chutney_bar is_awesome
and_the pickled hot stuff whatever it_is is_so bomb
i_could_eat a_bowl_of just_that
ok
don't plan_on being impressed_with_the atmosphere
you_will_be served_on paper_plates
however
what_is put_on those paper_plates in divine nectar
this_is_a big step above the_original famous woodlands restaurant_in rishikesh
unrelated
i_asked_the owner in rishikesh
he_is livid about all_the imitations
the_food_here_is amazing
beware
closed tuesdays
drove hours from chino valley one_time to find_that out_the hard way
also
please note that
south_indian
means hot
if_you_want it mild
you_need_to tell them
the_owners_are very_sweet attentive
as_well_as_the mexican waitress
always packed full_of indian customers authentic
the_only indian_restaurant_i found in_az to compare_to this_one_is the govindas in tucson
this_is_a family_run business
the_owners_are the cooks
you_can watch them prepare the_food
best_food
best price
very_clean
i_love_indian_food
this_place_is_great
my couple friends from_india spoke badly of_this_place
however
upon reflection
i_can't think_of a_time where any_indian friends
have_ever given_a favorable review_of any indian_restaurants
i_ate_here and_loved_it
i_got_the dosa with_spinach filling
of_course i doused it_with with tons_of chutneys too
i_loved_it
nice_and_spicy
every_indian i_know always compares it with_their mothers cooking
of_course each indian is_from a_very specific part_of india and_the cooking varies regionally
so_i_guess i_can no_longer listen to my_indian friends regarding indian_restaurant reviews
i_mention this because i_think_it might_be_a cultural phenomenon
which many others might confirm
service_is fast
paneer dosa
idlis and_some curry_which the_owner recommended were_good
ambiance not_that_great and_better for_take_out than dine_in
the_cost is_reasonable but for_some_reason i_felt i_was overcharged on two occasions
the_food_is absolutely_amazing
however
keep in_mind it's south_indian_food
which_means it's on_the spicy side
i_had_the lemon_rice and_also the_dosa with_spinach filling
of_course i doused it_with with tons_of chutneys too
sorry scott b
i plagerized from your review
i_loved_it
nice_and_spicy
i also_got the_cauliflower with chili_sauce
yum
don't_expect ambiance
it's all_about_the cooking
my_indian friend loves it
she raves about_this and drives from n phoenix to_the woodlands about once_a_week
definitely_go and_give it_a_try
good south_indian_food
casual seating but_that's fine when_you don't need fancy place_but want good vegetarian dosas
my_last_visit was_not pleasant though
there_are lots_of flies inside the_restaurant especially on_top_of chatani area
not_very appetizing
this_restaurant was recommended to_be years_ago by_a native indian but_i_didn't get around_to trying_it until now
my bad because the_food_was_awesome
i_hadn't had south_indian_food since actually being_in india_in so this_was_a real treat for_me
i_ordered_the malai_kofta
i'm_a creature of habit
this is_what_i almost always_get
a_side_of iddly and_the paper masala_dosai
the_spice was_just_right
hot enough_to make_me sweat but_not real_indian hot which_is slightly too_much_for me
the dosai was thin_and crispy on_the edges and spongy in_the_middle perfect
my only_complaint_is_that the_malai_kofta was_a_little chewy
slightly overlooked maybe
but the_sauce_was so_delicious that_it hardly matters
they_give_you_a ton_of_food too
i'll probably_be eating delicious leftovers_for two_days
definitely a_place i_would_go to again
oh and_they_had freshly made jelebis that_were so_good
my fianc and_i devoured the_entire package
edited to_add
the_second_time i_ordered malai_kofta the_lentil balls were_perfect and not_at_all chewy
this_is_definitely my_new favorite_indian_restaurant
absolutely_love
love
love woodlands food
feel at_home there
finger licking delicious_food
authentic
yummy
quick
concise and to_the_point
this_is_my new_favorite spot
referring friends here
fantastic_food
one_star off for spork
really
how do_you eat_indian with_a flimsy plastic spork
get real dinnerware and_i_will change report to five_stars
i_work at intel down the_road and me_and_my coworker order from_this_place once_a_week
the_palak_paneer
masala butter paneer
and the_gobi_manchurian are freaking amazing
the_guy at_the_counter which i_believe is the_owner_is always really_nice
and says
hey you're that guy from intel
you still working
we_usually call up the_order and_go pick_it up minutes later
definitely highly_recommend_this_place if_you_like_indian_food
oh
the_food
i_would_say it_is_on par with anandas
it_is spicy
more_of_a kick than seems typical
but i_like_it like_that
where_i start deducting points first is_the overuse of styrofoam and_the very non sustainable serving process
most everything_is served_in styrofoam
even the_drinks
the eating utensils are_very small_and very flimsy plastic
this_is_a deal breaker
i_can forgive the_non friendly demeanor of the_guy behind the_counter
and_the below par ambiance
but considering they're investing very_little in_the experience
the_prices should also reflect this
love_the_food
really tuned off_by everything else
i literally could_not stop_eating
i_ordered_the chenna batura
otherwise
curried garbanzo beans with puffy bread or_even easier
it_was_so satisfying that i_ordered_a second one to_go so_i_could take_it home_and indulge over the_weekend
the_decor_and ambiance was_not_the greatest
but_really
who cares when_the_food is_to_die_for
i_will_be making this my official
place_to_go when_i can_not decided what_i want_to_eat
because i_know_it will_always be satisfying no matter_what type_of food i_am_in the_mood_for
i_ate here_for_the_first_time today with_a_friend who_is a vegetarian_vegan i however am_not so_i_was skeptical
i_ate my words and_my weight in paneer butter masala the_food_was sooooo good
we_also_had_the dosa and_the flat naan like bread
i_don't recall the_name
but_i couldn't stop_eating it_was_all so_delicious
the_chutneys where good_and i_loved_the coconut the_best although spice they_had some_delicious flavors definitely_a new_favorite spot
i_was stuck in_a remote town in the_desert of arizona and desperate for_some real food_so we_found_this indian_restaurant listed about_minutes away_and began the trek
woodlands_is a_vegetarian south_indian restaurant located_in chandler
arizona about_minutes south of phoenix
when_we_arrived
we immediately realized it_wasn't all_i thought it_would_be
located in_a_strip_mall
it_was_a tiny little take_out joint with inside seating for_about
we_took a_look at_the_menu and_were pleased to_see items_that were marked
vegan
so_we_ordered and_took a seat at_a booth
the_restaurant had_a plain interior with cheap tables_and black chairs
towards_the back
there_was_a toppings bar with_lots_of options
we chose_the hot peppers to_add to everything we_had_ordered and_waited for_our_food
we_started_with_the iddly steamed rice_and lentil cakes
these plain
mostly flavorless cakes were_served_with a somewhat runny sauce_that left much to_be_desired
that's not_to_mention that everything_was served_on styrofoam plates
which_i only tend_to see in cities in_the_middle_of nowhereland
so weird
for_our_entrees
we_ordered two curries
i_had_the vegetable_curry that_had green beans and cauliflower in_a coconut tomato based curry
my_friend_ordered the dhall curry
which_had lentils with mustard
cumin
and_spices
neither_of them were anything special
and we_also asked_for super_spicy
but they_weren't spicy_at_all
we also_ordered_the parotta kurma
which turned_out_to be really odd
they_took the_bread and sliced it_up into pieces
then put a_red curry on_it
the_bread_was chewy and slightly spicy
but_just odd
all in_all
it_wasn't worth_the_drive out
the_guy at_the_counter wasn't very_helpful or personable
the_meal_was mediocre at_best
and the_entrees at
each really could_be priced less for_what_we received
oh
and_the styrofoam and paper_plates for_those dining_in the_dining_room were_pretty tacky
well
this_is how_i first felt when_i_got my_food food_on styrofoam plates_and cups
seriously
i_feel guilty to spoil mother earth with so_much plastic shit
the_food_is_not cheap
why cannot they_serve food_on_the proper plates_and cups
i_guess_it was not_a_good day to_go_to woodlands for_us
we_ordered masala_dosa
idli and vada combo
dosa_was only cooked one side and_when_i told the_lady about_it she told_me something ridiculous thinking i_do_not know_how_to make dosa myself
and idlis were_not bad_but vada had_that stale oily smell
you_know_what i_mean right
my_hubby ordered bisibelebath
his all_time fav
which_was not bisi
means hot
at_all
it_was cold
i_am never ever going to_this_place
all_you green lovers out_there
i_highly_recommend avoiding this_place_to avoid seeing so_much plastic plates
cups
spoons
forks
etc
and believe_me the_prices_are comparable to_other_indian_restaurants out_there
its_a bummer that_it_is so bad
me being a_vegetarian
i_will have_one less place to_choose
one_of_my_favorite places for_take_out
the_menu_has lots_of selections and_it's_a vegan paradise
the_food_is consistently outstanding
try_it all
the_vegetable_curry is_my_favorite
this_place just_opened up about a_week ago
and_i_think it's_a_great addition_to_the indian restaurants_in_the_valley
my_husband and_i_went_to eat dinner_here last_night_and
even late on_a monday
it_was crowded
beware it's_a_small space
so_if_you are_going on_a weekend
i_would call for reservations
the_restaurant
located next_to_the india plaza on apache blvd
is_really inviting it's decorated with bright colors
nice
thick tables_and contemporary lights and wall hangings
it_has quite a_different feel than most_indian_restaurants in_the_valley
it_has fun
upbeat music_playing too
although i_think_it could_have been turned down a_little to_make_it easier to_talk
i_loved_the menu
because_it_is quite varied
offering the 'usual' suspects as_well as_some different_items like goan fish_curry
bitter melon curry
goat curries
and gobi_manchurian
and
it_also serves chaat
my_husband_and_i
however
decided_to stick_with the_more typical offerings for the_night
he_got the
la jawab kadahi gosht
which_was lamb pieces and_veggies in_a spicy yogurt_sauce
it_was seasoned really_well and_delicious
i_ordered_the malai_kofta
which_was_also delicious_and seasoned just perfectly
the rice_and_naan we_ordered were_tasty
and_i_loved the_side_of raita instead_of just a_simple yogurt and cucumber dish_that the restaurants_around here typically serve
this raita had_some veggies mixed in_and
i_think
little puffed wheat pieces
yum
all_the_food comes_in copper bowls and plates
too
which i_love
the_service_was quite friendly
albeit a_little_slow
it_took_a while to_get_our food
however
we_felt that_was more to_do_with ironing out_some first week kinks
rather than an indicator of anything more serious
if_you_like_indian_food
i_would_definitely_recommend giving this_place_a_try
went_for_lunch with_a_friend
i_had_the bhatinda lamb special
very_good
the_portion_was modest
but fine for_the avg
appetite in context with the_other stuff
and_the_price included naan
rice
and_a_couple of_other sides
my_friend_ordered a vindaloo dish
which was_a_tad more in price_and was_just_the curry
for_him
the_rice naan_was an add on
it_was_a larger serving
but_i_think he felt a_tad confused due_to_the different offerings included_in my_order
also
he felt it_was_pretty mild
though the_menu_and waiter mentioned it_would_be spicy hot
we mentioned this_to the_manager and_he_said that requesting more heat was_an easy thing for_them to_do
so_if_you like_to sweat when eating vindaloo
and_other indian_fare
just be_sure to_make_it clear when_ordering
in_any case
it_was_a first_visit so_i'm_not sure which are_the_best things to_order and_if ordering a_combination what is_the_best plan
i_would venture to guess
however
that it_would_be a_great_place_to go_with_a small group
then order a_variety_of things and_share
okay
so_i_know you_are wondering
what's with_the stars
fine
that skepticism is warranted so_the answer is_a_very simple
grade inflation
as_in grade inflation for phoenix indian_restaurants
we_all know_the indian_restaurants_are terrible in_phoenix in_general so the_ones that_are pretty_good deserve higher than normal grades
don't_get_me_wrong
my_expectations were exceeded when_i dined at
the
dhaba
guru palace_is still better and_in regards to food
i_would_say royal taj is slightly better but the_dhaba_is a_strong rd place
and_in terms_of the_overall total package
i_would rank the_dhaba the nd best_indian_restaurant in_the_city
the_ambience reminds me_of_the contemporary small joints you_see in_nyc or sf
the_restaurant_is narrow yet not claustrophobic
the style is contemporary with nice mood lighting to_give_it_a comfortable 'lounge
like feel to_it
they_have_the standard flat screen television with bollywood playing
there_are two servers
there_is_a non_indian server_and an_indian server
luckily we_got_the indian server because the_other one just seemed_a_little strange like_the reviewer below said
i_thought the_service_was_pretty good
no
our_waiter didn't exchange pleasantries or talk_to us but_he was efficient
water_was continuously replenished in_our cups which_was a_nice_change for_an_indian_restaurant
a_big hit with_me were_the plates_and cutlery
they_were_all metal including_the cups which provides an_additional authentic feel of dining in_india
the_water especially tastes cooler when_it's served_in_a metal cup
and_just to_avoid confusing people
there_are two parts to dhaba
they_have_a fast_food like chaat place which_is next_door_to its restaurant component
we dined at_the_restaurant
the_food
the_food_was well prepared
the_texture especially was captured right
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was creamy_and not runny
the_quality_of_the chicken included thick chunks_of white chicken_breast
the_saag_paneer had_a_nice smooth pureed consistency but_it_wasn't runny
my_favorite aspect was_the_naan which_had amlost a paratha texture to_it with flaky layers yet it_was baked and crunchy on_the_outside but wasn't burned
the_rice wasn't dry or overcooked like_you receive at most_indian_restaurants
in_terms of_heat
it_was_perfect
it_wasn't_too hot or mild
i though they_really nailed it there
so what was_missing
flavor
the_food didn't lack flavor but it_did lack that addictive quality that_makes you_want to_come_back by yourself and_just chow down when_you just_got finished working out_for hours
oh
don't_get_me_wrong
food_was_tasty and far better_than of_the_indian restaurants_in_the_valley including some vaunted favorites like dehli palace in_tempe
india_palace on th and bell
tandoori_times and maharaj palace to name a_few
the malai_kofta_was arguably the_best in_the_city the_only weak dish_was the_saag_paneer
yes they_got the_texture right but it_was_a_bit plain_and it_could have_used more spice
something_that deserves mention was the_chaat
we_ordered_the samosa_chaat
the_chaat actually contained normal amounts of samosa as opposed_to one small piece_of samosa_and just tons_of sauce
the_samosa and_the chole were very_well prepared and_it_wasn't drowned in sauce
it_was_also fairly big_and it was_more_than_enough to feed two people
other_things worth mentioning
we_had two white guys playing the sitar and tabla
talk_about ironic but the_fact is_they were_really_good sothere was_a live music component
the_place_was also packed and_there_were people waiting outside to enter which i_have_never seen at_an_indian rest
in_the_valley so something is working
finally
the_food_was priced fairly
we_ordered dishes
naan
rice
appetizer_and two soft_drinks for
not_bad for_an_indian_restaurant
the_same would_have cost us about at another_indian_restaurant
this_place_is worth taking a_date to or a_group_of friends as_it's ambience_is hip enough_that if_you_don't_like the_food
your friends won't think_you took them_to some cheap restaurant
in_other words
it's a_good_place_to take people who have_never eaten_indian_food
my recommendation is_that you arrive before
because after that
the_place gets packed
if_you_go before
the_crowd is mostly non indians and_the date crowd
after
you_have large groups of_indian families dining and so_the waiting line can_be extensive and the_tables can_get packed
my_only criticism
if_there is_one
is the_lack_of enough_of waiters and_the length of_time it_took to_bring the_food out
we_ordered our_food at
and_didn't receive it until
and_the_place wasn't busy at_the_time
therefore
i_could imagine that_it could_get much worse if_you_get there past
or pm on_friday and_saturday
i_went_here on_a_friday_night with recommendations from_a few_indian friends
i_was_very disappointed_with_the vegetarian selection
of_the
traditional
indian drink selection
they_were completely out of_all_the drinks
i_asked_for my_curry
hot
really hot_and spicy
it_was_not
we_had a_group_of and half_of our_table had_to_wait_for silverware after their_food arrive
then it_took them about_minutes to bring_us our_check
nor did we get_any water refills
all night
it_was_a bad time all round
before beginning with my_review
i_would_like_to critic
on something_that i_read through a_lot_of reviews_here for
the
dhaba
there_is no f variable spice_level in_indian_food
i_get enraged when people say these things as_if these_are the conventions for_food
most_of_the indian recipes
at least
are prepared with_a predetermined spice_level
how do you_want your_food
mild medium or spicy
is_the dumbest thing_i have_come across in_my entire restaurant life
there_are_some recipes that_are supposed_to be_spicy and_some are supposed_to be medium and_some sweet
reason being indian_spices range way_more than_just chilly for heaven's sake
thai restaurants vary spice_level just by adding more chili
indian_spices are way_more than_just chili and_you_can not add subtract spices like chili_sauce since spices_are added during_the process of cooking and_not on top as garnishing
in_short
mild
medium or spicy
is_like asking what_kind_of a football player do you_want for_your team
fast
faster or fastest
well
quarterback position needs a_fast player
tight ends could_be faster but wide receivers need_to_be the fastest
but_you_can not f switch and play the game
all right
about the_restaurant
my_opinion is that_if_you wish to_have real indian_food
you_have_to go_to cities other_than phoenix
or_even better
go to_india
i_have_been_to some indian_restaurants_in houston
washington dc
new york
san diego
new jersey and a_few_more places and_all places have_much better_indian_restaurants than in_our valley
but_if it_comes_to sticking to_the choices we_have around
i_would rank
the
dhaba as the_most
close_to actual
indian_food_that you_have get
jewel of_the crown ranks probably the_second
but_overall
all indian_restaurants_around here_are good for_some particular things on_the_menu_and worse for others
dhaba comes_to being better_for almost_everything on_the_menu
chicken_tikka_masala
butter_chicken
related dishes are_very_good
all lamb_dishes are_nice and authenticated
vegetarian_options are awfully limited compared_to what it_should_be considering its an_indian_restaurant
common restaurants in_india have at least more vegetarian items on_their_menu
no kidding
but_overall i_am_very pleased with_the range_of quality here at_the_dhaba
garlic naan's are way_too good_to resist
tea
complimentary
is very_close_to what people in_india drink
almost_all non vegetarian_dishes_and paneer_tikka_masala or mixed_vegetables are tasty
somebody wrote about salads and i_would_like_to remind that salads are not_indian because other green vegetables are_very common in regular diets
and yeah
if_you_like_indian music
they_have live music these days on_the_weekends
i_guess
and though i_have_never_been there_for_the music
i bet that_would_be cool
after dining here a_couple_of more_times
i_would_have to_give_this restaurant
stars
the_chicken_tikka_was very_disappointing
it_was_not served on_a sizzling clay plate as it_should_be
the_chicken did_not taste grilled
it_was microwaved and served_on a_plate
the_flavor_was also lacking
honestly
this_is very amateurish and_they simply cannot serve tandoor like_this
also
the_water was_not served chilled with ice
it_was served tapwater temperature and thus your thirst didn't_feel quenched
the_vegetarian sabjis outside_of palak panner and malai_kofta_was average
again
i dined here two more_times after this_and the_quality_of_the_food took_a dip
went_there with_a_friend for chaat
snack
and chai
we_had_the bombay bhel_puri and_the amritsri samosa_chaat
the_samosa dish_was perfectly_cooked and_everything_was nice_and_spicy
i_walked into this_place thinking
oh man
you_know the americans
white dudes
are_going to love_this_place
flat screen tv's
nice tables
friendly_service
trendy ambience
waiters who speak good english
white guy playing sitar at_the_front
this_is white guys paradise
unfortunately the_food_itself was_just above_average
fyi
indians from_india
my_parents
call all white dudes
americans
as_if we_are not americans but_i_thought would throw some humor your way in_case you_were already bored reading the_typical
the_spiciness wasn't there
review
in_terms of_the_menu
i_don't_think dhaba knows how it's trying_to position itself
are they a chaat house
a classic indian_restaurant
a fusion indian_restaurant
and that_is_the problem with_this_place
it's_a smorgasboard
a jack of_all trades yet a master of none
and_that's exactly felt in_the cuisine
the samosa_chaat was_amazing
the_other chaat
bleh
the_chicken_tikka masa was_very_good but_the certainly_not crave worthy meaning it lacked the
hey i'm dying for some_great chicken_tikka_masala
let me order this to_go
quality
it's_really hit_or_miss with their_dishes as_some are completely amateur like their_chicken_tikka
not the_curry but_the grilled version
which tasted like chicken_cooked on_a forman grill_and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served_on a_plate
not_exactly appetizing
their daal was_really_good but_their saag was_okay
and_to wendi below
we don't_eat salads
indian_people created salads for you_guys
so when_you tell_me there_is_a new salad on_the_menu each day
i envision someone at_a chinese restaurant saying we_are offering_a different style_of pizza today
that's_a not a_good_thing
if the_guy is listening to pink floyd
that means the dial is moving even further away on_the authentic meter
what's next
are they going to_start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate
don't_get_me_wrong
dhaba_is one_of_the_few indian_restaurants_in phoenix that_i_will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's_not me being critical
phoenix is a_great_place_for bad indian_restaurants to thirve since_the population is clueless when_it_comes_to indian_food_and you_could seriously serve up_some ground beef with curry_and give_it_a name and they_would think_it's a legitimate and_authentic dish
and_this goes for_the white dudes living_in london who comes on these forums and tells us they_know great_indian_food when they_give places_like india gate stars
but_i digress
okay so if_you_are_not an_indian_food snob and_want_to break out_of your routine of eating_at black angus
this_is a_good_place_to start
if_you_have eaten great_indian_food and are_not easily mesmerized by_a nice_atmosphere go down mcclintock and take_a left on broadway and_try royal taj
this_has been_a staple in_my_life for the_last two_years
i_have_eaten there_on busy nights
on slow afternoons and i_have_ordered taken out
i_don't vary from_what_i order and_i_am always satisfied
i_will agree_with most the_reviews below that_the services has_been very weak in_the_past
everything from uninterested waiters that i_had_to pry recommendations out_of
to pushy waiters that try_to force stuff on_me
i_didn't_want the damn chi tea
i_don't_care if it_came_with the_meal
it_tasted_like crap anyway
while normally i_don't_care much about_how soon they_get my_water filled
when_i_am eating curry that tends_to be pretty_spicy
i_need water
now
after that rant about the_service
i_will_say one last little negative thing
i_order the_meal special
and_with out fail every_time the_desert has changed
i'm_not complaining because_it is_always_good
but can we get_some consistency here
but
sometimes
i_needed dhaba curry
i_need_to so bad
nothing will satisfy until_i have_it
now with so_many good_things going_for it
i_did leave the_dhaba slightly indifferent
you_see when_i order and_eat
i'm_pretty much a_total top
while_i am open to suggestion
i have_a_good idea of_what_i want and how_i want_it
during_my visit
not_only was_i flipped but_i_didn't have_much say in_the matter
please don't_get_me_wrong
our_server_was friendly however
every_time when one_of us_ordered something
he_would tell us_that he_would order_something better for_us_to enjoy
for_me
i_was dead set on ordering several wraps and rolls called sada bahar
what_i ended_up_with was far from_what_i originally envisioned
while_i did get_my way with_a_few appetizers
i_have_to_say not_only was_i pleased with_his domineering ordering selections
but_would eagerly let him order again for_me
street_food called chaat
is_to indian_cooking as dim sum is_to chinese
usually a_small plate with around servings varying in preparation
and_with enough variety to_make_a meal out_of
starting with_the amritsri samosa_chaat
these_are a deep_fried triangular dumpling filled_with a mixture_of potatoes
onions_and chili
served_with_a spicy yogurt_sauce
perfectly crunchy and not_a drop of oil
just breaking into one_of_them was a_delight as_the fragerent steam escaped
it_was aromatherapy indian_style
ambala tiki chaat
was more_of_a composed small plate
a_couple_of potato pancakes
layered with garbanzo beans
onions
and garnished with_fresh mint tamarind_chutney and_yogurt
the_flavor components with indian_cooking are generally very complex
this plate was_a_great example of complexity and harmony
each bite had varying degrees of_spicy and_sweet then_a slightly sour finish from the_chutney
complexity doesn't quite work like with_the kolkata pani puri
these_are round hollows
fried crisp_and served_with_a watery mixture_of tamarind
chili and_potatoes
the_idea is_to spoon in some_of_the mixture into each puri
then pop into your_mouth
while the_texture was_nice
the_flavors just never_came together and ended up just tasting weird
this_is_the part where he_took over_and assured us_what he_was ordering was_going_to_be quite_good
as the_dishes came out we_weren't quite sure_what was what
so_we just dug in
eventually we_got clarity and_just continued to_share
family_style
arriving on_a sizzling iron skillet covered with peppers_and onions
the_chicken_tikka kabob
was_not only_a dramatic presentation coming from_the_kitchen
but_the colors were vivid and bright
large pieces_of boneless skinless chicken_breast are rubbed with_spices then grilled
resulting in_a beautiful yellow color
the_chicken was_tender_and moist yet had a_slight smokiness that added another welcome dimension
served_in_a large basket were piles of_hot freshly baked naan
per order
the thick_and tender bread_was a_welcome site since_i_was wanting a wrap to begin with
plain
garlic_and chili each flavor welcomes dipping
wrapping and scooping of_sauces and meats
loving yogurt
the_creamy tang of_the kashmiri chicken_tikka_masala
was a_welcome surprise
this_is where the_naan really came into play by making good use_of the tender pieces_of_chicken and yogurt_sauce
sopping up as_much of_the delicious sauce as_i could
interactivity is_just part_of_the experience
with_so many_different spices_and spiciness
the_mango_lassi
was_as welcome as_the rain
yogurt and_water mixed_with sugar and_mango was cooling and_refreshing
with_the addition of_a fruit puree on_the_inside of_the glass
made this version different_than others ive tried
though_the effect was_still the_same
at the_end_of_the_meal we_were brought_out_a bowl_of rice_pudding with_a scoop_of pistachio ice_cream
while_the sliced dates and papaya were_pretty to_look_at
none_of_the flavors made much sense together
complaining aside
this did arrive complimentary
who knows
maybe for_being a_good sports
we_were also brought out another off menu item
it_was_a thick
flaky and buttery paratha
similar_to a flour tortilla
this particular version was filled_with pureed cherry and sprinkled with anise seeds
after only_one taste we_were hooked
the_group of_us made short order_of the_warm tender layers
you might_have to_ask_for this_one to_be made special
our_server actually told_us how soldiers in_the hills of afghanistan
would_make these since it_didn't take to_many ingredients or tools
he stared blankly out the_window as_he told_the story
perhaps of_his own personal experience building make shift clay ovens
alright
so sometimes letting go can_be_a hard thing to_do
after this experience
its actually kind of nice sitting back_and enjoying the surprises the_kitchen has in store
i_am by no means an expert_on india cuisine
my_experience is_limited to dozens of buffets_and a_single non buffet experience a_friend took_me to_in manhattan
while that was_good
this_was awe inspiring
the_dhaba is_not_a buffet restaurant
they_serve fresh punjabi food_and have_an extensive_menu
but_not at_lunch during_the week
their innovative approach is_to rotate through the_best items on_their_menu each week
we_ate their on_a_thursday
we skipped the_two vegetarian_entrees and_went straight for_the chicken_and_lamb
both_were melt in_your_mouth outstanding
both_were spiced for flavor
not simply heat
i'm a_huge_fan_of hot_food
but_it_wasn't until driving out_of_the parking_lot that_i realized how not hot the_food had_been
amazing
we_had_the mur lasuni tikka
chicken
and_the kali marichi ka gosht
lamb
served family_style
with fantastic madras lentils
they probably call it something different
yogurt_sauce
taziki
naan_that perfectly complimented the_meal instead_of overpowering it
and a_lovely salad with_a_mango and_lots_of other good_stuff dressing
the_lovely lady there took_the time to_explain everything to_us and_made the_experience that_much better
and since_they rotate the lunch_menu every_day during_the week full menu on_the_weekends and for_dinner i_have good reason to_return at least four more_times this month
ambiance provides the_right feel for_indian_cuisine
including_the copper rimmed tableware that i_like
several lunch_specials that include salad
soup
rice
entree
and_naan_were priced reasonably
service_was pleasant
food_was middle_of_the road
soup size was_a_little small
naan_was dense
thin
and_chewy
not_bad overall
but_could be_better
owner contacted me regarding my_experience and_i_have good assurance it_will_be better next_time
and_i'll certainly return
great to_see proprietors that truly care
a disaster
we_were_told it_would_be an_hour wait
no problem
it_was_a_little over an_hour
but_still
no problem
it's
pm
no waiter until_pm
nothing
nada
then
we_tried to_order_a bottle_of_wine
selection
oh
we're out_of
selection
let me see
no
we're out_of that_one
my_husband gamely tries another selection
they come_back with
we're out_of that as_well
perhaps you_might like_the merlot
the_food arrives
blessedly
quickly
it's mediocre indian
we've lived_in major metropolitan areas and_just weren't impressed
the_menu
at_first glance
is impressive
but the_food_was_just above_average
one last note
the alley shaped space is_a noise box
be_prepared_to yell your thoughts across the_table
so_much for_a_nice night_out
update the_owner offered_us a_dinner in response to_our disappointment
we responded that
rather than_that
that_he ensure that_no future diners experienced what_we experienced
i'll give him another star_for trying_to remedy the situation
you_have_to have_a picky indian to recommend and suggest a_menu for_you to_enjoy this_place
we_had_a good offer for_a menu_that included
pappad chutnies
appetizer samosa pakora
a chicken_dish
malai_kofta
vegetable fritter in_a tomato cream_sauce
daal
naan
rice
ras malai
dessert
and_of_course chai
everything_tasted really_good_and was_more_than_enough to_leave us satisfied
it_is_a_bit small
but cozy
and the_owners were around
so_we_had a_really_good attention
unlike other
indian_places
this_one had much_more flavor
good_thing is around_the_corner from_where i_live
i_probably will_not be back_here_again
and will_not suggest anyone try this_restaurant
i_saw in the_new times'
best_of
review that_it mentioned
this stylish place is_almost always packed_with young indian families
dude
really
that_doesn't indicate that it's_good
it_just means it's_the trendy and hip place_to_go
i_mean
the_decor_is much better_than most_other indian_food places_i've_been
it's fresher and newer
it_has windows
the_food_is meh
paneer_tikka_masala sauce tasted like_a creamy campbell's tomato_soup
malai_kofta_was also super creamy
we_asked_for spicy_food
but we_did_not get spicy_food
the_mint cilantro chutney on_the_table was spicier_than our_entrees
two good_things the_mango_lassi and_the_naan
i'm_not sure_if i_was_expecting too_much and_got caught up in_all_the hype surrounding this_place
but i_have_to_say
meh
i've experienced better
the_taste_of the_food_wasn't anything_that left_me saying
i_must return here
i_can't even remember what_kind_of curry i_ordered
but_it didn't_come with_rice
so there_was_an extra charge
bummer
my_friends ordered dhaba thalis
which is_kind_of a sampler dish
and_i'll give credit to_the_dhaba for loading the_food_on there
perhaps that's the_way_to_go here
the_service_was_also not impressive
it_wasn't_bad
but it_was_just
slow
the_girl who_was our_waitress kept coming_back_to our_table without food to_tell us_the status of_our food_and that_it was_going_to_be delayed
i_suppose that's_a courteous gesture
but at_some_point
i_got to thinking
just come_back when_you have food
though i'm_giving the_dhaba only stars
i_give their mango_lassi_and their decor stars
check_it_out
overall
i found_this_place decent enough
but_i've had_better
the_food_at the_dhaba deserves about or
stars based on food alone
it's not_bad
but it's_also not_that_great
my_husband_and_i got_the item thali plates
so_we tasted of their_curries in total
like_other reviewers noted
the_food_is
meh
the_main problem is_that that the_dishes_are extremely bland
i_love_indian_food to_have rich spices
textures
tastes
this seemed watered_down
the_decor of the_dhaba_is about stars
it's_very nicely_decorated
the_restaurant_is small
but_well laid out
the_service_is about stars as_well
our_waitress_was prompt
and_courteous
the_only difficulty is that_she was_very soft spoken
ie
a low talker
on several occasions
we_asked her_to repeat herself
overall
meh
with nice_decor
for a_student like_me who_is away from home
does not_like to_cook and_has limited money
dhaba is_the_best place_to_eat
their afternoon meals are_just perfect_for students
fits the pocket
fills the stomach and the_food_is_amazing
i_love_their mutton dishes
they_are_very well prepared_and are mouth_watering
hmm my_mouth is already watering
lol
this_is_my_favorite_indian restaurant_in_the_valley
their_curries are very_flavorful_and spicy
i_usually get_their vindaloo
although i've_had the_dhaba curry
and_a_couple others
both lamb_and_chicken
the_naan_is great
and we've been given a_couple desserts on_the house that_were fun and interesting
they_do_a good job of trying_to find_some stuff for_our kids to_eat
but we_usually just bring something along for_them to_have with_basmati_rice
my_wife gets their chiken tikka_masala
and_she loves it
we often go here_for_lunch
which is_not_a buffet
which_we prefer
i_used_to live_in central phoenix and_loved flavors_of_india
since moving_to mesa
i_just hadn't seen or found a_good replacement until i_tried_the dhaba
the_service_was a_little_slow at_times
but_the overall atmosphere was_friendly_and inviting
the_food_came_out hot_and was_flavorful
with_a hint_of spice
and_delicious
both the_plain and_garlic_naan_were crispy on_the_outside but_still soft on_the_inside
the_perfect combination
there_is_also a_small
but decent
selection_of_indian beer
and though the_food_came_out in what appeared_to be somewhat small dishes
we_had enough leftovers to_take_home and_make another_meal
i_was_so pleased with_my evening at_the_dhaba
their food_was_really_good
their ambience was so_much_better than a_lot_of mom_and pops and_the neighboring shops are_just charming
the grocery_store next door had so_many interesting foods and condiments
one_thing that struck me_was that_no matter which box of prepackaged meals i_picked up
the ingredient list was all_of real food and_spices
no ingredients you couldn't pronounce
what_a novel idea
i'm excited to_bring my_indian friend here
she and i_have_eaten_at many indian_places around the_valley and_i_really think she'll love_this_place
for_dinner
i_had_the ambala tiki chaat as_an_appetizer
wonderful
and tikki_masala
as_good as_many i've_had
and lahori malai_kofta which_is_a vegetarian substitute for meatballs
it consists of dumplings made out_of paneer
cottage_cheese
cauliflower florets
carrots and_potatoes in_a rich_and creamy_sauce
i'd never_had it_before
but recommend_it highly
i'll be_back_to the_dhaba again very_soon
let me just start by saying that_i_had stopped going out to_eat_at north_indian restaurants in_the_phoenix_area for_a_while
since i_could_not find one_that satisfied me
having been born and_brought up in_india
i_always compared them_to what_the real thing_is supposed_to taste_like and none met my_liking
i_tried_the dhaba
a_little while ago and_was_very pleasantly surprised_by_the taste and_quality
the_food_was quite authentic_and i_visit there frequently
i_have_tried quite a_few_things on_the_menu_and the_chicken_and mutton selections are_very_good
but_the winner is
insert drum roll here
the maa ki daal
black daal
it truly reminded me_of home
the_phoenix_area has quite a_few indian_restaurants but none that_i_would re visit
now_i have finally found one_that has_good punjabi food
btw
the_chaat cafe next door is_pretty_good too
when_i don't_feel like a_regular meal and_am craving_some good
street
food
this_is_my choice
hope this_place stays around
so_i_can have a_place_to satisfy my_indian_food cravings
this_was another groupon find of_mine
although i_had_heard about_it
in_a not so_good light
from_a_friend
however
i do_love me some_indian_food
so_i grabbed my_partner and headed over there
the_groupon was_for
and_at most_places
if get get apps
food
dessert_and iced_tea
we hit that mark
not_here
we each order_the fanciest thali they_had
comes_with salad
naan
biranyi rice
desser
chai
mini mango_lassis
dal and_two veggie_dishes
but_they_were only a_piece
so_we wound up ordering two more starters
the_potato pancake chaat and fried paneer
in_order to_hit our price point
and_then we_took a_lot_of_food home
the mango_lassis were_delicious
as_was_the salad
i_wasn't such a_fan_of the_chaat it_was_a_little too_spicy and a_little_too mushy
i_loved_the fried paneer
but who doesn't love fried_cheese
it_was_great with the_tamarind_chutney
as far_as the_main meal
i_loved everything
though next_time
will_go with plain basmati_rice
i_especially enjoyed_the paneer_tikka_masala and the_malai_kofta
my_favorite_dish ever
the_dal was_good i've never seen kidney beans in_it before
but i_liked_it
the_only_thing_i didn't absolutely_love was the_saag_paneer the_texture was_too smooth
however
my_partner scarfed it_down
for_dessert
i_was_expecting rice_pudding
or the_sweet balls
instead
our awesome server asked if we'd tried carrot fudge
we_hadn't
so she_brought that out
i_liked_it
except_for_the sultana raisins
i_hate raisins
it_didn't hit_the_spot for my_partner though
and the_chai wasn't_as strongly spiced as_i like
plus i_prefer honey to sugar packets as far_as sweetening it
we'll be_back
for_sure
i_might go_with_a small thali
but_it's_a really good_deal
and an_excellent amount of_good food_for_the value
glad i_found_it
i_have_been_to this_place only once which_was like years back
one_thing that stick'd out_for me_was_the colorful interior with_the theme of_indian flag
we_were a_group_of and_we_had a_good_time in_their just having fun and enjoying the_food
they_served in copper plates_and copper tumblers
the_food_was_excellent we pretty much ordered the_whole vegetarian_menu n like_a chicken_dish
the_taste reminded of_food back_home
they_even had a_big screen tv playing indian music_videos
some_of musics were_the once_we grew up_with
brought back memories
me n my_friends still talk_about the_food_in dhaba n the_experience we_had in_there
a memorable time_to cherish and_maybe go visit_this_place one_day
i_went_to_this restaurant_with my_wife_and ordered roghan gosh and chicken_makhani
the_food_was_delicious
we complimented this meal_with onion_and special naan
which_was an_excellent choice
no_complaints about_the_food at_all
my_wife ordered mango_lassi which she thoroughly_enjoyed
we_have_been to_other_indian_restaurants in_the southeast valley and_we definitely rate as one_of_our favorites
amazing_food
beautiful decor
a_bit expensive
otherwise a_star place
its_not the_most_authentic food_but it_was_good nevertheless
i_think_i heard too_much hype
it_just wasn't good
very_bland biryani with_little or no meat
subpar service
and slow food delivery
i_prefer priya
though the_service_is not_good either
their_dishes are_delicious
by_far_the_best_indian food_i've_had since moving_to arizona
the_chicken_tikka_masala_and vegetable_korma are my_go_to favorites every_time
the only_negative about the_dhaba_is that it_can_be somewhat slow in the_service department
it actually adds a_bit to_the mellow feel of the_atmosphere there
but if_you're_in a rush
it's probably_not a_good_choice
the_food_is_always worth_the_wait
since_i haven't eaten a_lot_of_indian food i_opted_for_the maharaja patiala tandoori thali which_included tandoori_chicken
tandoori tikka
lamb_curry
lentils
biryani
rice
house salad
raita
chutney
papad
chai and_dessert
the_lamb_was the_highlight_of the_meal
the_sauce it_was_in was_delicious
for_me it_was the_right_amount_of spice without being too_hot
the naan_was_also full_of_flavor either alone or dipped in_the remaining lamb sauce or raita
unfortunately the_chicken_was too_dry so_i didn't_eat much_of it
the_rest_of_the included food_was_good but_not exceptional
i_would_go here_again but next_time_i_will stick_to lamb and_naan
the_food_is_great but_its a_little_pricey for_a poor college student like_me
the_food_is_really awesome though so_i suppose it's_worth_it
it's_also a_great_place_for a_nice_little romantic date
out of_all_the indian_restaurants_i've_been_to in_the_valley this_one has the_nicest atmosphere
i_especially like_to browse the little_indian market next door when i've finished_eating
we_went here_for_the_first_time because_of_the groupon offer
i_cannot believe_that in_the four years i've worked at nearby asu that i_haven't_been here_before
the_space and_service_is warm_and inviting
but_it's the_food that_will have us coming back
fresh
delicious
you_can tell that_they toast and grind their own spices
my_daughter always orders chicken_pakora
which_i usually find very blah
but_at dhaba it_was fabulous moist
tender white_meat fried perfectly in_a light crispy batter with just_the_right_amount_of spice
and_the paneer_pakora was even_better
from_the appetizers
try_the bhatura chole
onward
our_meal was_the_best we've_had in_any indian_restaurant_in_the se valley so_far
oh
and_it's_a plus that_they_have white wines by_the glass that compliment the_food
this_place used_to_be chaat corner its recieved some massive plastic surgery
nice_ambiance
not any way like an_authentic_indian dhaba
but_the_food inside makes_up_for_it
the_lamb_curry was thick
spicy
and_rich in potatoes
it_made my_stomach happy
stay away_from_the goat_curry
that curry singlehandedly took away a_star
it_was flavorful enough
but_it_was thin and_the_quality_of_the meat_was questionable
the thalis won't disappoint they're reminescent of thalis from north_indian dhabas
the_desserts are authentic
and they_usually bring_you out free fresh hot tea
we_went_in a_big group_and our_waiter_was pretty darn_good
food_was very_tasty_and portions_were great if you_were hungry
the_menu_was extremely long and involved
accommodated our_group of_people wonderfully
restaurant_is fairly small
staff_were attentive_and polite
i_would_go again
the_place used_to_be good
but_not any more
they_have settled for mediocre taste customer_service like any_other_indian_restaurant in_the_valley
don't_expect a miracle
but_if_you_are hungry and_want_to grab some spice after_a sun devils game
then not_a_bad choice
better_than other_indian shops in_that area
the a_curry a_day lunch combos was paltry and_plain bland
dal was flavorless and_the_rice_was tough
so_i effectively paid for_a_few mouthfuls of chicken_curry
which_was decent
and_two pieces_of naan
i'd rather go_to_a place_like little india where they_charge half as_much without_the fancy decor
the_paneer entree dishes though are_just fabulous
if two people are_going i'd say forget about variety_and just order paneer
after searching_for decent_indian_food in_the_phoenix_area i_was introduced to_the_dhaba a_few_years ago_and it restored my faith that_good indian_cuisine could actually be_prepared in_the_valley
i stick_to the_vegetarian_dishes and have_yet_to be_disappointed
the_staff_is always friendly
the_restaurant clean_and the_music fun
once in_a_while there will_be videos playing on_the flat screen above the_bar
but normally just some_good music
i_will update this_review after eating_there this weekend
i_went_here last_night to_use my_new living_social deal
the_decor_is really_great down_to an awesome_place setting
copper cup and copper silverware
i_called ahead_and made_a resey for a_tuesday night_and when_we_arrived there_was_a reserved sign on the_front table
really nice_touch we_got_the best table in_the house
the_food_was_really_good
we_ordered_the vegdy appetizer platter
veggy meatball dish
skip this
garlic_nan
and_butter_chicken
everything_was_delicious and not_at_all spicy
i_think_the usual indian_buffets make things really_spicy so you_eat less
here i_couldn't eat anymore b c i_was stuffed
i_would_be remiss if_i didn't give a_special kudo to_the man who brought out our_food and filled our_drinks
best guy ever
we_started eating_here last year we_were very_impressed_with the_service the_food
since then
i_feel_like the_service_is somewhat lack luster
refusing to allow coupons to_be used on_the take_out orders and insisting they_have_a credit_card number when_you phone something in
we_used to_be_able_to order special requests
but_not now
the_flavors_of the_food are_good
but_the portion_size in relation to the_price_is small
the_chicken is_usually over done not_the_best cuts of_meat
but because_the sauces_are so vibrant
it's_easy_to hide from some
rice naan_are separate
which_is disappointing
the_atmosphere_is_nice not tacky like many other_indian_restaurants
very_good_food
some_of_the best_and most_authentic i_have_ever_had
my_only_complaint_is the_service
it_is_always slow_and server never is_really busy
the_place_is small_and i_have_never seen more_than tables full inside
however
it_takes forever_to order
get_a refill
or get the_check
hire a_better server and_this_place might get a_star from_me
i_have_been_here to_eat several_times
and_the_service_is bad every_time
i keep_coming because the_food_is_so delic
let me start by saying i_think dhaba_is actually a
star
the_food_was_good
but_not fantastic
the_service_was_good but_not superb
the pricing was reasonable
but_not a_steal
overall a_pleasant experience
but_not likely one i_will repeat on my_own accord
in dhaba's defense
they have_a_lot_of competition when_it_comes_to small indian_food places in_the_valley
so_i_can't give_it_a compared_to some_of_the excellence i've experienced at its competitors
my_bf and_i both tried the_sampler platters
meat_and vegetarian
the_salad we_started off_with was_excellent
the dressing was_fantastic_and they_had these crunchy balls on top
almost_like a cereal
the_entrees_were just_okay
my masala was_very_good
but_everything else i_could_have done without
also there_was no_spice whatsoever in_any of_the_dishes
very_disappointing
the pricing was reasonable
i_was_surprised some_of_the reviews mentioned it_was expensive
i_think dhaba_is probably a_great_place_to start if_you_don't typically eat ethnic foods with_a_lot_of flavor or spice
we_both left feeling satisfied
but like the_meal_was missing something
a precious
authentic
little wonder
went_with my_family from out_of_town and_was worried my_dad would_be disappointed_with_the relatively conservative portion_sizes
however when_you treat your taste_buds with something so exquisite
you don't_want_to overwhelm them with massive platters of ambrosia
and_even though when_they delivered the_small bowls_of tear jerkingly delectable curry we wondered if we_would need_to order more we_actually had_enough to_take_home
plus
when filling up_the takeout boxes
we_found ourselves shamelessly scraping the_bottom of_each and_every quaint little bowl
why only stars
i_haven't_tried everything_and look_forward_to updating this with another happy stomach and an_additional star
prices may be seen as somewhat steep for the_quantity of_food
but again i_say
quality my_friends
quality
saturday_night
no reservations
place was_busy
but_they sat us immediatly
we frequent several indian restarant in_the_valley and_have traveled in_india fairly extensivly
the_food_was beautiful
nicely prepared
absolutely delish
first rate
service_was outstanding
there is_a_little grocery_store next door_and we stocked up_on some_of our_favorite foods while there
they_had some_of_the indian pastries that i_love but rarely can_find
the_owner of_the grocery_store and_the restarant was manning the_cash_register
he_was extremly kind and_helpful
go_there
you won't_be_disappointed
the_dhaba is_a_little far_from us
but since_we_were in_tempe we_stopped_in and_were glad_we did
i_loved_the saag_paneer it_had just_the_right_amount_of kick and the_cheese was spongy and_not hard
the_naan_was_good
as_was_the rice
and_my_husband liked his lamb_vindaloo
the_chai was_also_very_good
and_made even_better by_the free refills
we_didn't have_any problems with service at_all
to_the contrary
even though there_were only_two staff members there
everyone_was polite_and attentive
why just three stars
you_ask
i knocked it two points for_the portion_size relative to the_price
i'm willing to_pay more_for quality_food
sure
but it'd be nice if_there_was at least more of_it
the_food_was_very_good
but_i_think other_indian_restaurants have comparable quality_food for_more reasonable_prices
the_store next door is a_lot_of fun_to browse
and_if you're out to_get fed for cheap
try_their web site or restaurant
com before you_go both usually_have coupons
this_place_is consistently good
the_lamb_korma is_excellent
creamy with pine nuts you_can actually taste and_the_lamb is_not fatty
tandoori dishes always smell amazing
i_keep meaning to try_them
but get distracted by_the curries because_they_are so_good
the_naan_is ok
i_always_get paratha because i_like_it better
the_service_is a_little_slow
but_the_food_is worth_it
also
they_have street treats on_the_menu_that always make_me want_to drool
but_they_are never available when_we are there
a_perfect little_gem
food_was_amazing
service_was_great_and did_i_mention the_food
we_started_with_the paneer pakore with curried chickpeas and oh_my god
so_good and_not_too filling
i_ordered_the spicy butter_chicken_and my_date ordered_the curried chicken
we_were_both in heaven
i_can't_wait_to_go_back
a guy at work told_me about_this_place so_i_decided_to phone in an_order from_my car after work i tmust say it_took_me times to_get somebody on the_line
i_think_they may own the_store next door_and thats who_was answering the_phone in_a heavy indian accent after_my rd attempt i_finally got_a employ family member im guessing the daughter who spoke clear english i_told her ihad not_been there_before and_did_not have_a menu_but between my semi knowledg te of_indian_food and_a_few sugestions from her i_got some_great dishes spinich dish w chicken a_spicy curry lamb_dish and_a_great vegi dish rice_and_naan yummmmy
the_best word to sum up my_experience would_be
impressed
upon walking_in
the_decor_is beautiful
i_love_the authentic looking place settings
and_the lighting just gave an all_around warm feel to_this small space
and even_though_the restaurant_is_very small i_didn't_feel like they_had the_tables packed in_there
so we_were_all sitting on_top_of one another or stuck listening to anyone's conversation
our_server was_very_nice_and informative
and was_really helpful when selecting the_perfect variety_of_dishes
when_our food_arrived it_was amazingly flavorful_and portion_size was_more_than_enough for leftovers
which_were just_as delicious the_next_day
i_had chicken_biryani here
what they_served was not_even close
din't look or taste_like biryani
it_was_more like pulao sambar rice
another rice based indian_dish
but they_do_have very_delicious entrees
go_for_the entrees
no biryani please
i_really_liked the_food_here
i_would_be kidding myself if_i wrote that i_remembered what_i ordered
but_it_was vegan
the_menu_is enormous and_it_took us about minutes_to_get through it
however
the_staff never rushed us
in_fact
they_offered assistance in deciphering what_we might best be suited for
and you_know_what else_is great
they_actually play indian_music in_the_background
and_have an_indian hostess
for_entrees
a_mango_lassi
an_app
a garlic_naan
bucks
with a_coupon
bucks
had_plenty_of leftovers_for another_meal
check_out_the store next door
it_has those microwave indian stews that_you add rice
these packets are so_delicious and_quick
i_had bought a_restaurant
com gift cert for_this_place so_we_decided to_try_it_out friday_night
it's_a_small eatery in_an_indian
plaza
once seated i immediately noticed_the pewter style dish_and water cup on_the_table
not_the norm so it_was_a_nice
unique touch
we_ordered_a vegetarian style appetizer platter with fried_cheese
potato filled dumplings
and_other veggie delights
it_was_amazing
my man ordered the_vegetable dumpling stew and_i_ordered_the kidney beans
we_got an_order_of basmati_rice_and garlic_naan to_go_with it
with_all of_this and_the crispy thing you_get in the_beginning
i'm_not sure_what it's called
we_were stuffed_and had_leftovers for_lunch_the_next_day
our water_glasses_were repeatedly refilled
which is_always_a plus for_me
the_menu_is huge but broken down into veggie_options
chicken
lamb
etc
i've_been_to other_indian_restaurants where the_food_was equally good
but_i enjoy_the different touches such_as the dinnerware
not_to_mention the attentive_service
we'll be_back
i_recommend_the chicken_tikka_masala
it_has_a small quaint atmosphere
this_is your basic nice indian_food spot
great butter_chicken
as i_am writing this_for whatever reason the punjab pimp daler mehndi is thumping in my_head
tunook
tunook mmm da da da
i_first want to_mention_the extreme politeness i_get whenever_i call to_place a_take_out order
they
unlike other indian_cuisine restaurants want my business
yours too
and_it shows
the_menu_is very broad which i_love
they_have full vegan entrees
although i_am_not close_to being vegan i do_love alot_of vegetable_dishes and dhaba has many
the_vegetable
meatballs
are outstanding
i_have_never_had a_bad_meal hear although some of_my_favorite go_to foods i can_find better eleswhere
so everytime_i do eat_here i_get something new
my_go_to items by the_way are mushroom matar
palak_paneer and_a protein i
e
lamb
goat or_chicken
the_dishes here always are fresh
fragrant
plentiful
bright_and overall spiced very_nice
i_prefer very_hot food_in temperature and_they nail it
i_prefer my_food extremely hot in spice too which_they tend_to be mellow on for my_taste_buds
please
sir chef
go_on and hurt me with_the magical indian_spices
it's ok
if_i order_a ten it_should_be blazing
with all_this said dhaba_is unique in it's offerings
clean in presentation and_overall a_pretty_good indian_joint
i_will continue to_eat_there
if_you_are an employee of any_indian_restaurant in_arizona here me now
you_are from_the continent asia
take_a cue from your counterparts and_give rice_with dishes for_free
just plain white_rice
i_do get irked that_this cuisine charges for_this plain starch
i_went_here last_night with a_party_of
the place_was_pretty busy for pm_on_a wednesday night so luckily i_made a_reservation and we_were_seated promptly
the_service_was_very friendly_and_helpful but pretty unattentive
this_was probably because there_were way_to many tables_with way_too many_people and not_enough waiters waitresses servers
there were_only people plus the_cook
s
doing everything and_they_were clearly overwhelmed
the_other thing i_didn't_like was the_menu
it_had far too_many choices
there_were probably dishes_on_the thing
so_we basically gave up and_everyone ordered a_different kind of dish so_we_could all share
we_ended_up getting_a chicken_dish
a shrimp_dish
a_vegetarian dish
and some_sort_of meat sampler thing
we also_ordered an_appetizer sampler thing
some_rice and some_naan
everything was_very_good_and full_of unique flavors
i've never_been_to india_and have_only eaten_indian_food other times
but_i_thought the_food_here was_very_good
the_only_problem with it_was_the price
it_was ridiculously priced_for what_you_get
the_actual portion_size is_actually pretty_good
but charging for shrimp or pieces_of lamb_is ridiculous
it_is even_more ridiculous because nothing comes_with sides
everything_is a_la_carte
my_wife got some_kind_of meat sampler
which_came out a_full minutes_before the_rest_of our_meals
and_it_was laughable that_it_was
anyway
this_place pretty much robs you
luckily we_had_a certificate from local dines http
bit
ly dfr eq which lessened the blow a_bit but_i_was still pissed
so
if you_must go
get_the certificate and_you'll be glad you did
this_is_the_best eastern indian_food_i_have_had since_moving from_the dc area
i_have_eaten_at way better_indian_restaurants out_here
the_malai koftas were rock hard
and the_biryani was_nothing more_than pulav
someone please tell them the_difference
just_not worth_it
been twice to_this_place
the_food_is out_of_this_world
we_went yesterday and_had_the goat
which_was the_best_thing we_ate the_first_time
the_chicken with_spinach
upon recommendation of the_waitress
the_garlic_naan_and pistachio
cashew almond naan
and_the chickpeas
i'm sorry for_not remembering the_indian names_of any plates
take_your pick as_to which tasted best
this_is delicious_food
if_you_like_indian
i_don't_think you_can find food better_than this
and_if_you do
let me know_where to_go get_it
it's average_indian
not_bad
flavor was_ok for the_tikka_masala_and the_goat_curry
naan_was very_disappointing more_like pita_bread than naan
i_would_give the_food stars
however
for what_you_get
it's pricey
so_i knocked off one_star
i_would_not be_going back_there because_i can't justify the price_for what_i get_in return
i_enjoy indian_food
but_this_place had the_worst service
we_had_a table_of and some_people got their_food in_minutes
some_people got their_food in an_hour
what a_horrible experience
the_owner sent me_a message and_wanted_to see if_there_was anything he can do
glad_to hear from him
also
this_review was from quite some_time ago
i updated with stars_because the_owner really seems_to care about_this_place
thanks
my_first_experience at_the_dhaba was_excellent
the_food_is rich_and flavorful
and the_vindaloo packs quite_a punch
the_staff_is_friendly_and took great care_of us
we'll definitely_be returning
i wrote a_review for_this last_week
but_just realized that i_should_have posted it_here
rather than under
indian plaza
i_have_been_here three_times
and_each_time i_wonder how_i have lasted so_long without this_food
just last_week i_had_a lunch_special
a_very_good deal
that_came_with a_drink
mango lettuce salad
the_best freshly baked naan_bread i've ever_had
mint yogurt_sauce
rice
lentils
and my_main entree of_vegetarian dumplings in_a creamy tomato sauce
delicious
i_was completely full
but i_didn't_feel gross like_some american restaurants leave me feeling
i_still had room_for some hot chai_tea made_from scratch
it_was_perfect just as_it_was
without any sweetener
the_first_time_i went our_server_was nice but_not so attentive
this last_week the_service_was_excellent
i never_had an_empty glass
and our_food_was quick to_arrive
the_ambience_is intimate a_great_place_to go_on a_date or catch up_with an_old friend
this_is_a true tempe treasure
love_this_place
and_i'm here_on valentine's day with_the people i_love
coincidence
no
you_can thank groupon_and the_fact_that we_didn't get_a baby sitter
and
did_i_mention
my_wife also loves this_place
what about grandma you_ask
does she love_this_place
who knows
she's coming anyway
the_menu now indicates such things as gluten_free
vegetarian
and_vegan for each_item
that's good because_i avoid those categories like cooked carrots and_water chestnuts
orders are_served on_an arrangement of copper bowls
the_chicken_vindaloo is_actually a_little_spicy
seating is_limited
so a_reservation is recommended
i'll see you at_the_dhaba
i_just feel cool saying the_name
to myself as_i finish typing this_review
i_feel badly about giving_this small family_run
i_would guess
business only stars considering the_service_was_excellent and_the_food_was cooked_to_perfection
but_i_just don't_like this non fat style_of indian_cooking which seems_to be popular in_phoenix
give_me the_butter and creams they_usually cook with and_i'm much happier
that_said
this_place looks kinda dumpy from the_outside
but inside it_is pleasantly
well
pleasant
clean_and cute and homey
if_you_are_a spicy indian_food fan
which i_am_not cause i_don't_like it when_my lips burn
this_place_is for_you
they_did serve a_mango rice_pudding that_was so beautifully presented i_almost felt guilty eating_it
almost
course
that didn't stop me_from slurping it down_to the_bottom of_the_dish
yeah
it_was_good
reasonable_prices for_sure
great_service
good_food
it_was_just not_my style is_all
my_brother and_i_decided_to get_some take_out_and thought this_would_be a_great_place_to try
we_shared curry_chicken
the lakhnavi shahi_paneer
an_order of_rice_and order of_garlic_naan
everything_was_very fresh_and_tasty
however
the lakhnavi shahi_paneer really stood out
it_was probably_the_best indian_dish i've ever_tasted
i'm already itching to_go_back_and_try more_dishes on_the_menu
also love that_they stay open til
the_dhaba was a_real treat
i_went on_a_weekday evening about
pm_and was_surprised how_busy it_was
first good_sign
the_two of_us_were immediately seated_and served chilled water in the_most interesting copper goblets
a selction of_chutney and papadum came right away as_well
the_hostess was_also our_server
she took_our beverage order while_we began a strategy of what_to_order
the_menu_was very extensive and contained many_items i_had never_heard_of before
despite_the wide array_of choices we stayed pretty basic
choosing a paneer_masala
chicken_tikka
a savory chick_pea dish and_of_course basmati_rice_and naan
the_meal came quickly_and was_the freshest i_think i_have_ever_had
every_bite was phenomenal
from the_service to_the dishes_and everything_in between made this experience truly memorable
i_cannot_wait to_go_back
the_only_thing_i would change now_i am being hyper critical
would_be_the lighting
it_was_very bright for_an evening meal
i_guess_it made_me appreciate_the appearance of_the_food easier
i loved_this_place
cute decor
nice staff great_food
will_be_back_for sure
first_time using dining local and_it_was_a win
the_food_is_excellent
but grossly overpriced_for what_you_get if_you_don't go_for one_of_the weekday lunch_specials
friendly_service
interesting decor
plus it's fun to_check_out_the other shops the_dhaba shares its building with
best indian_food_in_the_valley as_far as_i'm concerned
the_service_has always_been beyond terrific and the_food_is_awesome
i_really can't say anything bad about the_dhaba
well
once the_rice_was overcooked
but it_was_just once
it's_also a_great_place_for families
they_always treat our daughter like_a grandkid when we're there
last_night was_my_first_time at_the_dhaba and i_will_definitely_be_back
we_had_a reservation for_at
on_a wednesday night_and were_not seated until after pm
this_is_my only_complaint about the_restaurant after eating_there
it_was_definitely worth_the_wait
we_ordered tandoori_chicken
chicken_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
and rice_and_naan
of_course
the_portions look small
and we_did_not take_home any leftovers
but_we_were full to_the_point of bursting when_we_left
we_also_had_a bottle_of_wine
and_i intended to_try_the chai masala but_i will_have_to save it_for next_time
the_meal itself_was by_far_the_best_indian food_i_have_ever_had
i_tend_to gravitate more towards masalas and vindaloos for the_most_part
and theirs were_excellent
but_i_was absolutely blown_away by the_korma
nutty
creamy
sweet
spicy perfect
i scraped the bowl and my_plate clean with_naan
and_will go_back_for this_dish alone over_and over_and over again
the_service_was_friendly
helpful while ordering
and unobtrusive throughout the_rest_of_the meal
which_i like
my_water stayed full and_that_was all_i needed
having to_wait after making a_reservation was initially somewhat off putting
but_this minor annoyance was forgiven the_moment we_tried_the food
maybe next_time we_will make_a_reservation slightly earlier than_we want_to_eat
i_am pretty new_to_indian cuisine
i_have_only had_it a_few_times at parties
or events at work
i have_liked most_of what i_have_tried
a_few_months ago groupon offered_a deal_for the_dhaba
and based on a_recommendation from_a_friend i_decided_to take advantage_of the offer
guess what
i totally forgot until a_day or_two before_the offer ran out
so
i quickly got a_group together and_made reservations for thursday night which_was the_final night of_the offer
when_we_arrived it_was apparent that i_was_not the_only doofus that waited until_the last_night
the_restaurant_was packed
and people_were outside waiting
the_hostess was_actually turning people without reservation away
i_was_so glad that_i_had made a_reservation
because we_were_seated within minutes of arriving
the downside was_that we_waited over minutes_for a_server to_come to_our_table
my group decided_to order three appetizers_and three main_dishes
appetizers
paneer_pakora
punjabi murgh
chicken
pakora
punjabi vegetable platter featuring veggie_and paneer_pakora
the winner
the punjabi vegetable platter
we laughed saying they tasted like bloomin' onions only different
the_chicken was_also_very_good
but_the paneer_pakora was_a_bit bland
main entrees
dhaba chicken_korma
dhaba lamb_curry
achari lamb
the winner
dhaba chicken_korma
it_was_so creamy and_had_a rich nutty flavor
i_felt bad
i_really didn't_want_to share
both of_the lamb_dishes were_good
but_i_found them to_be excessively salty
the achari lamb_was way_to spicy for_my_taste
the service_was_ok given that_they_were understaffed and_extremely busy
but_i_will let this slide since_i waited until_the last_night to_use the_groupon deal
i_will tell you
i_am_a dhaba fan
and i_will_definitely_go back
bought the_deal chicken for_our trip_to az from so cal
the_food had_plenty_of flavor_and was_delicious
ordered_a_chicken
lamb
fish_and rice dish_and wasn't disappointed
the spice_level_of had_plenty_of kick
the_service_was_very_good
i_would_definitely come_back_to the_dhaba when visiting az again
updating with an_extra star_because we_went_back today with a_reservation at and_were sat immediately
the_food_was heaven and_the korma_was maybe even better_than last time
dhaba_is amazing
the_chicken_tikka is delish
i've gone times with an_indian friend_who also says it's some_of_the best she's had in_the_valley
the_place_is charming and food_is_great
they_offer a_lot_of deals on different sites
restaurant
com groupon like sites
so look_for them
yum_yum
this_is_an update to_a star_review i_gave a looooong time ago
i_know i_said i_wouldn't come_back
but_i lied
you_just have_to realize that sometimes mommy lies
i_had two complaints last time
one_was that the_food_was_not spicy when_we_asked for_spicy
and_two was_that_the entrees we_ordered were_too creamy
both_of these_were completely different when_we_went this time_around
paneer_tikka_masala was right_on
we_ordered_it at_a heat_level of out_of
and_it_was just_the_right_amount_of heat
the_pakoras are_great
and the_mango_lassi still kicks arse
i_would_like_to mention_that the_last_time_i was_there and_gave the star_review
someone from the_restaurant contacted me_and invited me_to try_it_again as_a guest of_the_restaurant
i_did_not take him up_on it
but_that_was true class and excellent_service
the_servers this afternoon were_both attentive_and_friendly
i take this as a_sign that_they_are truly interested in being_a great_restaurant
a combination_of the_atmosphere
much_more open
clean
and_full_of natural light than_other indian_food places
and improvement to_the_food since the_last_time_i visited makes this_place one_of_my top three indian_food places in_the_valley
word
the_dhaba_is definitely_one_of_the best_indian_food restaurants_in_the_valley by far
the_other one we_like is_the dheli palace for_their_lunch_buffet
we_usually try a_lunch_buffet first before deciding whether to invest in dinner cause indian_cuisine_is very pricey
due to_all_the rave reviews we_decided_to go_for_it and_have become fans ever_since
we_are always surprised when the_place_is not_so busy because the_food_is_excellent
i_think the_fact_that they_do_not have_a_buffet has something to_do_with this
for_most who_are not_familiar_with the_cuisine of_india
ordering can_be_a daunting task which_is why buffets really work with_indian_food
i_am of_indian decent
st generation
so_i_know my_way around the_dishes and_have been_able_to guide both friends_and family through_the rich assortment_of indian_dishes
but_if_you don't_have_a guide it can_be_a_little scary
just saying
a_buffet might be the_way_to_go to_give business a boost
we_love the_dhaba
give it_a_shot you_will_not_be_disappointed
the_food_is_great but_its a_little_pricey for_a poor college student like_me
the_food_is_really awesome though so_i suppose it's_worth_it
it's_also a_great_place_for a_nice_little romantic date
out of_all_the indian_restaurants_i've_been_to in_the_valley this_one has the_nicest atmosphere
i_especially like_to browse the little_indian market next door when i've finished_eating
let me first thank yelp deals for brining this into my_life
let me then thank the abundance of yelp employees i_know who brought yelp deals into my_life and thus brought the_dhaba into my_life
the_dhaba
just_like every item on_your menu
i have_no_idea what_you mean
i_can_only assume it translates into
super delicious
super freaken delicious
slice of god
or purely
pure exctacy
i_don't eat_indian_food that often
i'm not_sure why
but maybe its because_i'm a moron
after dining at_the_dhaba
i not_only want_to make indian_food a part_of my_life
i_think_i now want_to marry an_indian woman
who will cook indian_food_for me for_the_rest_of my days on_this plante
i_will take_care of_everything else in_our lives as_long as_you make_me the_standard seven meals a_day
i_can't think_of anything bad to_say about_this_place
top_of_the line food
great_service
great decor
and did_i_mention how_much i like_the_food
i_guess the_one downfall is_that_it_is in_tempe
which_means you_have_a greater chance of running into asu types
besides the repulsion of dining_with asu things
this_is_a tasty restaurant_that i_recommend to_anyone_who is_not stunted with_the stupid genes
before today i_had only_one experience with_indian_food
it_came in_the form_of an eating challenge in new york city
it_was fun but_not very_tasty_and left_me with_a flaming mouth and weak bowels
a_friend wanted_to try_and indian_place_in her neck of_the woods
i checked yelp_and saw_that the_reviews for_this_place were bad so_i mentioned the_dhaba
the_reviews were_good
i_always wanted to_try_it and it's_right across_the_street from_my place
very_happy we dropped by
the_restaurant_was on_the small side but had_enough tables to_accommodate anyone that dropped by
the_decor was_nice_and i_especially liked_the metal water_glasses
very cool
i_ordered garlic_naan_and a_lamb curry_dish
the_naan_was fantastic and_the_lamb_was great
the_naan provided a_great_way_to scoop up_the excess curry
for_my beverage i selected a_tasty indian_beer
my_friend_ordered a_veggie sandwich stuffed with_potatoes that_she really_enjoyed
she also_ordered little bits_of chicken tenders
these were_fantastic
the breading was_good_and_the chicken had_a_little kick
if you check_in you_will_get a_free desert
however i_was_not offered a_choice
it_was mandatory rice_pudding
it's_not what_i wanted but since_it_was free i_made no complaint
i_could take or leave the_rice_pudding
service_was_prompt and_attentive
be_prepared_to spend some money
the_dhaba isn't cheap
our bill_came in just under
it's_not_the type_of place i_can afford to_eat_at on_a_regular_basis but_it's fantastic for a_special occasion
if_you're_a fan_of_indian_food or looking for_something new
i_don't_think the_dhaba will disappoint
love_this_place
vegetarian offerings are fantastic_and plentiful
the_restaurant_is honestly a_tad small_but this has_never been too_much of a_problem in_the few_times that_i've visited
best lamb_chops ever
briyani was_awful
curry mixed_with rice and_was_very spicy
but why care_about briyani when other_dishes are very_nice
i_think maybe the_bf and_i_are cursed
i_believe that this_restaurant_is awesome
but we_just came at the_wrong day_and time
we_went_here tonight with_a deal chicken deal that_was like for worth of_food that included
four beers glasses_of wine
two apps
two mains
two sides
two desserts
and_two chai teas
well
the_place_was overrun by_a table_of about
so the_service_was slow and_they ran out_of chai
only having enough_to give us like half_of one glass
also
they_only brought_us each one drink
so i_felt_like that was_kind_of lame
especially considering we_had_to pay tax and tip on ' ' worth of_food
when_we really got maybe worth of_food
pretty lame
other_than_that
the_place_was good
we_got_the fried paneer
which_i actually wasn't a_huge_fan_of
kind of bland
but_then i've_never_had paneer
so_that may just_be what_it tastes_like
the_app with_the fluffy bread_and chickpea_curry was_really_good
the_bread_was almost_like a savory donut or_something
yum
for mains we_got chicken_tikka_masala_and lamb_korma
i_usually love_the ctm
but_i_think_the pieces_of_chicken were_too big
which_made them kind of dry_and not_as flavorful as_it could_be
the_lamb_korma
however
was_wonderful
the_meat_was super tender_and the_curry_was great
they_also_had good basmati_rice_and garlic_naan
for_dessert i_got their 'ice cream' which_is more ice y than creamy
almost_like frozen rice_or something
but it_was_very_good
the_bf got_the rice_pudding_and enjoyed_it
we_also enjoyed the_chai
what_we_got of_it anyway
so i_would_probably return and_eat way less food
but maybe i'll be_more picky when_it_comes_to using deals at_this_place
as_it didn't_really turn out_to_be a_deal at_all
the_dhaba_is the indian_restaurant_that i frequent almost monthly
yes
i_order the_same two_dishes all_the_time because they're very_good
chicken_tikka_masala_and butter_chicken
they're soo good
unfortunately
here they pretty much taste the_same
it's_not the_best_indian_food_i've_ever eaten
but_it sure is_one_of_the better_indian_restaurants in_the_valley
i've also_tried_the spinach chicken_saag
was_pretty disappointed
came out very_bland and no_spice at_all
maybe it_was_an off night_for this
consistency is_very important to_me in_a_restaurant and usually this_place delivers
stars_for creating tasty food_and_great naan overall
but lacking that extra deliciousness for a_perfect score
service_is_good
you_will_have multiple servers throughout your dining_experience
this_is often a_good_thing
the downside
there's usually_a long_wait on_the_weekends
very long_wait
if you're on_the fence about trying_it
i'd say just go_for_it
you'll most likely enjoy_it
at least i_keep coming_back_for more
wow
my_wife_and_i have_been_going all_around scottsdale tempe sampling different indian_food
and the_dhaba_is our new_favorite
the_onion pakora were seasoned_and spiced perfectly
lamb kofta_was great
the_meat_was super tender
we_ordered
medium
spice_level
but it_seemed pretty mild to_us
spice_level is_all relative of_course
just sayin'
it's_a pretty_small place
we_didn't have reservations
saturday_night at pm ish
and_waited about_minutes
not_bad at_all
but it_was_just of_us
so if_you_have larger party be_sure and call ahead
food service_was_quick
i enjoyed_my trip_to the_dhaba
i_have_never eaten_indian_food before so my_wife wanted me to_try_it
because she loves it so_much
we_ordered_a veggie platter
which_was amazing
the_fried onion treats were exceptional
the_chicken_tikka_masala was_also_very_good
unfortunately the_lamb boti kabab was very_disappointing
it_was_so dry_and tasteless
no joke it_was_like boot leather
i_even asked the_waitress if_it was_supposed_to_be that dry_and she said
everything here_is well done
but quite honestly that_was_a disgrace
lamb should be moist_and delicious this_was like steak that_you_get at denny's at
am
as_a side note there gulab_jamun was breath taking
i'm_not_a desert guy but i_would_suggest this to_anyone try
the_dhaba_is on http
www
restaurant
com so you_can_get_a great discount and i_would_give the_green light to_try_it just_don't order the_lamb
this_place_was tried on_a whim which_had to_do_with all_the rave reviews
while_i enjoyed_the_food
it_is far_from the_best indian_cuisine i've_had_in_the valley
my_husband_had never_really had_indian
so i_was_excited_to expose him_to my_favorite_dishes
the_veggie platter was_delicious
as_was_the chicken_tikka_masala
my_only complaint_was the_lack_of chicken_in_the dish
we ordered_the_lamb boti kabab and i_was_disappointed
the juicy tender lamb i_was_expecting ended up being dry_and leathery
the_waitress offered no apology except to_tell us_that
everything_is cooked_well done
this_was beyond well done
the_highlight_of the_evening was_their gulab_jamun
so light_and delicate and perfectly_cooked
would i_go_back
perhaps
but i_think_i'll keep hunting for better indian_restaurants_in_the east valley
the_food_is_really great
a_couple_of us went in_there a_week or_so ago to_try_it_out
neither_of us are_too familiar_with_indian_food and_we_were a_little concerned
but it_was_amazing
everything_we_had was_delicious
the_restaurant_was very_clean_and the_service_was_excellent
we_weren't a_fan_of the_desserts
but everything_else_was very_good
the_portions_are large
so_we_had plenty to_take_home
we_will_definitely_be_back soon to_try_some other_items
i'm quite impressed_with_the dhaba
it's_a_little small_restaurant surrounded in what_is called the_india plaza in_tempe
truthfully
i_can't pronounced what we_ordered
but_it_was damn_good
my_friend_ordered some marsala that was_pretty awesome which i_can at least say marsala haha
overall the_food_was_a excellent
service_was okay and_quick
however_the cc issue kinda got to_me when_they couldn't charge yes different cc correctly
ambience was_probably my_favorite
the decors where pretty authentic i gathered and_felt like_i_was transformed to_a time where all storys start_with
long ago
metal plates_and water cups
what shall we sacrifice next har har
the_food_is way_too spicy and_the numbering system for spiciness levels is_definitely off
we_ordered_a and_a spiciness level
the_difference between_the two were more_like_a and_a
even_for a_spice loving indian
this_indian food_place was_way off
the_naan_is superb
don't bother ordering the_tandoori roti
quite a_disappointment
also the_shrimp were spectacular
too_spicy
but_still very_good
keep in_mind that you_might need reservations if_you_go on_weekends or holidays
just call ahead
the_ambiance inside_is quite_nice and_a job well done
i_chose this_place_and took other_people with_me
and wow was_i embarassed about picking this_place
none of_us_were happy
in_fact we_were_all pretty unhappy
the business owner manager wasn't the_best with customer_service nor communication
the_appetizer was_okay but_then all_of_the entrees_were
well
gross
we hardly touched our_food
the_owner seemed irked when_she saw our_plates full_and made things very uncomfortable
if_you_want delicious_indian in a_pleasant environment
this_is_not it
i_have_eaten indian_food_at several restaurants and_i truly believe this_is the_best_i've_had
it_is_very flavorful
authentice cuisine
everytime i_have_had indian_food somewhere_else after eating_here
i_have_been disappointmed
although it_takes a_while_to place an_order and receive your_food
it is_clearly family_owned and operated so i_don't_even mind
the_dhaba is_my_favorite_indian_restaurant in_the_valley
the_only_reason i'm_not giving_it stars_is because_the service_can_be a_bit_slow at_times
i_love_the decor and_the_ambiance
it's_a_small restaurant but_it's beautifully decorated
it's much nicer in_the inside than it_looks on_the_outside
i_read quite a_few people complain about the_prices
i've_always thought their_prices were a_tad bit high
until this last_visit
when_i noticed on the_dinner_menu
full meal experience
choices
i_got_the vegetarian version for
it_came_with a_salad
delicious
a_generous helping of_naan
their_naan_is incredible
daal
lentil stew
rice
yogurt
and the_main_course
which_was_a garbanzo bean dish
the_final course was rice_pudding_and chai_tea
i_was full_and happy for
my_boyfriend got_the lamb_and_chicken option
which_was
but_still a good_deal for_the_amount_of_food he_got
we_both thoroughly_enjoyed the
full meal experience
and would_order them_again
they_also_have_a new rewards card for repeat customers
which_is_great
we
husband_and_i
love the_dhaba
our_first two visits were_pretty different_from each_other
so we_waited until our third visit_to formulate a_solid opinion on_the place
it's_a very thorough four_stars for_us
the_food_is five_star good
it's that simple
we_love_the crisp
cumin laced poppadums
spelled many ways once translated to english
pappadams
papadums
etc
they_serve while_you wait_for your_order and_the choice_of three sauces
husband dips with_the chili_sauce
i mix the_sweet tamarind_sauce and_the chili_sauce
their_chicken_tikka_masala contains very tender_chicken
and consistently has a_nice spice blend
level_of cilantro
and velvety texture
we find_it sometimes has a_little_less chicken in_it than the_chicken_makhani
makhani murgh
and husband isn't_a sauce guy
but_he orders it every_time anyway
the murgh makhani
often translated as butter_chicken
is tied for the_best_i've_ever_had
the_sauce is a_rich
as the_name would_suggest
blend_of butter
pureed tomato
and cream
and_it_is studded with plump golden sultanas
not raisins
guys these_are not hard
chewy blobs
and cashews
the_chicken has its trademark bright red skin and is_so
so
so_tender
seriously
so_tender
their mango_lassis are the_best_i've_ever_had
and_i've had_indian all_over_the place nyc
london
they_are thick
fruity
and_perfectly sweet
which_means not_overly sweet
not under sweetened
the_garlic_naan_is superb
we always_order two
they_use real minced garlic_and it_is_always a_nice balance_of crisp_and tender
no gummy naan at_the_dhaba
great gulab_jamun
but like most_indian_places
they cost quite_a_bit
the_service_is where_i quibble the_staff_are super_nice
and_super personable
the_kitchen just seems_to be slow
our_first_visit
we_waited a longish time
but_not so_much_that we noticed anything out_of_the ordinary
on_our second_visit
we_waited a_full fifty minutes_from the_time_we ordered to the_time_we received any food naan included
it_all came out together fifty minutes_after we_ordered_it
eek
there were_only a_few_other patrons in_the_restaurant at_the_time
too
the_food_was still blow our minds good
so_we_decided to_give_them one_more chance
and we're glad_we did
because the_wait was very_reasonable our third time
and_the_staff especially attentive
and they_brought the_naan out for_us_to graze on while we_waited perfect
in_short eat at_the_dhaba
the_food_is_outstanding
the_wait time_is tolerable
and the_staff_are kind
we absolutely_loved the_dhaba
from the_moment we_walked_in
we knew_we were in_for_a treat
it's_a quaint little restaurant_in_the indian plaza
and_the_place settings were what really caught my attention
now here's a_little breakdown of_my rating
service
extremely_friendly
family oriented and_always knew when to_come to_the_table
drinks_were refilled accordingly
and_the_owner is_so darn nice
she gave great_suggestions and_even brought_out_a surprise dessert for_my fiance's birthday
food
we_ordered
udta panchi chicken_wings marinated_in dhaba spices_and baked in_a clay_oven
absolutely_delicious and_extremely moist
garlic_and khasta keema naan
minced lamb stuffed naan
the textures were wonderful
lightly crispy on_the_outside and delectably soft and_chewy on_the_inside
the_chutneys were_delicious as_well
chicken_tikka_masala of_course a signature dish_of most_indian_restaurants
it_was flavorful_and had_great body
smothered this_on rice_and scooped it up_with_the naans
and you've got yourself one killer meal
sikandri jhinga saag
shrimp and_spinach with herbs and_spices almost like_an_indian creamed spinach just no cream
light_and flavorful_and accompanied the_other_dishes quite well
great_with the_naan_and a_little_bit_of chutney
the_only_reason_i wouldn't rate this_restaurant stars_is because_i would actually like to_experience the consistency of_their service_and_food quality
there_are many fantastic indian_restaurants_i've_been_to
and_although i_loved dhaba it_still comes_in a close second to_another indian_restaurant_that i_enjoy going_to out here_in_vegas
but_i'll tell you_what dhaba was unforgettable
my fiance and_i still talk_about our_meal
so_maybe they_do deserve that extra star
dhaba_is considered an_authentic punjabi cuisine
i_have_been_to many north indian_cuisine restaurants
and_i_have an idea_of what most_of_the_dishes are
unfortunately with the_dhaba
you_would have some_of_the similar lingo
but the_name would_be so_long with_other adjectives or punjabi words that confused the heck out_of me
we_finally figured out what_we_wanted
and_ordered from_our cute waitress
we_got_the chana_masala
palak_paneer
and mutter_paneer
for breads we_got garlic_naan_and something else with_a sweet taste
the_food_was average at_best
and the_portion_sizes were_extremely small
i had_a_groupon for for
and i_can_see the_groupon covering up the_lack_of quantity
the_ambiance_is this place_is_pretty well light_and glowing for_a_nice date who wants_to try ethnic cuisines
it_is_a decent place
but i_would_not come_here if you_really hungry
pretty scrumptious
we_had so_much_food it_was nuts
my_friend_had a restaurants
com_coupon so we_went_to town
we_ordered_the takki nakki
jk i_dont remember the_name
it_was potato pancake with_onions and_other amazing things
it_was_so insanely good
you_must get_it
it's_one_of the_most recommended things in the_yelp_reviews and_it's_a starter so look_for it
then we_ordered_the_chicken fritters
they_were basically like indian_style chicken nuggets
curry and_mango served_with_a garbanzo bean dipping sauce
pretty_good
then we_ordered_the full experience meal
it_came_with chicken_tandoori
indian_style fried_rice
amazing
chicken_or lamb_curry
a_salad
a_dessert
we_got one_of both and the_rice_pudding was the_way_to_go
and chai_tea
i_loved_the little crispy thing they_served before our_meals with sauces
so amazing
we_also ordered_garlic naan_which_was amazing
the_service_was weird
there's_a girl who fills up_your water but_she doesn't answer any questions
you_have_to wait_for the_hostess waitress
she_was super sweet but_it_was slow
once you_order
the_food_comes quickly and_there_is just so_much_food
if_you_like bland food
don't_come_here you boring white person
jk
kinda
be advernturous
excellent atmosphere_and wonderful service
the_food_is the_best_indian pakastani food_i_have_ever_had
this_was_my second time going and_i plan_to return again
also be sire to_check_out their store next door
awesome_place
overrated place
great_for americans
it of you_want real quality_indian_food there_is better to_be had in_tempe
nice_atmosphere here_but it's_definitely in_a bad neighborhood
the bottom_line was this_place could be_a_bit closer_to stars if_it_were not_for_the super tiny portion_size
they_are really trying_to keep people on_a diet in_this_place
it's no kebab or india gate in_the quality dept imo
classy food
very_good ambience great deals always
i've known dhaba since its inception the_quality_of_food has always_been impeccable
veg korma
malai_kofta the_sampler platter are some_of_the favorites
one_of_the best restaurants in_tempe a_must visit for very_good_indian_food
we_had_a coupon for_this_restaurant from restaurant
com
excellent choice_for new year's day lunch
interesting assortment_of menu_items
good_service
mostly
some observations
there_are_some appetizer menu_items that_are purported to_be
indian street treats
we have_come across these before
excellent
we_tried_the papdi chaat
which proved superior to others we've_had
if_this_is what people eat on_the streets of_india
perhaps it's time to_visit
they_offer thali platters
which doesn't seem common in_phoenix
wonderful to_have a_variety_of tastes to_try
medium
spice was_not_very hot
two_different servers_were taking care_of our_table
they_kept repeating each other's actions
we_asked_for a box
one went to_get_a box
the_other comes up_and cheerfully asks
would you like_a box
same with dessert_and the_check
the unisex bathroom is designed such that if_you_are sitting
hovering
on_the toilet
you_are face to face with_a urinal
we will_go_back
especially_if another_restaurant
com_coupon appears
nice_place
had somosa
naan
veggie_korma
saag_and vindaloo
food i_would_give
on_a_scale of_a
food_was_good but off a_bit_on the_flavor
one_of_the_better places_i've_been to in_az for_indian tho
i_would_come again
at pm_on_a wednesday we_were_the_only customers
service_was_friendly
but slow
the_servers manager were too_busy chatting on_the_phone in_the_back or eating their own lunch
another group departing as we_came_in seemed_to be waiting at_the_front counter for_about minutes_for the_girl in_the office to_finish her phone call and close their tab
food_was_good
reasonably_priced for_a_lunch combo with more_than enough_food
of us_ordered the_lunch_special
vegetarian
chicken
which_were all_good
although_the heat_level was_off
the vegetarians asked_for heat_level
offered range_of
while the_chicken_was requested as_a
both came out around a
why bother asking if_you're_not going_to follow through
portions_were good_but oddly served
lunch combo includes salad
chutneys
rice
naan
entree
side
and desert
for_our group_of we_were_served bowls of_rice_and pieces_of naan
we_didn't run out
so it_was_ok
but seemed odd when everything_else_was served_in individual dishes
we had_to_ask_for the_salad and_chutneys which_were forgotten
masala chai_tea
which to_me is_the barometer of_quality for_any restaurant
was_just_ok
too_much fennel anise flavor
and too thick heavy being made with_a_lot_of whole milk
i checked_in on_yelp
which_is how i_found_the place
after my_first choice and favorite udupi turned_out_to be closed out_of business
yelp specified it_was open for_lunch
and_offered a_for coupon
which_i purchased
it_wasn't until the_end_of_the_meal and attempting to_pay that_i_was rudely told_the promo wasn't valid with the_lunch_special
i_told her that_wasn't mentioned in_the terms
she made_some excuse and wandered off
i_decided i'd just take_it up_with yelp later
and put my card in_the folio
unfortunately she disappeared and_after about_minutes of waiting i tracked her down in_the office behind the_hostess stand
knocking on_the door_and interrupting her personal phone call
at_that point i_was getting upset
with_the_service and called her out_on_the yelp promo
insisting that the_only restrictions are that it's_not valid for_takeout or on fridays saturdays
she disagreed but finally said she'd honor it_and wrote down_the promo code and adjusted my_bill
overall the_food_was_good but service_was unacceptable
portions_and prices if ordering the_lunch combo were reasonable but ala_carte and dinner_menu pricing were excessive and_the_portions_are probably the_same judging by other_reviews
i_would_not return given the_variety_of other indian_options in_the_area
wow this_place_is_great
but small
be_prepared_to wait_for_a_table especially on_the_weekends but the_wait is worth_it
service_can_be sporadic sometimes great
sometimes inattentive
but_i_can overlook the quirkiness of_this_place as_soon as_the excellent_food arrives
have tried_many
many land and chicken_dishes each perfectly and uniquely spiced with high quality_ingredients
the_rice_is always perfect
and the_bread selection
garlic_naan_and onion kulcha are favorites
are always_fresh
slightly crisp
and_delicious
this_little restaurant may serve up the_best_indian fare i_have_ever eaten
it_is indeed a_rather small_and unpretentious place_in_the center of_indian plaza
there might be ten tables at_most and reservations are a_must
they_actually had_to turn away people while we_were_eating
the_menu_is enormous
the_foods well described and_the choices unique even_for punjabi cuisine
the_chili stuffed naan was_delicious_and different
the_chicken_vindaloo was rich_and fragrant
if a_little_on_the tepid side_of_the heat scale for_me but then_again just_about all food_is unless i_order it_spicy
the_okra was_the_best i_have_ever_had and_my wife's chicken_tikki was_superb
the food_was_served quickly_and the_servers_were friendly although a_bit distracted
we drove minutes_from anthem to_eat_here and_we_will return
i_highly_recommend the_dhaba
the_tikka_masala is_to_die_for
love_the_food here
the_staff_is also super patient about explaining the_menu
this_is far_from home but_i'll still make_the journey
i hav dreams about the_tikka_masala
first up
certainly not_the_best_indian_food in_the_city
having said_that
not_bad either if_you_are_in_the vicinity
i'm obviously picky_about this cuisine as its native to_me but_i also know i_won't get close_to tasty_food here
having said_that
it's_good if_you_want_to try_indian_food
i_had_the chaat
not authentic but refreshing
little india in_tempe has better flavor
for the_main_course had the_saag murgh
spinach chicken
and goat_curry
the_goat was_better
the_dessert however was_quite_good
got the_kheer
rice_pudding
which was_very_flavorful
the_ambience_is nice
the_service a_little_slow but_the_staff quite friendly but_not sure_how well they_know their stuff
you_won't_be disappointed_by your experience but_you won't come_back blown_away either
good_indian_food
we_went_to celebrate a classmate's birthday and_had_a really_good time
i adored the tableware
it_was heavy and_had_a
medieval
feel
the_lunch_special is a_really_good deal
i'm not_a_fan_of paneer_and that_was_the day's veggie lunch_special
so i_got_the veggie wrap instead
it_was_excellent
so were_the fries
more fries please
the waitresses weren't that personable and_although the_lunch_special includes dessert
they asked my_friends if they_still wanted_it
huh
i_didn't_have a lunch_special
so_i used my handy dandy yelp_check_in offer for_a free dessert
so_i_could get_some rice_pudding
i've been_eating rice_pudding all my_life and have_had many_different versions
liquidy rice_pudding
no thanks
thank god we_had_a terrific birthday cake
my_girlfriend_and i_love_this_place
not_only_is the_food beyond delicious
i_think_the portions_are fine and_the_service_is second to none
the woman who manages could_not be nicer and_the gentleman who works the_shop next door
and who i suspect is the_owner
is_always making sure_that we_had_a superb dinner
we_do enjoy trying different indian_restaurants_in_town
but we_still count the_dhaba as the_standard by which all others are to_be measured
i_wish these folks the_very best
even good restaurants come_and go_in this economy and_i want the_dhaba to_be around for_a_long
long time
nice smaller restaurant
good_service
awesome vegetable_korma
the_dhaba is_the_best_indian_restaurant in_phoenix
located near asu
it's_in_a good location
you_would_expect to_find a_lot_of students there given the_location but_i haven't found_that to_be_the case
but
i_usually go_for_dinner maybe it's different at lunchtime
the_ambience_is very relaxed but trendy upscale compared with most_indian_restaurants
the_owner_is extremely gracious and_the_service_is excellent
the_food_is absolutely_delicious
really
the_best_in town
their_lamb
usually a_good test of the_chef's skill
is_perfect
juicy
flavorful
very_tender
it practically melts in_your_mouth
everything i've_eaten here has_been excellent and_i'm an adventurous diner who tries many different_dishes
the prices_are_very_reasonable and_they frequently send coupons if you sign up for_their email list
i_strongly recommend making a_reservation in_the evenings
especially on_friday and_saturday because
otherwise
you_may not be_able_to get_a_table
this_was_our third trip_to the_dhaba in three months_and it_was_excellent
as_always
the service_was_attentive and_the_food_was outstanding
their_food_is the_best
and most_authentic punjab
in_the_valley
this visit we_had five adults and the_entire bill_was just
crazy reasonable
the_paneer_was excellent
the mango_chicken yummy and_the_lamb_was so mouth_watering
their_garlic_naan is_great
we skipped dessert tonight
but last_visit had_their rice_pudding
yum
after we_left the_restaurant we_got_a telephone call from_them saying_that
the gentlemen sitting_on the_end_of_the table dropped
and we_needed to_come_back for_our money
he'd never have_known the dfference if_they hadn't called us
so_we_were extremely impressed_with this kindness and honesty
all in_all a_great_experience once_again
i_love_this_place and plan to_go_back as_soon as possible
i_don't_have anything negative to_say about_our dining_experience
sure
the_outside of_the_restaurant looks a_little cheesy
but the_restaurant_itself_is darling
they_make incredible lamb somosas and_a rich_and very_flavorful lamb_korma
the_lamb_was_tender and_delicious
i_ordered garlic_naan_and my_partner ordered something similar_to naan
but_there_were cooked red onions throughout
i_can't remember_the_name_of it
but let me_tell you
it_was_fantastic
i personally don't think_the neighborhood_is that_bad
and_i've_been in bad neighborhoods
no
i wouldn't_go for_a midnight stroll around there
but for_lunch
it's safe
one_of_the reviewers said
great_for americans
well tell that to_the pakistani family who came_in and_ordered a_bunch_of food
our portions_were big
we_couldn't eat_it all
as_for_the heat
they ask you how hot you_want_it
huge_menu
if you're new_to_indian_food be_prepared_to be confused
waiter_was helpful with recommendations
chicken_tikka_masala_was delicious as_was_the garlic_naan
the_vindaloo_was spicy
it_comes at_a spice_level
i_took one bite and my_head decided_to_go swimming
in_my sweat
good_thing is_they keep the_place extremely chilly and serve water in these metal cups that keep the_water ice cold
service_was_also great
they_kept that ice cold water refilled as_i_was trying_to put_the fire out in_my_mouth
i_have_not been_to_many_indian restaurants but_i_am very_happy i_tried_the dhaba
they_have coupons on restaurant
com btw
be_sure_to log in_and buy one
it's a_great_deal
the_table was set beautifully with traditional plates_and glasses
i_really_liked that
it_takes a_while for_the_food_to come_out so be_sure_to order appetizers_and place your_meal order_at the_same_time
the_menu can_be_a_bit shocking to_take it_all in_at once
i_did my homework and viewed it online before we_went so_i_could figure out_what i_wanted
the_naan was_so_delicious
go_for_the garlic_naan
i_have_been_to the_dhaba three separate times_now
the_food_is_good
but certainly not_the_best_indian deliciousness i_have_tasted
the_wait_staff_is friendly
the_service_was_good
and the_decor_and cleanliness were_both very_good too
however
i_think the_dhaba_is overpriced compared_to the_small portion_sizes
i_really was_expecting more_for the_money than_what_i got
also
i_am a_fan_of spicy foods and_really hate it_when ethnic restaurants mild down their spiciness levels when serving to american eaters
call it_a pet peeve of_mine
each_time_i ordered here they of_course asked_me how_spicy i_wanted my_meal
stars
and_i told_them
stars
extra
extra_spicy please
however
what ended up on_my_plate was maybe about stars
very_mild compared_to what_i like and_what i_was_expecting
that left_me very_disappointed so after_my third attempt
i decided_that this_would in_fact not become a_regular ethnic eating place for_me
the_flavors_are good
but the_heat is missing
the_good
awesome_food
or_at least very_good_food
my mango_chicken had a_bit_of_a bite to_it even_though_i ordered_it mild
but the_flavor_was good
hubby loved his_food
our rose lassi was_good
but small_for_the_price
the appetizers_were all_delicious although i_don't_remember any_of_the names
the not so_good somewhat sullen service
we_had trouble getting_the waitress's attention several different times
she balked at splitting the_check between two_different parties even_after we marked which dishes went onto each tab
most irritatingly
they tacked an tip onto each tab even_though_we only_had a_party_of
adults
child
i didn't_see anything on_the_menu about_the predetermined tip
most_places that do this only do_it for parties over
or and_it_is almost always mentioned on_the_menu
this_was really a_major irritation after_the mediocre service
tasty
pricey
parking sucks
really_tasty
but kinda pricey
location could_be better
service is_okay
kinda slow
excellent_service
nice venue
delicious_food
only thumbs down was_that each entree we_ordered had only_a_few cubes_of meet each
we_used a_groupon so_not sure_if that_had anything to_do_with it
but other_than_that
pretty_good food
always a_winner with_me
plan_on spending more time where than you_may at another_restaurant
this_is a_good_thing
i_know that someone is making my_food not shleping it onto a_plate from_the microwave
get the_lamb_vindaloo
spicey
upon arriving at_the_dhaba for_a sunday evening meal
we_were_greeted very quickly_and kindly and_told that_there would_be_a minute wait_for_a_table
having read_the_reviews of previous patrons
i_was slightly frustrated because_i knew it_would_be a_wait once we_were_seated to_get_our food also
however
after a_few_minutes
i_decided i_would be_prepared_to wait and_enjoy a_nice
slow evening_and meal
and remember to make_reservations for future visits
once seated
it_did take some_time to_get_the order in
but_it_was well worth_the_wait
the_masala chai_tea was spiced to_perfection
fragrant
and with_some added honey
it was_the_perfect beverage
i_had_the vegetarian
meat
balls
i_can't recall the_indian name
which_were satisfying and savory_and did_not_disappoint
everything came out piping_hot_and fresh
i_will most definitely_be a returning patron
i_love_this_place a_lot
but_there_are a_few_things you_need_to know
make_a_reservation
even_if it's tuesday at
and you're already en route
i've_had to wait_for_a_table in_the room full_of empty tables simply because_i didn't call ahead
never pay full price
they always_have a_groupon
living_social
restaurant
com or other coupon available somewhere and paying full price is_a_little steep
get the_garlic_naan
each veggie dish i've_had i've loved
you can't_go_wrong
the_paneer dishes_are rich_and delicious_and make_me fat and_happy
would give_this_place_a higher rating if the_service wasn't_so spotty
the_food_is_great
came_here_for restaurant week and_got a_great_deal
an_appetizer
two curries_and dessert with_two chai's for
we_went ahead_and bought two bottles of_wine just_for fun too
i've been_in here_before and_there_is_a very_sweet server who makes recommendations and brings out the_food
the weird part_was that this_time
we barely saw her and instead were basically ignored by all wait_staff
two_other folks
we had_to_ask_for the_restaurant week menu
which they_had hidden
they then proceeded_to forget_to bring_out the chais and hustled us_out of_there until_we reminded them that_it_was supposed_to come_with dessert
service snafu's aside
the_food_is really_good_and hard_to argue with
all_the_great standards are here_and if_they pick up a_bit_on the_service
it_got to_the_point that_we_had all_the plates stacked up to_make_a visual cue
but they_still left the_plates there as we_ate dessert
the_restaurant would_be_a regular outing for_me
great
i_tried_this because i_had_a gift_certificate
i_ordered_the gosht rogan_josh with_lamb and_a chicken with_rice
raisins_and nuts dish
gosht rogan_josh was_spicy
i_only ordered this because_i made this_dish using a_mix from_a box bought at lee lees but_i_think_the boxed version was_much better
i_loved_the garlic_naan
though
one couldn't go_wrong with_this
the_chicken dish_was aromatic and_filling
it_was_a large portion
i'd_go back_to_try other_dishes
though
parking_is tight
we_did_not make_the trek to the_east_side with the_dhaba on_our minds
but as_we drove past it to_our intended destination
i_said
look honey
that's dhaba
it_gets great_reviews and has_been written up in_phoenix magazine
the_main man replied
its indian
right
we like_indian
that naan_bread
mmmmmm
so we_did what we_went east to_do and_decided we_had_to give the_dhaba a_go
there_was no wait even_though_we had_no reservation
the_hostess waitress manager_was an absolutely gorgeous young woman who_was very_much into_our learning experience_and helped us sound out_and pronounce our_orders
lamb_dishes for both_of_us
we_were given water_and tea in_a more_than timely manner and_the slight wait_for our hand made
fresh_food was well_worth_it
mm got_the basmati_rice_and i_opted
reluctantly as_i steer clear of_most carbs unless they_are chocolate cake or cookies
for_the brown_rice
both_were fabulous with_the moist
tender lamb
both_dishes of_lamb were spicy without burning and the_flavor_was finally noticeable
most indian_food_in_the_valley honestly lacks heat
kick
and_flavor
these_dishes delivered in all_three
what i_did_not notice until it_was time for_the 'go' box is_that_the brown_rice has the_most elegant
aromatic scent
i may_not actually eat_it
but_i_will go_to_the fridge a million times just_to smell it
all in_all
we_were lucky to_grab up a_table with_no reservation
the_food_was_awesome
the_service pleasantly solid
we are_just sad the_dhaba_is way across town
everything i_have_ordered here or tasted from_a friend's entry has_been delicious
i_love_indian_food anyway with_its
sneaky spice
and_delicious warm flavors
the_naan here_is delicious
and_one order could feed four to five people
i_have_ordered the dal_makhani
punjabi chole
dil bahar korma
and sialkoti rajmeh
and_all_of these had delicious flavors_and spice
you_can determine the_level_of spice
like most_indian_restaurants
the entries come_with white or brown_rice
the only_complaint i_have is_that_it can take a_while even_after seated
both_times i have_gone for dine_in
it_was fairly crowded
but_it_was at least minutes_before someone even came_by to_ask_for our_orders
however
due_to_the extensive_menu
this wasn't a_problem
since_there are_many delicious items_in which to_choose
we_needed that time
water refills are constant and_the_food comes_out quite quick after ordered
i'm also excited to_know they_are_open till pm
the lakhvavi shahi_paneer is_delicious as_well_as_the garlic_naan
i_love_this_place
amazing_food
good_food
we_ordered achari murgh and dal_makhani
very overpriced
i_have_been_to dhaba a_couple_of_times and i_have_never_been impressed_by their_food
i_am_very particular about_indian_food because i_am indian
i_was forced to_visit dhaba again because everyone_in the_group wanted_to
they_have really improved the_quality_of_the_food
i definitely_recommend their paneer_tikka_masala and chilli naan
the_naan_is not_too spicy_and perfect_for the_curries
my_favorite_dish was the_lamb_curry
it was_very_tasty with_good herb and_spice flavors
although_it_was more savory_and less spicy than_other curries that i'm_used_to
it_came_with plentiful
huge chunks_of lamb
i would_get this_dish again and_it_was large enough_for two
especially_if_you add some naan_bread to your_meal
we_had_the plain_naan
it_was_very fresh
crispy
and_flavorful
i_definitely recommend_it
the_other dish we_tried was_the sizzling meat platter
the sausage was spiced nicely with_lots_of cumin
the_red chicken_and kabob chicken_was likewise flavored nicely
again
the_dishes came with_a_lot_of quality meat
so you_will_get lots_of great bites without any filler ingredients
to_drink
i_had_the indian lemonade
which_is not_at_all like fresh or artificial lemonade made in_the u
s
it_was_a_very unique drink based on_a blend_of_spices
juice
and_water
it_was more_of_a herbal drink
i_liked_it
the_food_was a_bit_pricey
but_had excellent flavors
fortunately
the_meals were_quite large_and could_be split by two people_in order to_save money
you_can also look_for groupon or similar coupons online
although they may choose not_to take them
so_i recommend calling ahead or getting_a legally binding contact first
the service_was_a_bit_slow
because only_one person was working both the_hostess table_and serving
the_decor is_very_nice_and clearly designed to with_a classy indian_style
this style flows through the_whole restaurant
from the_walls to the_tables to_the settings
i've_been_here a_few_times
and_i've_been delighted each time
i_try different_dishes each_time_i go
so it's_hard for_me to_say_that i_have_a favorite
vindaloo of any_kind is_my_favorite at_any indian_place
and_this_place certainly won't disappoint if_you_like this_dish
i_had kofta last_night for_the_first_time
and_i absolutely_loved it
i've also tried_their lamb_tikka_masala
which_is awesome
i imagine that everything_is good_here
while the_food_is_excellent
service_is slow_and the_kitchen slower
we_have_been here_many_times but won't be_back
had_a
reservation and_didn't get_out until
after being_seated
it_took about_minutes for_someone to_take_our_order
we_waited over half an_hour to_have_the food brought to_our_table
restaurant needs more waitstaff and more_people in_the_kitchen
very slow_and inefficient
i_got_the full meal experience and_loved_it
i_love indian_cuisine
and this_is_one_of_the best_i've_had_in the_phoenix_area
the_service_was_very_good
the_restaurant_is not_much to_look_at from the_outside
but_the inside_is very high_quality
the chairs and tables are dark
solid wood and the_dishes_are high_quality
my_husband and_i_decided_to celebrate my birthday a_little early
we_had received a_groupon for the_dhaba as_a christmas gift and_decided_to use_it on
upon walking_into to nearly empty restaurant
we_were_seated and_told our_server would_be with_us
once she discovered we_had_the groupon
she told_us they_didn't accept them on_this day because_it_was a holiday
we promptly left
once in_our car we checked the_groupon and discovered that new year's day was_not one_of_the days listed as_a day the_coupon would_not be accepted
so what_the heck
this_is our_second time at_the_dhaba
after receiving shoe leather lamb_and being told it_was always cooked that_way
we almost didn't_want_to give_it_a second chance
after not_being able to_use a perfectly good coupon on day not listed in_the fine print
we will_not_be_returning to_the_dhaba
we'll eat_at star of_india on chandler blvd
instead
the_lamb there_is cooked_to_perfection
great_food
this_place_is cozy
and_had water
flat_bread
and_sauces ready_to go at our_table when we_sat_down
staff_was just_the_right_amount_of attentive
price was_quite reasonable for_the_amount_of_food we_got
favorite_indian_place i_have gone_to in_phoenix
super cute cozy and_comfortable
you_have_to make_a_reservation to_eat_here
but_i actually appreciated it
when we_sat_down there_was water at_the_table
chutney_and papadum to nosh on
i_also wasn't overly bombarded with service
rather
they moved silently
taking plates away when needed and_filling my_water when low
overall the_food_was_very_good
and the_portion_sizes were very_generous
i_hope that_doesn't change
they deviated a_bit from_the classic recipes which_i actually didn't mind
the_owner seems_like a_sweet little lady
and it's_right next_door_to an_indian grocer so_if you're so inclined to_do a_little shopping after your
meal you_can
lastly
tableware is_very classic and cute
while the_decor itself_is modern_and clean
i will_be_returning
this_is part_of india plaza
as you_would_expect
it_is an_indian_restaurant
punjabi
more specifically
i_had_heard good_things from_indian folks i_know
but it_took_me a_while_to come_in
first
don't confuse the cafe next door with the_dhaba
it's_all part_of_the same plaza
same owner
but_the cafe has_a much different menu
much simpler
the_dhaba_is relatively small
perhaps tables
reservations are a_good idea if_you_want_to be_sure_to get_a_table without waiting
the_ambiance_is simple
understated
the plates_and utensils are rather unique
metal plates
with some_sort_of different metal rim piece
i'm assuming these_are traditional
the_menu_is quite extensive
i_didn't really_know what most_of_the items_were
there_is vegetarian as_well as non_vegetarian
but_no beef
which_was not_really a_surprise
the_samosas_were very_good
they_were served_with_a chick_pea dip
or soup
that was_also really_good
we played it
safe
and went_with vindaloo and_tikka_masala
and_both_were excellent also
my_wife did_have the_mango lasse
and_she said_it_was good_but not_as_good_as india_oven
the_rest
however
was_better
the_naan_bread is_not included
you_have_to order_it
it's_good
but_i_think it_should_be included as_it_is in_most other_indian_restaurants
now for_the bummer
the_price
the_dhaba_is probably more expensive than the_next best_indian_restaurant we've found
india_oven
maybe
it_was_all good
but_definitely pricey
despite yelp's scale being
moderate
at perhaps per_person including tip
compared_to others in_its category
if you use
groupon
they sometimes have_one for the_dhaba
and it_really helps
the_one i've seen you_pay_for of_food
we_went over
and the_final bill
after groupon
was_about what_i_would expect_to_pay at india_oven
is_it worth_it
with a_groupon
yes
without
well
that's up_to you
it is_really_good indian_food
there_is_an awful lot_of awful indian_food in_phoenix
maybe i'm_just spoiled by having_a mother that_was granted her powers of cooking by brahma himself
or was_it vishnu
i have_no_idea who dispenses that sort of thing
but_i daresay i've got a_pretty_good idea_of what stellar indian_cuisine_is supposed_to taste_like
that_said
i_believe that the_dhaba has some_of_the_best_indian_food i've tasted outside india
an impressive feat
as the_world is made_up of
of countries that don't happen_to be india
the food_is_pretty authentic
and their_menu_is impressively extensive
the_restaurant offers up_a varied selection_of naan
curries
grilled meat
and_dessert
so most_people are_going to_be_able_to find something on_the_menu_that they'll enjoy
that_is
if_they enjoy north indian_cuisine to begin with
the_only_reason i'm deducting a_star here_is because_i find their_service to_be somewhat inconsistent
there_are days where their service_is stellar
and_other days where i've_found myself waiting_for half an_hour for_a refill on my_water
even so
the_service_is passable most_of_the time
so_i'm_not particularly miffed
finally
i'd_recommend making a_reservation beforehand if you intend on visiting the_restaurant at_all
space is_something of_a premium inside
and_the_place is_usually packed when i've gone
i_usually make_reservations right here on_yelp
so_the process isn't terribly difficult
overall
the_dhaba_is a_restaurant that_i've recommended indiscriminately to friends_and family alike
now_that i've run out_of people_to recommend_it_to
i_figured yelp was_probably_the logical next step
bon appetit
the_dhaba_is perfect
i_could leave it at_that
but_i wont
the_atmosphere_is_nice i_love_their cutlery and plates_and tables
my_husband_and_i love_their papdi chatt appetizer
chicken_tikka_masala is_amazing_and another dish with_spinach an chicken
sorry
drawing a blank on the_name
every_time_we have_been_there our_experience has_been wonderful
i_will add one note
i_am hoping this was_just_a fluke
but the_last_time we_were_in the_owners were_not there_and_the young indian girl working_there had on club music so loud i_could_not here my_husband speak
at_first i_thought ok they just_opened maybe they'll turn it_off
nope it played loudly the_whole time
also_the bus girl and the_indian girl just disappeared we_needed water and_there_was no_one around
we_waited minutes plus for_someone to_get us our_check
we_actually had to_stop the_girl to_ask_for the_check because she just kept walking by
with_this being_said
we_still love the_dhaba
and_will continue visiting often
however if_this ever happens again we might_have to consider finding another place to_get_our indian_food
just ate_here with my_boyfriend_and i_was_very_impressed
we_did_not make_reservations but_it_was a_sunday_night and_i_didn't really take_the reservation thing seriously
i_would imagine that it_might get busy on_a_friday or saturday_night and require reservations though
because_the place_is_not huge
not small either
but_very cosy
we_both ordered_the
whole meal
thalis
my_boyfriend had the_maharaja
all meat
and_i_had the_combo with dal
chick_peas
and_chicken_curry
the_biryani that_came_with the_food_was the_best_i_have_ever had
i_would_go there just to_eat the_biryani alone
the_naan_was top_notch too
everything_was_delicious
i_was_really surprised for arizona
the thalis also come_with chai_and desert
they_were_very accomodating when_i forgot that chai_is brewed with whole milk
i'm lactose intolerant
and_they traded mine out_for a_delicious dark tea
the_service_was a_little_slow
but_still great
the_restaurant_was almost full while_we_were there but_it_was never too noisy
the modern_indian music_was a_nice_touch too
this_place_has now become my_favorite_indian spot
i_have_to express
again
that_their system of placing a_reservation is_very needed and essential
parking_is extremely limited in_the_area
as it's_a shopping_center as_well
i_noticed a_couple come_in without a_reservation
and_were sort of put_off by it
they_do_have a_little seating_area if you forget
and wait_time seems_to be about_minutes or_so
that aside
let's talk about_the_food
i_always leave very full here
with leftovers_for the_next_day
their kormas are divine
i_will recommend the_vegetarian option as it_comes_with cashews and golden raisins
a_little_spicy
sweet
and tart
and savory basically a_perfect meal
the girls
servers
here_are efficient
without being pushy
and attend to each table flawlessly
it_gets an_extra star from_me
today
for the_decor
restaurants really underestimate the power of nice surroundings
the_dhaba definitely took this into consideration when selecting the tableware
the lighting options
tables ect
oh
and p
s
get the_groupon
or check_in on_yelp foursquare to score some amazing deals
i_don't_know why they keep doing this
because they're giving away food for_free
but yeah
ya know
not complaining at the_moment
weekday dinner
staff_was_friendly
food overall was_ok
i've had_a_lot_of indian_food
may be for a_person who's new_to the_cuisine may find_it better
lamb_curry which_came_with maharaj thali was_good
so_was_the garlic_naan
so mey be that's_what i_should_have ordered
we_went_for_dinner on_a_friday_night when visiting family in_the_phoenix_area
it_was crowded but_we didn't_have_to wait_for_a_table
they_have_a very extensive_menu with_a_lot_of vegetarian_and gluten_free options
it_took a_while_to figure out_what to_get though because_there were_so many_things to_read
plus
because everything_was in punjabi
we_had_to read_the descriptions of each_dish
luckily
there_were papadams and_chutneys to snack on
all_the_dishes sounded really_good
we_ended_up getting the_tandoori khazana with a_mix_of chicken_and_lamb tandoori that was_super tasty
the_lamb_and the_shrimp were succulent and_flavorful
and_the_chicken really captured the smoky tandoori flavor
our_second dish_was palak_paneer and_our third was the_lamb_korma
the_paneer was_pretty_good
and the_spinach quite creamy
and with_just_the slightest bit_of heat
the_lamb_korma was_awesome
the_curry is similar_to tikka_masala but way_better with cashews and raisins
the_lamb_was first rate in_flavor and tenderness of_the_meat
we also_ordered dessert
pistachio ice_cream made on site
it_was icy and_delicious and melted in_your_mouth with an_amazing creaminess
the pistachio flavor really shined in_the dessert
we_left stuffed
what a_great_meal
the_ambiance was_very_nice
with beautiful colors and_a warm feeling
the lighting was_not_too bright
but_not so dark that_you couldn't see the_food_on your_plate
the_servers_were chatty and_pleasant
but_the cart they wheeled dishes out_on seemed really out_of place
overall
i'd_come here_again if_i_were in_the_area
a_great_experience and_a delicious dinner
i_love_the look of_the_place
the_food_was tasty_but way_to spicy_for_me
i_ordered very_little spice and_it_was so_spicy that_i_could barely eat any of_it
gonna try_it_again in_the_future and ask_for no_spice and see_what happens
the_chicken was_nice_and juicy instead_of dried out like a_lot_of places tend_to be
oh_and it_was_a_little too warm inside
but_that coulda just been the_day_we went
mmmmmmmm
if_you_are looking_for_a tantalizing taste explosion
go dine_in this quaint
zen like
ethnic hidden_gem
absolutely_delicious
super extensive_menu
great vegetarian_options
go hungry share a_few platters
soooooo bomb
definitely in_a food_coma now
yum
went_here_for dinner after_a_long conference day_and was_super impressed
i_love_their plates_and drinking glasses made_of pewter
they_are gorgeous
however
what impressed me most was their_food
obviously
the_korma sauce_is the_best_i_have_had hands down
take that other_indian_restaurants
it_has_a delicious nutty flavor_and very rich
i_had_the lamb_korma_and left the_dhaba a very_happy camper
a yelp_check_in gets you free dessert
score
if you're frantically looking_for_a restaurant for_an anniversary or a_hot date
then this_is_the perfect place_to take_your significant other
the_dhaba_is a classy
affordable
and romantic venue
this_is definitely_one_of_the top indian_restaurants_in tempe and is_about as_good_as_it gets anywhere
the_service_is fantastic
when_we_arrived the_host greeted us_and seated_us at a_table while setting down a_few roses
i_felt extremely welcomed by the_restaurant host anywhere
and from_the get go i_knew that_this was_going_to_be a_great_experience
as for_the_food
it_was_delicious
i_had_the chicken_tika_masala
i_tend_to order_the plainest items at ethnic restaurants
and_it_was cooked_to_perfection
the_waitress_was very_attentive_and made_sure that_we_were completely satisfied_with our_order
just make_sure_to make_reservations
as this_place_is quick to_fill_up at_dinner
aaaah
real_indian and pakistani food
i'm_a snoot
i'll admit after leaving chicago and devon avenue
i've_always been_disappointed by what passes for
indian
out west
but the_dhaba blew me_away
i_took some visit family here_for_dinner last weekend after_reading positive reviews_on_yelp
and_was sooo not_disappointed
first_and i_love_this
because_i'm lazy you can_make your reservation on_yelp
literally three clicks and_i_had_a reservation for_four at seven
sure enough
our_table_was ready and waiting_for us and_i watched several other parties of various sizes show up_and wait at least fifteen minutes to_be_seated
so_i_was feeling smug before our lhassi was_even on_the_table
service is_a_little patchy
we_had_to request water twice
and flag down_a waitress for our_check
but_the_food_is so dang good i_don't_even care
order whatever you_want off_the amazing
huge_menu it_will_be good
i promise
my relatives had never_had_indian before
i_know
i_don't get_it either
so_i steered them toward the_traditional favorite chicken_tikka_masala
we_requested it mild and_i_think our_server translated that
correctly
to
for old white people
the relatives loved_it
and_i looooved my kafta
and the_fact_that when_you say
i_want it_spicy
the_kitchen makes_it spicy
the_portions_are very_generous
which_means lots_of amazing leftovers to_sit_in your fridge and_get even_more spicy depth and_flavor over the_next_day or_two
and the_rice_pudding deeelish
the_only_thing_that i_wouldn't rave about was the_masala chai_tea
and that's_just because_i like_my chai blend with a_little_more punch
and_this had quite_a_bit of milk in_it
the_ambiance_is lovely_and perfect_for a romantic evening
a_place_to take_your folks when they're visiting and you_want_to prove you're all grown up
or an upscale but_not crazy expensive girls' night_out
we_came with a_large_group and_service_was sloooow
the_highlight for_me was_definitely the_vegetarian appetizer plate an assortment_of flavorful fried bites that_were worth coming_back_for
dinner course was just_okay it_seemed_like almost everyone at_the_table felt_that their_dishes were mostly sauce_with very_little
stuff
in them
kind of made_us_feel like we_weren't getting much for_our money
also
medium
spicy was_not spicy_at_all
very nice_atmosphere and_decor
after purchasing a living_social voucher for the_dhaba
we_decided_to_try it_out on_a_tuesday evening
to preface
the_food_was_fantastic
i_was_very_impressed
i_highly_recommend trying one_of_their entrees prepared in_their tandoor oven
the_naan_bread
both plain_and chili infused
was_delicious
however
their service_was below average
granted
they_did have_a large_party dining_with them
but_there seemed_to be only_one waitress for the_entire dining_room
it_took about_minutes for_her to_even glance our_way and_then greet us
once greeted
she asked_if_we were ready_to order
which of_course we_were_not as we_had many questions about the_menu
i_was given the_wrong glass_of_wine and had_to_wait even longer for_my beverage
again
the_food_was_great
and_i certainly plan_on trying it_out again
especially as_it's so conveniently located
my recommendation to_the_dhaba is_to provide the appropriate amount of staff needed to_run a successful business
especially_when doing a promotional deal_for guests
thus increasing traffic
we_shared the_samosas_and chicken_tikki massala
very_good_food
and_good_service
we_received the_rice_pudding for_our complimentary dessert yelp_check_in
that_was good_as_well
we would_definitely_recommend_this if_you_are looking_for_indian
i_come_here a_lot
the_food_is_excellent
if_your a_fan_of_indian_food this is_a_must_try in_my_opinion
i_am working my_way through_the menu_but the_chicken_tikka_masala will_always be my_favorite and dont forget a garlic_naan its delicious
the_only_thing keeping me_from giving stars_is the spotty service
depending on_the night there may only be_one waitress in the_dining_room and_this_place_is usually busy so make_sure_you make_a_reservation
food_is_excellent
but_i_would strongly suggest_you make_a_reservation
on_our first attempt we_were turned away at pm without a_reservation
we_were in_the_area and_it_was early so we_stopped_in on sat
evening as_we passed by at pm
several open tables but all_were marked reserved
they reluctantly took_us and other_tables that arrived shortly after us
we_waited about min
to be_served
it_was_only annoying because those other_tables had_their orders taken before we_had drink order taken
once we_ordered food_was out promptly
under min
we_loved the complimentary cracker bread_with sauces to_start
dhaba chicken_korma tandori tikke chicken_were fantastic_and worth_the_wait
portions aren't huge but we_still had_leftovers
we'll be making a_reservation and returning soon
amazing indian_food
i_am originally from the_uk
where_you can_get amazing_indian in virtually every city
town_and village
here in_the_us
not_so_much
its hard_to find indian_food_that isnt overpriced
the_dhaba seem_to_have it_all covered
great_food
good_service and fairly priced
we managed to_get_a groupon to_save a_little_more too
the_naan_bread_was a highlight
very_light and_not doughy at_all
we_both_had chicken_dishes that_were outstanding
great_job all round
thanks dhaba
i_saw a_group on and_decided to_give_it_a_try since i_love_indian_food
one_of_the_owners
i_believe
was waiting on_my table_and she_was verrrry nice_and made_the experience that_much better
the_food_was the_best_i_have_had lately
and_like everyone says
you_have_to try the_garlic_naan
i_couldn't believe their
domestic
beers included local breweries
i_got hop shock
i_did make_a_reservation and our_table_was ready for_us even_though_we arrived minutes early
i_will_definitely be_back_for_more
this food_is_so_good
everything orderd has_been delicious
every chicken_dish is_great
i_cant stop coming back
i'm_always craving dhaba
you_must give_it_a try
with_the nan_bread and_yogurt for the_rice_and sauce
mmmmmm
vegans can't trust the_menu
dishes_that have butter are noted as vegan
as is_a dish_with
paneer
in the_name
cheese
newby servers aren't much help navigating through_the mistakes
a for_good intentions
but f for execution
the_owner_is super_nice
but_i've been put_off by some_of_the_other help
especially_if_you arrive without a_reservation
the_food_is among the_best found
and i_would_give an_additional star if the_service_was stronger
and another_star if the_menu had less mistakes
i_took the advice below me on_yelp_and made a_reservation
we_came_in ten_minutes early and our_table_was all ready and set to_go
the_service_was_pretty good
which_i was thankful for because the_reviews below me scared me
however
it_was
pretty early for a_saturday_night so it_was_not busy
we_ordered some_garlic_naan
the_lamb boti kabab
and_the gosht rogan_josh
another lamb_dish
the_naan was_tasty_and warm
the_lamb kabob was_amazing
the pieces_of lamb were huge_and super tasty
the gosht rogan_josh was_extremely tasty as_well
however i_would_have preferred more meat as opposed_to so_much curry along_with it
however this_food was_amazing_and by_far_the_best_indian food_i_have_had in_phoenix
hands down my_favorite_restaurant i've tried in_the_phoenix_area in_the year i've_been_here
great_food
great_service
reasonable_prices
especially_if_you groupon it
great_food
will_go again
we purchased a_groupon for the_dhaba
as avid indian_food lovers
we figured we would_make the_drive out_to the_east valley and_give it_a_shot
the_restaurant_is very_small
so i_would_definitely_recommend reservations
though small it had_a_great ambiance
and_the presentation_was just lovely
their varieties_of chutneys_were delicious and_they_had a_great_selection_of indian_foods that_are not_so common to find_in restaurants
we_ordered several appetizers
a couples of entrees
and_a_few desserts and_absolutely everything_was_delicious
fresh
and_well prepared
the_wait_staff_was friendly_and_attentive
and_a gentlemen who seemed to_be_the owner checked_in with_us towards the_end_of_the_meal to_make_sure our_experience was satisfactory
all and_all we_had_a_great experience
we_live pretty far_from tempe
so the_dhaba may_not be our go_to_indian place
but_when we_are on_that side_of_the city we_will_definitely eat there_again
the_dhaba_is the_only_place i_got for_indian_food in_the_phoenix_area
it's_so flavorful_and they'll make your_meal as spicy_as you'd like
i_don't always know what_i'm ordering
but it's_always delicious
when_we first moved_to phoenix we_made an active effort_to look_for a_great_indian_restaurant
and_we found_it
the food_was_outstanding
had_the chicken_curry_with naan_bread
the_only_thing_that ruined it_was_the obnoxious brat sitting across from_me which_i finally had_to_ask him myself to_be quiet because_i_was trying_to enjoy my_meal
mom was_a_bit pissed with_an evil eye
my thoughts are
if_you_can't control your kid
then stay home
or_at the_very least
have_some common courtesy and common sense to extricate your child from_the scene
after getting my car's oil changed at hon man
i_was feeling a_bit peckish and_decided_to indulge in_some tasty indian_cuisine since the_dhaba was_a hop
skip
and_a jump away
i_wanted an_order to_go
and inquired about getting_a lunch_special
no_buffet
but they_do_have some_great looking daily lunch_specials
unfortunately
they_will only give_you the_lunch deals if you_eat in
so_i browsed through_the extensive regular_menu
the_prices seemed_a_little high compared_to_other_indian restaurants in_tempe
i decided_on the_dhaba signature saag
spinach
dish
there_is_a cute little waiting area where you_can wait_for your food_to_be made
service_was exceptional
especially since_it_was to_go
the_friendly hostess at_the_counter offered me_some water while_i waited
and_even offered_to refresh the cup with_more water for_my trip back_home
the_order came_in a_nice_little brown shopping bag with handles
the_kind you_would find_at higher end restaurants
when_i opened up_the bag
i_had_a really large portion_of saag and_basmati_rice
the_saag had_a_nice balance_of flavors_and textures
i_could taste fresh ginger
some creaminess
and_the delicate flavor_of_the spinach
i_had asked_for_it medium_spicy
and_it_was about right not too_spicy
not_too mild
the_basmati_rice was cooked_well
had_some vibrantly colored grains and_was fragrant from_the addition of_spices such_as cardamom and cumin
overall
it_was_a pleasant meal
and_i_have more_than enough leftovers_for a_few_more meals
i'd_love to_dine_in another time to_try_out more_dishes
and their_lunch
authentic punjabi food_and_great_service
the_spice_level is_a_bit toned down i_ordered_a
highest
and_got what_i_would call medium hot
but they_got me a_bowl_of green chillies so_it_was all_good
try_this_place for_sure
btw i_ordered_the non_veg thali
i'm modifying the_review because the_last_time_i was_here the_food sucked
the_service_was still great and_they switched out a_dish for_us but_the overall food_quality was_lacking
i'm guessing only_the thalis here_are good_as a_person in our_group ordered_one of_those and it_was_good
i_can't_speak the dhaba's praises enough
the_food_is_outstanding
the_service_is_great
the_ambiance_is warm and_welcoming
we_went_for_dinner on_sunday
making reservations on line
when_we_walked_in
our_table_was ready with glasses_of water filled and papadums and_chutneys waiting_for us
we_were_greeted quickly
drink_orders taken
my_girlfriend loves their hot_chai
they_didn't hover around the_table while_we_were deciding
as_it generally takes a_while_to go through their extensive_menu
it's_a_nice
subtle reminder that_they appreciate your business_and want you to_enjoy yourself
we_ordered_a spinach_and chickpea_curry and a_spicy lamb_curry with mangoes and capsicum
with_a_side_of garlic_naan
all_delicious
i_normally get the_chicken_vindaloo but decided to_try_something a_little_bit different
the_naan_is fantastic
i_also have_had the_chili naan_and it's an_excellent compliment
if_you_want_to keep piling the_spice on
and_i do
we_ended the_meal with gulab_jamun
perfect for_two_people
we never_go away_from_the dhaba hungry
we're always satisfied
and we_always recommend_it_to our friends
it's hands down my_favorite restaurant_in_the_valley
very_delicious
we_have visited this_place_on multiple occasions
and it_never fails the_manager is awful
i_have_been with_and without reservations
with reservations the_manager refuses to seat you until the_exact time even_if there_are lots_of empty tables
she will seat people who come without reservations but if_you_have_a reservation you_will have_to_wait till its your_time
even_if your_table is ready with_the reserve sign
you_will sit and watch your empty table till its your exact time
the_food_is decent this_is_one_of_the reasons we keep_coming back
i_have recommended this_place_to a_few people but with_the growing number_of indian_restaurants_in_the metro of phoenix maybe customer_service should be something this_place should work on
foot was_excellent but the_place_is expensive
we_ordered tandoori shrimp
malai_kofta_and okra
all_things were_well prepared_and authentic
ladies and gentlemen
i_have_found my new_favorite indian_food_restaurant
groupon had_a deal and_we snatched it_up as we've been in_search_of trying new places
we_arrived about an_hour before they_were_closed and it_was_almost empty
they_still asked_if_we made a_reservation
we_did
so_it seems_like that may_be_a requirement for later dining during_the week
their table settings are unusual and fit perfectly with the_ambiance
the tin water_glasses keep your water cold throughout your_meal
i searched the_large menu for_starters that weren't deep_fried and_were vegetarian_friendly
but_we settled on the_paneer fritters
they_came with curried garbanzo beans that_had the_perfect amount_of_spice
this cheese is_amazing
you_guys
for my_entree
i_decided_to go_with_the vegetarian thali plate
it_came_with a_large salad
the_veggies on_this were_great
but_the iceberg lettuce was not_the_best choice and it_had_a bit too_much dressing
a curried vegetable
perfection
a lentil and bean side
divine
yogurt side
perfect_for cooling down the_spice
large portion_of colorful rice
pieces_of naan
a_dessert
the_best rice_pudding with mango swirl
and_a chai
the_menu clearly states that you_cannot share the_thali
which i_thought_was hilarious because_it's so huge
no
seriously
i had_leftovers for_more meals after this
my_boyfriend ordered_a taro dish which_they mentioned to_us was 'dry' no sauce
it_tasted a_lot like_a potato and_it_wasn't my_favorite i_love_the sauces and_spices the_most but_he enjoyed_it
our bill_was for an_appetizer
a_large vegetarian thali dinner plate
the taro dish_and of_their indian_beers
each
i'm_a_fan
only one_star off because unless_you order_the large vegetarian plate
all_the_other options_are a_bit_pricey
i_can't imagine that_this_place does a_lunch_buffet but_i may be wrong
best_indian restaurant_in_the_valley
it's_just an over_priced place_with very_little regard to service
we_had_to_wait for half an_hour after which we_got the_table_and the_food_took another half hour to_come
my_husband_ordered an_extra roti which_came after mins of_us just sitting and waiting staring at the_entree
i_ordered_a kashmiri chicken_tikka_masala which_was extremely bland
my suggestion would_be check out curry corner
just_a block away
for half the_price_and way_better taste
all and_all if you wish to blow your money on fraud tasteless indian_food
go ahead_and try_it
yum
this_was_my_first_time trying_indian_food i_am now hooked
we_arrived around_pm on_a_thursday the_place_was_packed we_were_told it_would_be about a_minute wait
we_decided_to stay and_we_got lucky were_seated in about_minutes
we_were so_happy that we_waited
the_food_was absolutely_delicious
so much_flavor
the_only_reason i_am_giving stars instead_of is_because once we_ordered
we_never saw our_waitress again we_had_to ask_the bus boy for_more water he even took_our dessert order
my gf loves indian_food
me well not_so_much as_it always seems_to upset my_stomach
guess i'm_not accustomed_to all_the spices_that are used in_indian_food
maybe that_was tmi
moving on
having just moved_to tempe i_wanted_to take_my gf somewhere to_eat_and since she loves indian_food_i did_a search on_yelp
the_dhaba appeared to_be_a top indian spot according_to yelpers
i_had seen it days before driving by it as_it_is hard_to miss
it hardly looks_like_a place that_would serve indian_food_and rather more resembles some quirky old time western place from the_outside
i questioned whether it_would_be good based on_this alone
surprisingly the_whole plaza is
indian
in_some way
indian market
indian_restaurant
and an_indian cafe
wow
i probably_would not_have come_here if_it weren't for_the exceptional reviews
once you_walk into the_dhaba
the_restaurant_is quaint and beautifully decorated
it_was busy
yet the_atmosphere_was quiet
the_hostess was_attentive and_the_service_was_great
the_food_was wonderful
like_i said
i'm not_a_huge_fan of_indian_food
but i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka and i_loved_it
the_portions_were big
so unless you_have_a large appetite you'll most likely have leftovers
the_food_was a_little_pricey
but it_was_worth_it
i_look_forward_to going back again
i_wanted_to go_and eat_at_the curry corner a_few blocks away
but my_friend who_is a_bit_of_a snob didn't_want_to eat_at_the cc
so off we_go_to the_dhaba
it's_in_a nice location
next door is_a_large indian market
the interiors of the_dhaba_is very_nice with asian inspired furnishings
mostly dark wood
it's actually a_very intimate place
they_serve the_drinks water in_a_very artistic metal drinking glass
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
samosa_and my_favorite
garlic_naan
my_friend_had mostly vegetarian
the_serving size were_more_than enough for_two_people
the_waitress_was very_friendly_and_attentive
it's_really a_must_try for_those visiting phoenix tempe area_and so_i give_it stars
what an absolute gem of a_place
put our name in_for_a table_and while_waiting
went next_door_to check_out_the little shop
what a_pleasant surprise to find_that it_had groceries
religious and decorative items
and_even clothing
jewelry and books
the_owner of the_shop had the_most amazing
gentle energy and spent time talking to my_husband_and_i about_the history of the_shop
i_love how he's mostly concerned with bringing an_authentic_indian experience to tempe with high_quality products
the_shop had_such great energy too
you_could tell a_lot_of love went into_it
the_restaurant next door had amazingly fresh
hot_food like_the kind that an auntie would_make at_home
the_shop owner came_by after_our dinner to_see_how we_liked it
this specific treatment left_a lasting impression that_will keep_me going_back_for years to_come
even_if it's a_bit_of_a drive
great
great_place_for true authenticity and beyond friendly_service
i_can't_wait_to_go_back
this_is now my_one stop shop for all_things indian
i_love_this_place
it_is_the_best indian_food_i've_ever_had
my_husband_had tried indian_food_before several_times and_was not_a_fan but_after purchasing a_groupon he agreed to_try_the dhaba and_absolutely loved_it
it_is_a smaller restaurant_with very cute d_cor and_a relaxing atmosphere
i_recommend putting in a_reservation
especially_if_you go_on the_weekend
some_of our favorites_are the rehriwale dahi bhalle
kashmiri chicken_tikka_masala
and lamb_curry
the_fresh naan_and_rice are_amazing
the_service_is a_little_slow sometimes but the_food_is_always stellar
the_food in_general was pretty_decent
although the_tandori_chicken was_a_bit on_the dry side
the_restaurant_is quite small_and doesn't_have much_of an ambiance
i_wouldn't bring a_date here
in a_word
yummy
the_staff_is helpful_and gracious
the_restaurant_itself delightful
we_have_eaten here_a_few_times and find the_food_to_be consistently delicious
our only observation is_that_the curry_dishes seem to_be_more sauce than_anything else
that_said
we really_enjoy this_restaurant_and its delicious_food
after trying curry corner i_went_on an_indian binge
the_dhaba_is just_as delicious but_the_service lacked
a_smile from the_waiter would_have made this_review stars
one year update
still consistently good
love_this_place
there is_always_a groupon available
definitely_a good_deal
me_and the_wife always_get meals out_of one dinner_here
must eat
i_really_liked_the hara bhara kabab
it's tasty
the_chicken_biryani i_ordered came exactly like_how i_wanted
it_was_spicy and_delicious
i_have_been_here a_few_times_and have_never_had_a bad_experience
whether there_were of_us or
the_food_is_amazing
the_vindaloo will make_you cry
the_korma is_like velvet
the_naan_is crispy on_the_outside
pillowy on_the_inside and melts in_your_mouth
but_what really makes this_place special is_the_service
the_servers treat you_like family
and are_happy to_make recommendations
they_are always happy_and bend over backwards to_make_sure your experience_is a_good_one
food_here_is delicious
vegan_friendly
and service_is_always fantastic
if_you_don't know what_to_order
the_servers_are helpful_and will walk you through the_menu
their_garlic_naan is_some_of_the_best naan i've_had_in_the valley
their service_was_good_and their decor was_very beautiful
we_used a_groupon and the_meal_was a_great_deal
we_would definitely_return
food_was_delicious
i_feel it's costlier than all other indian_restaurants_in_town
food_was heavy and_i_had to_take_a box while returning
definitely_a great_place_to_go for_indian_food
pros
great_food
good_service
cool atmosphere
short wait times
cons
not_much seating
hostess is bland_and uninviting
bathroom is behind a sheet
delicious_food
wide ranging menu
excellent ambiance_and service
highest quality indian_food_in_the_valley
while you're there
you_may also want to_check_out_the indian store right_next door
especially_for fresh indian sweets or samosa
we experienced dhaba with a_groupon
we_went_there during an_off hour so the_place_was relatively empty
we_were humored when the_staff asked_if_we had reservations
was_that necessary
lovely atmosphere and_the_staff_is attentive
we_ordered_the plate specials
mine came_with naan
chicken_curry
chana_masala
dahl and_rice
the_rice_is like_a fried_rice with_various veggies in_it
a_nice_change from the_usual
we_both ordered medium_spicy and_it_was just_right
had the_food been any spicier
it_would_have ruined the_taste
hubby had the_naan
lamb_curry
dahl
tandoori_chicken_and rice
it_was_all delicious
our_meal was complete with chai and_rice_pudding with_a_mango flavoring
there_was plenty of leftovers_for the_next_day
we would_definitely go_back as we_thought this_was_one_of_the_best places for_indian_food
we've been_here a_few_more times_and they_do pay attention_to the spice_levels when_we discuss with_the order taker
if you make_reservations
they set the_table up_and take you_in right away
much better to_eat this_way
although_we have_ordered mild spiciness levels the_last few_times
i_think i_am_going_to give_them_a shot again next_time and order_the medium spiciness level
i_think their_food probably tastes best with spiciness at_the medium level
i_like their_curries and_vegetables better_than_the tandoori meats
very_good_indian_food
this_is first_place i experienced indian
and_i_have_been hooked ever_since
this_is my_go_to spot_for chicken_tikka_masala
it's super flavorful_and is_always_good
i_do wish they_gave more chicken_in_the dish
but it's_a_good because_i usually use_the remaining curry_for my basmati_rice
mmmm
the_service_is fast
i call in_my orders and_i never have_to_wait
which_is_a plus
my addiction for indian_curry is_quite abnormal
lol
but nonetheless
i_can always count on getting a_great_meal here
i_always enjoy_a sqaure deal
and today was no_exception
having_a shiny new_restaurant com_coupon in hand
we_made our_way out_for the_dhaba
i'm not_too proud to partake in a_coupon here_and there
let's face it
why pay when you_can spend after tax and generous tip
now that's smart shopping
this_place was_a_good decision
we really_enjoyed_the_food
they're in_a nice spot right_off_the light rail
they've got_a cool indian
dot not feather
market and adjacent shops to_check_out before
or after
your_meal
the adrak de panje dish
marinated lamb cooked_in the_tandoor for_those of_you who don't know
while tasty
was_a_bit tougher than i_was_expecting
they_could stand to provide a sharper knife with_this item
i_was_here with my_wife_and mother in law and_we_all really_enjoyed_the nawabi murg tikke
marinated chicken_cooked in the_tandoor
overall they_serve great tasting_food and india themed d_cor
the_restaurant dining_area echoed on_the_inside
which_made for an_interesting experience
we_could literally hear what our neighbors were talking about
while_they did_have music it could_have_been_a bit louder
felt like we_could hear every conversation from all_the surrounding tables
and_i expect that_this could_have been overcome with ambiance level music or some interior curtains
at one_of_the shops
we met an_interesting and_awesome guy behind the_counter
my guess is_that he's the_owner
he_told us about different spices_and dietary info about different indian_foods
had_a fun evening learning about indian_foods
happy yelping phoenix
errr tempe i_guess
food_was_great
i_got_the paneer and_my_boyfriend got_the chick_pea something or other
sorry
i_could look it_up
but_i'm too lazy
the spice_levels here_are great_as_well
we_both got_a
definitely enough to_make your nose run
but not_enough to_make_the food unbearably hot
the naan_was_also fresh_and_delicious
i'd_definitely go_back
portion_sizes_are enormous
we_had enough_for us both to_eat a_second meal out_of it
side note
it_feels_like you're eating in_a palace with_the silver cups and plates at your_table
ha
love eating at_this_restaurant
small_place but great ambiance_and awesome_food
this_place isn't bad
the_atmosphere_is_nice
and_the_staff seems friendly enough
but_they_are getting three stars for_a_couple reasons
first when we_finally ordered
it_took quite a_while for_our_food to_come_out
also when_we_ordered
we_ordered some drinks
normally those would_come out before the_food
so
yeah
when_our food_came_out and we_still didn't_have drinks
i had_to_ask twice for_them
second
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka masalla
one_of_my all_time favorite indian_dishes
if done right
this_dish came out under seasoned
no_real flavor whatsoever
plus i_really_like spicy_food
so_i_ordered it_as_a
scale_of to
unfortunately it_didn't taste_like they_had done anything_to spice it_up
last
the_rice_pudding was
ok
however
they apparently leave whole cardamon seeds in_there
and_i happen_to bite full on into one thinking it_was_one_of_the nuts in_the pudding
my_wife_had some ice_cream desert that tasted like_a mango_lassie
but_it_was so rock solid and in_a dish_that just_didn't work
trying_to dig pieces_of the ice_cream off ended with the_entire puck
that's about_what it_looked_like
flying out_of_the small bowl they_put it_in
on_the plus side
the_garlic_naan_was fabulous
in_fact we_got_a second order_of it
anyhow
i_doubt i'll come_back_here again
especially if_i can_find a_much better indian_place closer_to chandler
mouthwatering and ethnic
this_is_by_far the_best_indian_restaurant i_have_been_to in_the_valley
i_can't even remember_what i_ordered when_i_went but
i_remember everything_was_delicious
probably_the_best food_i_have_ever eaten
i_know this sounds dramatized
but
you_could probably eat_a napkin there_and it_would_be the_best napkin you have_ever_had
good_food
the_wait time_was too_long for_a pick up
their dal_makhani was_good
seriously
like the_good from the_dhaba
it's a_little_pricey
they occasionally have groupons which_makes it_more reasonable
they're very into having reservations
it's_a_small restaurant and_when we've gone
their tables fill up
i_do recommend calling ahead
the faislabadi aam murgh is_very_good if_you_want to_try_something_new
excellent_food
naan_was_excellent along_with chicken_tikka_masala
wow wow wow is_all i_can_say
first of_all i_love_the atmosphere
because he_has located his restaurant_in_the midst of_his other_indian oriented stores
it_has_a feeling of attractive authenticity
the_husband is from_the punjab and the_wife is_from hong kong
they_make a marvelous and delightful team
the_food_is the_real star here
the papardams with delicious sauces_were the_starter
then_we had_their chick_pea dish_which was_so light_and flavorful
everything_was obviously fresh
i_then had the_chicken_biryani and_my_wife had_a mixed_vegetable dish and_both_were exquisite
the_naan_bread_was delicious as_well
i_have nothing negative to_write
we_will become regulars as we_have_been looking_for_a_good indian_restaurant without any luck in_the scottsdale area
try_the shiraz red_wine from_india
it goes so well_with_the spicy_food
came_here_for a valentine's dinner with_the hubby
small space but_the food's flavor makes_up_for_it immensely
we_ordered_the kolkata pani puri for_starters
little hollowed out puffed pastries stuffed_with potatoes_and chick_peas
which_you pour tamarind flavored water on
although the_flavors_were there
they_didn't work well together
for the_main_course we_got_the dhaba chicken_curry_with aromatic basmati_rice_and some_garlic_naan
this_dish was_delicious
the_chicken_was boneless and_tender
the_curry_was rich with_spices and heat
the_garlic_naan was_fresh_and pillowy and worked great_with the_curry
the_serving size was_perfect for_two to_share
and_we even_had enough to_take_home
great_atmosphere
they_even had_a guy playing a sitar in the_front of_the_restaurant
this_restaurant_is located_in_the india plaza
next_to a_indian grocery_store
parking seems really scarce though
and make_sure_you make_a_reservation
they_get booked
excellent_food
quick_service too
the chai_tea was_fantastic_and the aromas made my_stomach grumble with anticipation
try_this little_gem
you'll be_very glad you did
visited this_place along_with family
the_quality taste_of food_is_good
can_be better
we_ordered vegetarian curries
the_taste was_good_but it_was_not something we_would crave for
garlic naans were_very_good hot from the_tandoor
the_price_is similar_to other indian_restaurant_in_the town average per_person
ambience was_okay as_they stuffed lot_of artifacts in small_place where_you feel you_are_in very_small room
i may_not recommend_this_place as it_didn't tantalize my_taste_buds
service_is_very good_as_the food_arrived in min and the_lady was courteous
i'm amazed i've_had indian_food_but not_like this amazing flavors i_had_the vegetarian dish and_it makes_me wanna go meatless but service_was_great nice_ambience and we'll worth_the_price big up dhaba
it_was_a super busy night_and so service_was initially a_little_slow
but what's the rush
slow down
enjoy_the experience
mango lassies great
veggie dumplings outstanding
garlic_naan very_good
veggie paneer again
great
rice_pudding delicious
host gracious and kind
go_here if_you_want fantastic veggie indian_food
don't bother ordering tikka_masala like everyone else
try something new
this_is_my_favorite_indian place
make_sure_you are not_in_a rush
let the_environment draw you_in
smell the frangrance of_spices emnating from the_food ordered by others
yiu can pair your_food with_the wines offered
ask_for help
take_your time savoring the_food
i_came_here on a_date
having read good_reviews and knowing friends_who like_it here
and_i_was less than impressed
first_off
i_made reservations
and we_still had_to_wait
we_were right_on time
there_were empty tables
and i_was_a_little confused
after_being sat by_our wholly unenthusiastic hostess slash waitress
we_waited forever_to get_in our_drink order
we perused the huge_menu for quite some_time
thought about getting an_appetizer
but ended up skipping the_app because_we figured we_would be_there all night long if we_did
in retrospect
a smart move
when the_food_came
it_was_pretty_good
but_a_little bland
i'd maybe try different_dishes if there's_a next_time
i could_see people complaining that the_portions_are on_the smaller side
but_i_thought they_were ok
not_great
but okay
minus a star_for the_fact_that our wine never_came until our_food showed up
and i_had_to politely remind our_server
being on a_date
this_really was killer
would_have_been nice_to loosen up convo with_a_nice glass_of_wine
and we_ended_up both getting one glass instead_of two
all in_all
super disappointing
thought_it was_going_to_be a_fun
interesting experience
and looked forward to doing something different
but this_place_is firmly out_of_my
dating restaurants
rotation
maybe i'll come_back with_friends
if we_had_a super_nice waitress who suggested dishes_and treated us well
it could_have been_great
and
it_doesn't have_a very romantic ambiance
we_were so_far apart when sitting at_our
table_for
that_we joked about having convo via carrier pigeon
factor in the_fact_that it's kind of expensive
and yeah
stars all_the_way
you_guys
the_tikka_masala
the_spice
perfection
amazing
weird bathroom sitch
so close_to_the sitting area and_a urinal
bleck
but doesnt matter
food trumps any building logistics
i_had_an excellent experience_with my_friend here_a_couple weeks_ago
caution
the_menu_is huge
i_don't_even know_what_i ordered
i_kept asking the_waitress and_then was_like sure
i_do know we_had_the appetizer sampler
again no_idea what_it_was
but ooooh so_yummy
my_friend got chicken_tikka_masala with_no heat
but_it_was_still really_good
i_got_a seven and_by then end_of_the night_i felt_the burn
the_mango_lassi were soothing and_delicious
plus we_got_a discount from google
so_we_were happy
but_we forgot our leftovers i_was_so sad
definitely_recommend_this_place
a_little_pricey but great_food
bonus point for_the white guy playing the sitar in_an otherwise totally indian staff
this_place_is delicious
i_ordered way too_much_food
and_the_portions_are huge
low the_tikka garlic_naan cauliflower that_was spicy
also loved the_owners
so sweet
this_was delish
and_i_love that_they_had clear marking on what_was vegan on_the_menu
we_asked_for out_of spicy
and it_was_still pretty mild for_me
the_cauliflower had the_most kick
but_not overwhelming
next_time_i_will try or
and_there will_definitely be_a next_time
it's_hard_to believe_that there's a_special place_like this in_tempe
not_impressed at_all
i_didn't_like the_taste_of the_food_and i_didn't_think the_service_was_good at_all
i_won't_be going back_here for_sure
i_also thought_it_was over_priced for_what they_offered
i_wouldn't recommend_this_place_to my_family_and friends
but_i know alot_of people who find it_to_be fine
personally i_just didn't_like it_though
i've_been_here a_few_times_and always enjoy each visit
first of_all
when_you_walk in you_get an inviting feeling from_the smiles and courteousness of_the_staff
you_get_to experience a_bit_of the culture with_the lovely dining set they_have and_by the_look of the_decor
and_of_course
the_many flavorful dishes_that they_offer
their staff pays attention_to the_water level_of your cup and ensures it_is filled
that's an_a
this time_around i_tried papadum which_is_a starter
it_looks_like a tortilla but the_texture is_a light tortilla chip made_of lentil powder
rice powder and_some different spices
you_can practically eat these non stop
favorites chicken tandoors bread dessert
rahon dal tarka which_is yellow lentils mixed_with different herbs and_spices
you_can_eat this with_their saffron cumin rice
gudaspuri mutter_paneer which_is blended mix_of peas_and cheese along_with the_dhaba herbs and_spices
great_for trying_to fulfill the_veggie part_of your daily food intake
palak_paneer
spinach_and cheese
is also_good
gazab ka kadahi murgh which_is_a bbq boneless chicken marinated_in a_spicy yogurt
this is_my_new favorite_dish because_it's baked in_their clay_oven
once cooked then its marinated_in the yogurt_sauce and mixed with_onions
bell peppers_and tomato to create a_wonderful sauce
tandoori murgh
chicken
cooked in_the clay_oven paired with_onions and_a squeeze of lemon
pani puri which_is small finger foods
street_food
little chip like texture cups filled_with potatoes_and chick_peas
pour the_mint water in_the filled cups and add an optional taramind sauce or mint sauce
garlic_naan is_hands_down my_favorite garlic_naan i_have_tasted
if you're wanting garlic_naan then come_here to_eat_it
it's soft
airy
fluffy with the_right_amount_of crispness on_the edges and amount of_garlic shavings on top
ras malai
sweet condensed milk cheese circular chunks
homemade dessert
think_of fresh mozzarella cheese texture
really soft clean texture mixed in with_the condensed milk cream_sauce
halwa which_is_a carrot fudge
sweet cooked carrot shavings boiled in condensed milk mixed_with hints of pistachios
cashews
and golden raisins
really innovative for_a homemade dessert
overall_i loved_this_place because_i can always select new_dishes as_well as favorite_dishes to_eat and_i_can always expect great friendly_service from_their staff
gotta come check_this_place out
mmm mmm gooddd
only_thing_i regret was_not taking pics of_the delicious foods
next_time
i've_eaten lots_of curry throughout my_life
this curry_was just_okay
the_menu_is massive and offers a_lot_of variety
for_someone unfamiliar with the_cuisine it's_quite daunting
since_i_was trying_out this_restaurant for_the_first_time i_decided_to_try something i_was_very familiar_with and ordered_a shrimp masala
the_dish_was seasoned heavily
like_any indian_dish should be
but the_flavors didn't_really seem_to balance out very_well
all_of_the seasonings tasted a_bit off
and were_a_bit overbearing in_a funny tasting way
but alas
not_bad by_any_means of_the imagination
i cleaned off_the plate_and would try_it_again
the_shrimp itself_was wonderful
very_fresh_and well_cooked
the_garlic_naan was_to_die_for
it was_one_of_the_best naans i've ever_had
cooked_to_perfection
judging from other_reviews
i'm_not sure_if we_just came_in on an_off night or what
but_the_service_was not_good at_all
we_were probably sitting for minutes_before someone came_over_and took_our drink_orders
and_this_was not_on a_busy night
our_server didn't seem particularly happy_to be_there
the_food_took a_little while to_come_out
but_i expect that when_ordering more elaborate meals
and_was not_at_all turned off_by this
the_restaurant_has_a little side shop
which sells british and_indian goodies
which_was delightful
a_definite plus
best_indian in_all_of phoenix
loved_the atmosphere and_the_food very_much
i_would_definitely come_back_and i_would_say makes_it in to_my top indian_restaurants_in phoenix
definitely high up_there in_terms of_the cute atmosphere
can't_wait to_come_back_and go_to_the little market next door
great_food but_very expensive
several nearby places offer same quality at lower price
nice_place inside
food prices range from appetizers to entrees
flying horse large beer
food_was
atmosphere
young couples
music play some music for god sake
overall
if they_had music and_some free papad to_start_with
i_would of given them
still
buy the_groupon and go_during the_week
outstanding flavor
spicy_as a bastard
and_good beer_and_wine
a_bit_pricey for_sure
but worth_it occasionally
the adjacent indian store is cool but even_more overpriced
update to_my post
i set_the dollar value at but_that_was with_my groupon
the_value is_a_bit higher than_that if_you_have an_appetizer
entrees
desert and_wine as_our groupin did
still excellent_food
excellent
excellent
excellent
i_was_here for my_first_time last_night with some_friends for_dinner_and we_were_all very_satisfied
wondeful service_and a_great_selection to_choose_from
i_will most definitely be_back
this_place_is a_hidden_gem
we_were_there_for restaurant week
the food_was_outstanding as_was_the service
the_staff_were_very nice and_pleasant as_well as attentive
i_cannot recall the_names_of the_food we_ordered but_it_was the_best_indian_food_i_have ever_tasted
i_highly_recommend_this_place
we_will_be_back
don't_forget to_check_out_the market that is_located to_the eastern part_of_the dining_room
the_chai was_also very_tasty_and delicious
as an_indian
five_stars was_out_of reach anyway
the food_was_decent
not bad_for arizona indian_food
we_enjoyed the_paneer makhni
lamb_vindaloo_and chicken_curry
the naan_was_also very_nice
i_tried some chaat
street_food in_india that_is typically flavorful_and delicious
and_it_was border line inedible
we_requested extra_spicy and_it_was bland_and likely had been_sitting for_a_while
i_never understand why chaat is_so difficult_to find in_phoenix and_this_was pretty disappointing
i_would also say that_it_was expensive
a_decent indian_buffet is often a_better value_and larger food_coma
this_restaurant_is the_only_place i_go for_indian_food
oh_my goodness
the_staff_is so_nice and_the_food gives me random cravings almost everyday haha
i_recommend_the chicken_tikka_masala at_a number or hotness level
mmmmm
it's_a_little place that_makes a date_night very intimate or a_lunch with_a_friend very personable
i_had two friends that_had never_tried_indian_food before so_i took them here and_they_were in shock haha
definiately a great_place_to_go
if_you_are going friday or saturday_night make_a_reservation
there_are a_lot_of other_people who_have the_same opinion as me
oh_and most plates are around so a_little up_there but_definitely worth_it
we_went_on_a weekday afternoon at around_pm
it_was fairly empty
the_food_was_a mazing
we_had different tikka masalas with_basmati_rice
perfect rendering
i_tried_the gluten_free
vegan roti
and_it_was yummy
especially_with the plum sauce we_got with_the gulshan e bazar
which_were also gluten_free
vegan
and_delicious
as_someone who can't eat gluten or eggs
and shouldn't eat dairy either
really
i_was amazed that_i_could have_a satisfying
allergen free meal that was_super delicious
and_the_service_was very_friendly_and very
very_helpful
it's a_huge plus that_their menus are marked for gf
veg
vegan
though dairy and eggs separated would_be nice
the_dhaba_is my go_to_indian good_place
i_love_it
it_is the_best_indian_food_i've_had in_the_valley
it's_very small_and i_recommend making a_reservation in_advance to_be safe
on occasion they_do put_out a_groupon that_is insane
foods i_recommend
chai_tea
free refills
chicken_tikka_masala
paneer_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo
garlic_naan
raita
we_had_some friends coming over from ri who_were craving_for authentic indian_cuisine_and so based_on_the yelp_reviews we_took them to_the_dhaba
and we_were_not_disappointed
the_ambiance_is very acceptable
they've managed_to recreate a mildly indian atmosphere in_there
we_went along_with our vegetarian friends_and stuck to a_veggie diet
the bhel_puri wasn't_that great
however the_samosa chat more_than made_up_for_it
the_garlic_naan as many_of_the other_reviews point_out
was_simply surreal
the_same could_be said of the_paneer tikka_masala_and_the kofta
the_food_was_really_good
now
for_the put offs
with just_one other_table occupied in_the_restaurant and us having given our_orders in_advance
it_took good minutes for_the_food_to arrive
and_that too
after_the other_table was_served
the_lovely young lady who welcomed us
showed us_our seats and_took our_orders had_a terrible scowl writ all_over her face
she never once did smile
was_very curt and generally had_the air of someone who_was waiting on a_bunch_of people who_had invaded her house
uninvited
despite the_food_and_the ambiance and_the_wait time
the one_thing which we_all kept going_back_to weeks after our_visit to_the_dhaba
was how dispirited and unwelcoming the_lady was
bottom_line verdict
good_food
good ambiance
not_really welcoming
their butter_chicken_is good
the_atmosphere_is really_nice
incredible
that pretty much says it
the service_and_food were spot_on
easily the_best_indian_food
no
food
that i_have_ever_had
i_would_say it_is_the_best restaurant i_have_ever eaten_at
including
high end
restaurants that_are easily two to three_times the_price
officially my_favorite_restaurant
ever
they_have_a total respect for_people and_food
can't_wait_to try_more vegan_dishes
visiting phoenix from dc
was_hoping to_find delicious_indian_food like_we get_in dc
dhaba definitely delivered
enjoyed all_the_dishes
especially the_lamb_vindaloo_and the_palak_paneer
so_glad we_came
this_is our st time dinning at_the_dhaba
we_loved the_ambiance and_the_decor of_the_place
the_server hostess was_very_nice_and the_food_was_amazing
we_had_the garlic_naan
lamb soup
chicken mango curry
chicken_and_lamb curry
the_basmati_rice and_garlic_naan_were out_if this_world
the_meats were_all tender_and tasty
we_also_had chai_tea and_rice_pudding and_they_were pretty_good
the_only down side is_that_the service_was_a_little slow but we_will_definitely come_back
the_portions_are very_good_and filling
the place_was_pretty empty for_a friday lunch but_everything was_very_good so no_complaints
i_loved_the spicy vindaloo_and_the pangang evened everything out
the lemonade was_spicy_and refreshing
just wonderful
the_best_indian_food_i_have ever_had
the_service_is_always amazing
i_come_here on_a monthly basis and it_is_always consistant
when_we crave traditional indian_food
we come_here
tasty yet overpriced
except at_lunch
also carefully look_at your bill
they hide the_fact_that they add gratuity for themselves by making_it look_like part_of_the total amount you_must pay
not_an itemized suggested amount
pros
great_variety with_a_lot_of dishes
good_lunch prices
tasty dishes no matter_what you_order
beautiful ambience
cons
dinner prices_are higher than most_indian_places
some staff can_be truculent if you_do or ask_for anything_that apparently isn't to_her liking
deceitful w bills
as mentioned above
they print very archaic looking bills w only numbers so you_must remember exactly what_you ordered_and what_it cost
but read it carefully
it_is itemized first by food drink
then food drink tax
then food drink tax tip
so it's_easy_to assume the_number at the_bottom is_your total without tip
which leads most_people to double tip them unknowingly
i've seen my coworkers miss this every_time
makes_me really wonder if_they aren't intentionally making their bills cryptic and confusing
my_husband_and_i had_a_very enjoyable lunch
the_restaurant_is clean_and pleasantly decorated
every_dish we_had was_delicious_and_the owners were lovely
thank_you
i bought a_groupon to_the_dhaba
and_my fiance and_i used it a_few_weeks_ago
it was_really_nice
i_liked_the decor
the_place_is a_bit smaller than_i_expected
but_very cute
i_had_the chicken_tikka_masala_and it_was_excellent
spiced just_right for_me
i_asked_for it at_a
my fiance had sag lamb
and_he liked his as_well
i_had garlic_naan
it_was_a_little dryer than i_like
but_still pretty_good
we_went next_door_to the_shop and_it_was_pretty cool to_look around
we_will_be_back
really
i_tried dhaba for_the_first_time today
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala which_was_good and_garlic_naan which_was ok
they deliver so_that's always a_plus for_me
i'm looking_forward_to trying some_other things
i_went_there this weekend
though the_place_is smaller and_there_is only_one common washroom
ughh
we really_enjoyed_the_food
we_had tandoori_chicken
naan
kadai chicken and_mango_lassi
but i_must_say the_price_is a_bit high than other_places
so_good
had the_special salad with corn cilantro tomato onion_and rice crisps
the_chicken_curry_and garlic_naan
so fire trucking good
not_bad at_all
the food_is_tasty
portions_are large_and prices_are_reasonable
avoid the khus shurbat drink
though_it simply tastes_like sprite
which_is_what they_said they_made it_from
masala bay is decent_indian fair
the_food_is_great and_the terrace is_a_good as it_gets in waterloo
i_love the_fact_that if_you_want spicy
you
ll get spicy
i_just_wish the_portions_were smaller and cheaper
i_like_to order multiple plates with my_friends_and share among_the group
its my_personal preference not_to be_served a heaping bowl of_food_and stuff my face
decent_indian_food in_the_area
parking can_be_a_bit tricky and when_it's raining
you_may have_some trouble walking_in the entryway
that_said
we thoroughly_enjoyed our_meal here
chicken_tikka_masala
butter_chicken
naan
and_rice filled us up just_enough
the_prices seemed_a_little high_for what_we_got
other_than_that
i'd probably stop_in here_again if_i_were in_the_area_and craving_indian_food
definitely my_favourite place_in waterloo
i've tried a_couple_of indian_places nearby and keep_coming back
many_of_the staples of_indian comfort_food are done very_well
the_menu marks the_spiciness_of a given dish very_well and_i've never been surprised_by either how hot or bland a_dish was_given the_spice marking
the_portions_are very large_and conducive to sharing with_a_friend of partner
i've never_been_to their_lunch_buffet but their_prices can_be_a big high at_dinner
regardless
i consider it a_welcome premium for the_quality_of_the_food
they also_do take_out_and it_is_great to_take such good_food home
the_portions_are large enough that_you_can probably make two meals out_of it
unassuming exterior
but_with well_decorated indian themed interior
heavy
solid metal menus are part_of_the distinctive character
extensive food_options
and_the_place has_been full_of patrons the_two times_i've been_there
recommend
i_love_this restaurant
definitely the_best_indian_restaurant_in waterloo
the_decor_is_very nice_inside
for_dinner
they dim the lights and bring_out the candles so it_has_a very romantic feel
in_the summer time
they_will open up_a patio which_is a_bit_more casual if_you_want_to go with_a_couple_of friends
the_first_time_i went
i_went_with friends_and we_were_all dressed in very casual clothing
it_was_a_little awkward since_we_were having dinner
and_there_were candles and_everyone around us_was dressed up_and on a_date or with_their families
we_didn't know
the_service_is_good
but sometimes it_seems they_are understaffed and_take a_while_to bring_you something like more water
overall
the_wait_staff_is helpful with the_menu_and friendly
the_food_is_great
the butter_chicken_is very_tasty_and the_naan_is made very_well
they_also bring_out some complimentary crispy rolls
and_sauces for_you to_dip them in and_they taste amazing
the_best value is_to go_during lunch_time
for_lunch
they_only have_a_buffet
the_one time_i_went
they_had fruit
butter_chicken
naan
a type_of goat_curry
chicken_tandoori
potatoes
some beans veggies dishes
dessert_and ice_cream
great_value
my_only_complaint_is parking
masala bay is_located next_to a hotel
and_there_is_a private lot but_i_guess the_hotel claims all the_parking spots there since_there are signs everywhere that state parking_is reserved for hotel guests only
consequently
you_will_have to park on the_street and_walk about_to minutes
depending on_the time of_the_day
one last note there_is_a picture on_the_wall of stephen hawking at_the_restaurant
neat
masala bay has good_indian_food
the_two times_i've gone
i_have_been with_a_group_of people_and we_have shared dishes
family_style
so
i'm_not always sure_what i_ate
but
it_was_all good
some_of_the things_that stood out_to me_were
the_garlic_naan_and the_vindaloo
it_is_very spicy even to_this southern so watch out
as the_previous reviewer pointed out
it_is_a small_restaurant with_what can_be difficult parking
the_second_time we parked in_a free parking_lot just past the_restaurant which_was_nice
and_they can_be understaffed
but
the_food_is_good
the_beer is_good_and the_atmosphere_is_nice
i will_certainly go_back if_i find myself in w town
i_came_here_with such high expectations after having read quite a_few positive_reviews
we_ordered off_the_menu for an_early dinner
the_mango_lassi was_quite_good
the biriyani rice_was dried out_and crunchy probably leftover rice from their_lunch_buffet
the chicken_in_the curry tasted as though_it_was a_few_days old
the_lamb in_the biriyani had too_much fat left on_it and_made the_whole dish taste too greasy
the d_cor inside suits the_indian theme of_the_restaurant
this_is_definitely not_the_best place_in kw for authentic_indian_food
their weekday lunch_buffet_is_a steal not a_deal
food_is_delicious and_they_offer dishes_that are actually spicy
terrible to average food_quality
slow_service
dim ambience_and expensive
probably still in business because_of lack_of serious competition in kw
most_indian_restaurants in kw are_pretty bad
communal pots of_sauce are taken from table_to table
drying out_and picking_up germs as_they go
unhealthy and unappetizing
and_it_is revolting to_see other people's crumbs in
your
sauce
i'm_not_a germphobe but i_found_this to_be_a foul practice
i_never saw the_sauces refilled or the_sauce plates taken away to_be cleaned
the_curries_are lacking sloppily presented and_tasted of stale spices
the_only_reason this_place gets even two_stars is_that_the samosas_are still okay and_the_tandoori is_decent
our shrimp appetizer came_with_the nasty table sauce_and cost for_four small fried shrimp
on_the_menu they allegedly have_some special sauce
but it's_just the_little table sauces_and nothing_special
wine_list is short
and mark ups are massive
the outdoor tables should be a_nice place_to_eat in_the summer but the_plastic tablecloths are tacky and dirty
our_waiter_was rude_and awkward
he nearly threw the_food_on_the table_and interrupted our conversation
i_mentioned it_to_the hostess
she said_he usually works in_the_kitchen and_has_a condition that makes_it difficult for_him to_work with customers
this_is unfortunate
but i'm_still paying pretty high prices_and part_of that_is service
perhaps they_should hire another waiter if_they_are lacking_in staff
it's a_shame
because_we used_to love_this_place
it used_to_be_a cozy upscale indian treat and_now it's_just messy and lazy
they_are_very lucky that there's little in_the way_of competition in k w
because this_place wouldn't last a_week in toronto
we_took out_of_town guests to masala bay more_than once_and enjoyed_it
but_this last experience_was a_total turnoff
we will_not_be_returning
i_have_tried both there lunch_buffet_and a_la_carte dinner
if you arent that hungry you_will_not_be_disappointed with there a_la_carte dinner even_though_it might_be_a little_pricey but well_worth_it
if_you_are hungry then you_should try there buffet as_they have_a_lot_of varieties_of food even for_vegetarians
you_can notice the_quality difference from_the_buffet to a_la_carte but the_buffet_is still awesome
my_husband_and_i ate_at curry_leaf last_night_and were very_pleased
this_place_is family_owned
has_been open about three months_and is_located in_a_strip_mall near a basha's
the_place_is small_and sparsley decorated
but i_came_to eat not look_at stuff on_the_wall
the service_was_very_friendly and_prompt
both my_husband_and_i ordered_chicken curry_dishes with chapathi which_is_a whole_wheat flour flat_bread
the_food_was very_tasty_and flavorful
i_was getting full
but could_not stop_eating as i_found_it that_good
as_we finished_eating one_of_the_owners came out and_we talked with him for_a_while
he explained how_they prepare the_food_and their goal is_for fresh_and healthy food
the_wife prepares and cooks all_of_the_food and_the husband_and daughter help out in_front
i'm definitley a_fan and intended to_go_back soon as_the_food was_delicious_and_the owners are_very_friendly
total sux ass
what a_disappointment
we_found out_that a_new_indian place openning up near by_and wanted_to_go check_it_out
came once_and they_were_closed
came again_and they_were_closed
but finally today we_found place open
ordered_some stuff
got_some boxes took them home
its really not_an eat_in kinda place unless_you like dinky tables_and walmart plastic chairs
ohh boy
ohh boy
ohh wait
rice
wtf
its just a_bowl_of rice_with some very_little
stuff
on_top_of it
wow are those vegetables from frozen pack
cuz it sure looks like_it
tastes_like it_too
so
i_just paid bux for small bowls_of rice_with some questionable chicken and_some frozen veggies that tasted like fast_food indian
damn i_feel violated
i_highly enjoy this_place_and my_husband and_i_have_been back many_times since our_first_visit
i very_much enjoy_the_food and the_owners_are so_friendly and_really go_out_of their way to_make_sure you_have a_good_experience
i understand everyone_is entitled to_their opinion
so for_those that did_not enjoy this_place your opinion is valid
but_i_don't understand how you_had such_a horrible experience
i_also don't understand why the_reviews had_to_be so nit pickey
for_the reviewer that nit picked about_the tables_and chairs
big_deal
shouldn't you focus on the_food_and not the_decor
i_know i_go_to a_restaurant for_food not decor
i_think_the same reviewer remarked that the_veggies are frozen
quiet the_opposite
the_owners pride themselves on_the freshness of their_food
having spoken to the_owners i_think_they know_how_to run a business_and if more_people give_them_a chance i_think_they will suceed and_they_are listening to these yelp_reviews and taking what_we say about_them into consideration
which_is more_than i_can_say for_most restaurant owners in_this town who don't seem_to care a_whole lot what their patrons say
i_know not everyone will_have the_same experience
but i_can_say_that i_like this_place_and it's_just too_bad the_other_reviewers didn't enjoy what curry_leaf has_to_offer
yes
we understand
the_owners_are friendly
i too like the_owners
they_are_a sweet couple
now regarding the_actual place itself
skip it
it's amateur food_and_i mean that sincerely and_not as_an insult
the_person preparing the_food_is_not a chef or_a professional cook by_any_means
it_just sees as_if some random auntie and uncle decided_to lease a space and start cooking fast_food versions of_indian_food thinking
these dumb americans have_no clue
we_will call it chicken tikha masala wrap and they_will think_it's cool
i'm indian and_i_had_a hunch this_place_was like_that but_i_was bored and_decided_to pay them a_visit and try_this authentic_food
after_all
if the_food_is_great
then_i could care less if_it's faux indian_food
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
bowl
i_asked them if they_could add some sauce to_it and_the_owner responded
yes
many customers have_asked me_to do_that so_we started_to do_that
first of_all
chicken_tikka_masala without sauce_is like eating chicken soup without water
it_doesn't exist
and_what makes this story even_more odd is_that when i_got_the_chicken with_the supposed added sauce
it_was_still dry
it_had literally one teaspoon worth of_sauce over some very_dry and poorly cooked rice
and_i paid bucks for_that
needless to_say_i didn't go_back
look
i'm_not insulting your intelligence
i_know you_have eaten_indian_food at_an actual sit down indian_restaurant_and that_this_is supposed to_be_good in it's own manner as_a pseudo fast_food version_of indian
hey
fast_food indian
love the_concept
i'm down_with that
unfortunately
it's already being done in bigger cities and_it's much better
even fast_food indian has more_flavor than this_place
furthermore
they_are slow
you_don't walk up
pay bucks and walk_away with chicken_tikka wraps minutes later
you_walk up
pay bucks and wait minutes_for one auntie to microwave your_food in_the_back
it's interesting seeing some_of_the reviews_on here
you_would think curry_leaf was trying_to present itself as_an upscale indian_food_restaurant in_a hugely desirable area
curry_leaf shares a_strip_mall with_a dry cleaners
taco bell
az hair co and chuck e cheese
it's_a_small place_with tables to_eat_in
but_i imagine most_of_their business is takeout or_the newly available delivery
jeff p mentions
it_just sees as_if some random auntie and uncle decided_to lease a space and start cooking fast_food versions of_indian_food
first of_all
i disagree with_this
and second
isn't america founded on_the entrepreneurial spirit that promotes local owned businesses
curry_leaf is owned by_a husband wife duo and_i_was super stoked at_how nice the_husband was
he answered my questions without prejudice which_is rare for_me in other_indian establishments
while_i waited_for my_food
we chatted about_their business
my business and_other random chit chat
as_i_was leaving
another gentleman came_in and the_husband sang out
hey bob
how are_you doing today
it's_nice to_see_that customer_service and appreciation are_still alive these days
i_ordered_the channa_masala bowl with_basmati_rice and_a_side_of cumin potatoes_and i_was_really impressed
the_flavor in both_dishes was_great_and had just_a_little tinge of spicyness
the_portions_were great_and for_the_price of
i_think an_excellent value
lunch price_is
regularly
there_are also a_couple_of really neat things_that make this_place stand_out
they_offer deliver and text in service
so_you_can actually text them your_order for pickup
i_think_that is such_a cool idea
you_are texting directly to_the husbands phone
and then_he saves your number so_that in_the_future he knows that_its you
i'm pretty_sure he remembers every customer
the bowls that they_use for_takeout are_very durable and can_be used again as tupperware
i_think this_is_a super cool idea and adds a_little value
in_a world where_we are cattle prodded through life eating out_of styrofoam containers in_our cars
i_believe curry_leaf has made an attempt to_add value to_their product and_i for_one am both impressed and inspired and look_forward_to a_new weekly lunch spot
with regard to amber w
's points
i'm rating the_food not_the containers or the_owners
if_it makes_you feel better eating subpar food because_of_the american spirit so_be it
others of_us are_more concerned with the_food_itself
i'm_not downgrading it_because it's_not_a sit down restaurant
even among non sit down restaurants or
fast_food
style_indian themed eateries
this_place_is subpar
i've_eaten at quick indian eateries and_they_are much better_than this
my review_is_for people who understand and_can appreciate good_indian_food
it's_not for_people who value text service
nice containers and chatty owners
i_want_to support mom_and_pop and locally owned restaurants but_i also want_to support good ones and_not encourage bad ones to emerge simply because_there is_no competition for_indian themed restaurants here
am a_big indian_food connoisseur
i_am always on_the hunt for_indian_food in_phoenix and_it_is too disappointing that_no restaurants so_far has met my_expectations
unlike seattle
where my_brother lives
good quality_indian_food is_hard_to come_by here in_phoenix
i_have read_the_reviews on_yelp_and none_of it seem_to_have presented the_good and the_bad that_can provide a feedback to_the people running this business
with_that in_mind
i_want_to visit this_restaurant_and will_be posting an opinion soon so other yelpers can_get_a good input
i_have_never_had a nicer
happier or friendlier server in_my_life
the man was_a pure delight
so its somewhat painful to_do this
but dont come for_the_lunch_buffet
bland crap bland
the_highlight is the_starter
which they_serve you before allowing you to_go_to_the buffet
we_actually got_up to_hit the shit out_of the_buffet_but were told_that we_had_to_wait til we_were_served the apps
all_good
on_the_buffet the_best were_the condiments
the_worst would_have to_be_the food
not_good
there_is_a much better indian_lunch_buffet around_the_corner that_i_will suss out_and up star
suruchi is_a friendly
and serious indian_restaurant with_some fun scottish twists on_their_menu
i_came_here on my_first night in_edinburgh in_search_of vegetarian fare two_other veggie places right down_the_street didn't pan out_for various reasons
and indian_food is_always_a safe bet
i_had_an excellent kafta makahi dish
and_when ordered with the_spice_level
as you_would have_it
please i_like spicy foods
i_was_not dissatisfied
it_was perfectly spicy without being overwhelming
and the_flavor_was excellent all_around
service_was_quick and_pleasant
and the_cook checked to_see_how everything_was
price paid_for a main_dish
drink
irn bru
and_garlic nann was
if you're looking_for great_indian_food at_a reasonable_price
and_or a_wide_selection of_vegetarian_options
including veggie haggis fritters
what
then give suruchi a_shot
i_ate lunch_here today
and_i actually couldn't wait to_get home_and review it
whether you see_that as_an indication of how_good this_place_is
or of_how sad i_am is up_to you
but you_should definitely eat_there before_you decide
we_went_for their course lunch deal_for
as_we just happened_to be walking past and_were given_a flyer
we_did_not regret_it
although_i am now extremely full
i_usually steer clear of_indian_restaurants as_i often find_the food_can be_very greasy_and stodgy
and_very often it_all tastes the_same
none_of that is_true about_this_place
the_starter is automatically brought_to you
you don't_get to_choose it yourself
although the_waiter did ask_us if_we_were vegetarians first
he_brought us thinly sliced potatoes which_had been fried in a_lovely combination_of spices until crispy
although i'm not_going_to pretend for a_second that i_know_what they_were
alongside these we each got a_huge chunk of_tandoori grilled chicken_and an equally massive chunk of_chicken marinated_in their own unique spice blend
with_a_side salad_and home_made raita
i'm not_sure if_it_was the_selection_of mains or my boyfriend's almond and saffron lassi which_was the ultimate winner
but the_mains definitely played a_huge part in_it
there_was_a buffet_with different curry_dishes a tadka dal
a tandoori lamb_curry
a_veggie sweet potato spinach_curry and_the_best one_of all
chicken_cooked with cashew nut paste
roast tomatoes
garlic_and green chillies
oh
yes
of_course
this all came_with an unlimited supply of green salad
home_made mango_chutney
flavours of home_made poppadums and as_much home_made naan_bread as you_can_eat
as_for_the lassi
you_need to_go_and try_that for_yourself at
it's_an absolute steal
the_best_thing about all this_was_the bill
for two_of_us to_eat more_than
in_all probability
was healthy for_that time of_the_day
a lassi
a_beer and large bottle_of mineral water we_paid just
if_you_like_indian_food
or_even think_you might do but you're still not_sure
i_can't recommend_this_place highly enough
if_you_are ever in_the_mood for_a decent_indian meal
suruchi is_the_place_to_go
situated in_the centre of_the busy_and bustling nicolson street
suruchi is_just around_the_corner from the_main university campus
george square and_is a_short walk_from the_city centre and_so it_is_a convenient place_to reach
the_restaurant looks pretty_small from the_outside
but inside it stretches back quite far and_is able to_accommodate a_lot_of customers
suruchi's menu offers_a wide_selection_of authentic indian_cuisine and_i_ordered_the seafood soup to_start which_was truly amazing made_with really fresh_ingredients and_tasted super fresh yummy
i_then had the_butter_chicken for my_main which_was equally as amazing and_the_chicken_was cooked_perfectly and_there_was no excess layer of oil on_the sauce_which i sometimes find with indian_dishes
there_are warnings on_the_menu indicating which dishes_are mild_and which_are hot which always gets a_big thumbs_up from_me as_you won't get_your head blown off_by an unexpected chili
the_prices_are really reasonable here with_most main meal curry's costing about six pounds
and_there_is_a lunch deal available too where a two course meal costs what_a bargain
suruchi is_a really great_indian_restaurant serving beautiful food and_it_is definitely worth_a_visit
some friends_and_i came across suruchi after an exam in_the nearby adam house
we_were_all starving
tired and_just fancied relaxing with_a tasty meal
thankfully we_found_this_place which offers great_service_and delicious
authentic_indian_food at_reasonable_prices
the_restaurant isn't the_biggest and it_has_a really_friendly
chilled out atmosphere with clean
neatly laid out tables
the_staff_are all pleasant_and they_seem_to take no_time to_get_your food_out the_kitchen
i_had_the butter_chicken with boiled rice_and_a naan_bread which cost only about
it_tasted amazing when_it arrived and_we_all agreed that we'd come_here again any day
the flyers say this_restaurant offers true taste_of_india
and_if thats true im going_to_have to_put it_out there_and say i_don't_like the taste_of_india
i_was_really disappointed_with the_food_here and_i wasn't the_only_one
my korma was_kind_of watery_and way_too sweet and_the_other curries my_friends had were equally lack lustre
maybe i_went_there on a_bad day
the_other_reviews here_are really_good
the_staff_were lovely_and the_restaurant_itself was_really_nice so_it could_be worth going_back_for the_two course lunch_buffet they_offer for
to_give_them another try
i_think_i might_have to give_this_place another_chance i_will provide my_experience here
but i_can't_say if this_is_the norm
basically
i_arrived before the_rest_of my_fellow diners
i_didn't_know if_there would_be four_of five people_in total
which apparently wasn't useful to the_staff member
who instead_of giving me a_table which could potentially seat five
made_me sit by the_door until everyone else arrived
it_took_a while for our_waiter to_take_our orders
and_when_we finally received our_food
i_was_not particularly impressed_with what arrived
especially considering the_prices
i_ordered_the navratan kofta
and pretty_sure i_got_the palak kofta makhani instead
by_the_time we_got_our food
though
i_was too hungry to send it_back
the dumplings were absurdly salty
to_the_point where_i almost couldn't eat them
on_the_other_hand
my_dining companions seemed_to enjoy their_dishes
including some tandoori shrimp
after_we finished_eating
we_wanted_to order some desserts
but_after waiting over minutes to_have our_plates cleared
and_even then we_had_to hail a_waiter down_to do_that
we_didn't have enough time
and_just left
i_think_i'll stick_with the_red fort around_the_corner from_here
been just_the once but was_very_impressed
the_restaurant_itself_is a_little shabby around_the edges but the_food_was_delicious
would_definitely go_again
exceptional indian_food
good_service
proportions just_right
good_variety_of starter
nans
seafood
chicken_and_lamb
disappointing the_only gin was gordon's
wanted bombay saphire
exceptional indian_food
fair price
good proportions
good_service
delicious sea food
chicken
lamb_dishes and sppetizers
only disappointment is they_only_had gordon's gin
wanted beefeaters or bombay saphire
highly_recommended
you_know how curry_houses can_be oddly stressful in communicating your_order and such
this_place isn't like_that
the_food got good_reviews from everyone at_the_table and we_were_all happy_with_the service_and overall experience
the jalfrezi sauce is_some_of the_best_i've_ever_had
everything_was consistently good
not_the_best_indian overall that_i've ever_had
but i'm_really glad we_stopped_in
we_were a_group_of six and_they accommodated us without any trouble or eye rolling
reasonably_priced_and delicious
it_was during_the fringe
as_well
so_the ability_to handle a bigger group was impressive
truly excellent_food
great_service
an institution
average indian_restaurant
i_have both eaten_here and_had home delivery
and the_food_and_service are_both fine
most recently i_had_a goats cheese dish_and lamb kadai with garlic_nan
the curry_dishes should_have been hot_and spicy
they_were medium hot i_think_this is another_indian_restaurant where they_are afraid of making their_dishes too_hot probably because the_average british palate cant handle it_though i'm make assumptions here
price wise its fine also
i_was including tip i_can_get cheaper closer_to home
and_of similar quality
i_know indian_and pakistani people who said this used_to_be_a good_indian
so_maybe they_have changed ownership
or_just taken their foot off_the gas
while_i_was in_edinburgh
i_decided_to do a_curry tour to_hit a_new_indian joint every night in_search_of the_most flavorful_and spiciest_curry
see
i_eat spicy_food like most_people breathe air
back_home
i_get indian_take away_and add both habaneros and ghost pepper hot_sauce before_i eat
so
you_know
use that as_a frame of reference
anyway
this_was an elegant and classy looking restaurant_that had_a laid back and_accommodating staff
the_prices here were comparable to_many in_the_area but higher than a_few gems that i_found
even so
it_was_a quiet_and intimate environment
and the_food_was_great
the_flavor_of the_vindaloo_was excellent
it_wasn't
however
very spicy_at_all
at least to_me
i_had_to request they_bring me something_to spice up the_dish more
when_i did
though
they brought_me a_huge dish_of pure chile pepper sauce_that after mixing with_my vindaloo did make the_dish at least moderately spicy
that made_me happy
so
nowhere near_the spiciest_curry in_edinburgh but a_good restaurant_that takes care_of its customers
and definitely_a staff that knows how to_make_a proper tasting vindaloo
i'd visit_again next_time i'm in_the_city
mezbaan often seem_to be left out_of favourite curry restaurant lists
it often seems_to escape the limelight
this_is undeserved
mezbaan is an_indian_restaurant specialising in south_indian_cuisine
every curry_dish i_have_had hear is scrumptious
i_have heard one_person complaining that the_curry wasn't authentic south_indian
i can't_really comment on_this
but_i_can give_the taste_and presentation a thumbs_up
and for_me that's_what a mattered
prices_are_pretty reasonable
i_ate_here with_a_friend
with_two courses and_it cost us around
also note that_its byob
this shouldn't be a_problem as_being near tollcross there_are several supermarkets
and actually a_small grocers right_next door
mezbaan is_a sensational restaurant
serving authentic south_indian_cuisine
situated in_the tollcross area_of edinburgh
mezbaan is_just_a short walk_from the_city centre and_so it_is_a convenient place_to reach
and_with the_outside of_the_restaurant painted a_lovely bright maroon colour
it_would_be difficult_to miss it
the mezbaan menu offers_a vast range_of authentic south_indian_dishes such_as kebabs and dosa's
rich pancakes served_with_a filling
i_came_here for_dinner several months_ago with_a_friend and i_had_an absolutely beautiful meal
i_had_the mixed pakora's for a_starter which were_tasty
but my_main course_of chili beef was_definitely something to_write_home_about
the_beef was cut into_the tiniest slices and_then fried along_with peppers_and onions in_a chili_sauce yum
it_was_a pretty_spicy meal
but_definitely something that_i_would order again
the prices_for the_meals in mezbaan are_quite reasonable considering it_is_in the tollcross area
the starters are priced_at around five pounds and_the main_courses are_more expensive at_about ten to fifteen pounds but_the_food_is definitely worth_it
mezbaan also_do takeaways and home deliveries which_is incredibly handy so they_get a_big thumbs_up from_me
mezbaan has_a slightly upscale atmosphere
a_bit o the pricier side but authentic_and extremely great customer_service
had_the naden adu curry_which_was absolutely_amazing
the_only_downside is the_price
for_a cheaper fix for students i_suggest the kebab_mahal in newington
dosa do or dosa don't
dosa do
blates
haven't a clue what_i'm on about
then go_to mezbaan and_order a_dosa or_two
ok so_you might_not put your faith and dining option based entirely on my_review before knowing what you're_in for
i_went_with_a mixed group_of people
some who_had travelled south_india and hadn't had_a dosa since then
others who hadn't a clue what they_were
i've recently learnt that there's a_big difference between south and north_indian cooking
most
indian_restaurants
you_get here serve north_indian style large curries_and rice
food baby
food_coma
nom but ooft
southern_indian cooking is
first_off
a_lot spicier and secondly they_use a_lot_more bread_and pancake like ingredients rather than rice
such_as dosas
lentil and_rice pancakes
stuffed_with all sorts of_delicious fillings
see uploaded photo
for want of another way to_describe it
think crepes
they're kinda like_that
but_not
and the_ones we_got were considered small
apparently they_can come twice as big
so
they're tasty
really_tasty and_much lighter than the_traditional curry
and_at mezbaan anyway
they're cheap
for a_dosa
with_a_side_of mango_chutney
home_made and_delicious
and_some veg curry
and twice as filling as_a sandwich that_would cost probably a_few quid more
yes please
i_had_the mushroom one that_was nom
everyone else had_a masala_dosa
made_with potato_and there_wasn't_a crumb left
and someone had_the_lamb dosa_which was personally my_favourite
with_some really_fresh
fragrant sweet basil
totally getting that next_time
i also_got to_taste both the_mango_lassi and_the almon and saffron lassi
the almond and saffron lassi came decorated with_little strands of saffron that turned it yellow on top
it_was certainly an acquired taste
as_it wasnt too_sweet
but did the_perfect job at neutralising the_spice
the_main menu looked interesting too
smaller tapas dishes_with things_like honey chicken
never seen before on an_indian menu
i_think dosas might be one_of_my new favourite things
and rather than_the odd dosa thrown in for_good measure that_other indian restaurnats might too
mezbaan specialise in them
so
in summary
dosa do
the_food_is_good
but_the_service isn't and_the venue is unlikely to impress
is the_food good enough_to compensate for_the shortcomings
probably just_about
but_it's more_of_a quick dosa lunch place than an evening meal spot
overall
we_said
mezbaan undoubtedly serves very_tasty grub
but_the overall restaurant experience feels a_little odd
they definitely need_to do something_about the_look of_the_place
as it_feels unfinished
and given that_the_food they_serve is likely to_be at least somewhat unfamiliar to_many of their_customers
their_service needs to_be entirely more accurate and confident
as i_won't_be alone in seeking to rely upon recommendations from the_waiters
despite these shortcomings
i'd still recommend that you_pay mezbaan a_visit
as their_food_is definitely worth_the_trip
sad_to say i_have_to disagree with_all the_other_reviewers about_how great this_place_is
the_restaurant gets two points for_the_food but ive docked another because_of my
lost umbrella
and ehh service
we_went_to the_restaurant_and they told_us to_come_back in_minutes because_they dont have_any seats open
ok
so we_go_to the_bar next door
grab_a drink_and come_back in_minutes
still no seat available
by this_time
i'm super hungry_and about_to fall over
but_we wait
another_minutes pass and_finally we_get seated
we_ordered_the overpriced thali and_the salmon tikka
tomato rice_and_naan
naan was_fine
salmon tikka_was horribly fishy
thali was_okay but wayyy overpriced
its essentially a hodgepodge of_different curries
i_mean
for all_that
and the_tomato rice
dont get_me staretd on_that
it_tasted liek someone dipped all_the rice into_a vat of butter and handed to_me on a_plate
i_am married to a_south_indian so_i_know whats good
that was_not_good
naan_was the_only_thing_that was_okay in_my_opinion and_i saked for dry naan but again no_one seemed_to listen
the icing on the_top was_that we_left our umbrella there and_were clearly the_last people in_the_restaurant
we call the_restaurant to_ask to_pick it_up and_the_guy said_they didnt have_it
come_on really
its only an umbrella
would i_recommend to others
that_would_be ahem
no
there's only one_thing you_need_to know_about mezbaan they_do cheap as chips
in_fact
probably cheaper than chips
dosas for lunch_or_dinner
for a_dosa as long_as your arm that keep you full till past dinner_time
seriously
check_out_the photo i uploaded of that_bad boy
what_is a_dosa
pray tell
a lentil and_rice flour pancake stuffed full_of yummy spiced goodness
i_love_the peppered lamb
and_the_chicken_tikka is_so flavourful
the_most popular is the_potato one
and mushroom is_nice too
so
for the_same_price or in_fact cheaper than_a pre packaged
factory prepared sandwich from marks spencers
i'd wager they're around right
you_can_get_a freshly cooked dosa for
and_on the_side_of this dosa there is_a_little side_of cococnut raita
and_a_little side_of vegetable_curry
i_mean
really
there's_also a_menu of tapas dishes
so plenty of_options but again just smaller portions
the_dosa isn't small though
and_i_think the_one_i ordered_was the_small
with_a bigger option being available
if you've never_tried a_dosa
go
try one
nom and_be full
wow
good_food_and cheapest lunch i've_had in_a_long_time
i_had_the_lamb dosa that_was massive and deliciously filling
i_thought they_were_all tapas size so ordered a_second
chicken mango sauce
but_when the_samosa arrived i_was realising i_would_have to_ask_for piggy bag
the_place it self could_do with_a renovation at places water damaged wall paper hanging off one wall didn't_really fit the otherwise rather posh table setting and ambience
staff_is_very_friendly and_food comes_out fast_and fresh
a_nice wee indian_place
semi formal place
cheap dosas were a_delight
service
not_so fast
the_dosas here_are still stars
but_after a_recent dinner_here
i_do have_to amend my_review slightly
i'd only ever_been for_lunch before
the_lunch menu_has a_much larger dosa menu
with at least different vegetarian_and different meat dosas
these dosas_are
smaller
and_by smaller i_mean the_size_of a_small baby
they_have lamb dosa
mushroom dosa
two types_of chicken
so_good
and_only
for_a potato dosa
masala_dosa
the_dinner_menu only has dosas total
and the_only meat_options are chicken_or prawn
small prawns at_that
they_are also 'bigger' and_by big i_mean the_size_of your entire body
so big
equally delicious
but i_was_really disappointed when_i_asked if_i_could see_the lunch_time dosa menu_and they_said it_wasn't available
it_was_a quiet monday night
and_if they_were making chicken_tikka dosas i didn't_see why a mushroom dosa would_be out_of_the question
the_service_was_very proper
but_a_little confused
the_girl who served us seemed_very shy and unsure and_had_to re check several_times
and_then took quite a_while to_take_our_order
but_it_was_still nice
they_were friendly_and eager_to please
the_restaurant_itself_is a_bit worn and tired
and bizarrely posh looking
very fancy
like out_of_the s s attempts at being fancy
the_floor
both myself_and my dosa date noticed
was beautiful
old fashioned marble esque black and white tiles
i_do think the_decor could_do with_an upgrade
but the_worst part_was how cold it_was
it_was_a cold january night outside_and whilst the_restaurant_was warmer than outside
we_both_had to_dine with_our jackets on
and_my toes were as cold as ice cubes by_the_time i_left
and our_food went cold very quickly
it_really was far too cold to_be comfortable to_dine_in
i_will still come_here_for the_dosas
and the_dosas alone
they_are wonderful
quite authentic_and unusual to any_other_indian_restaurant in_edinburgh
you_get_a free glass_of_wine with courses
well yes you_do
tasty south_indian_food
my goodness its coconut heaven
lovely food
nice_atmosphere and_service_was spot_on
oh wow
i_can't_believe no_one else has reviewed this_place yet
i've_been_here twice_and it_was_amazing both_times
r and_his family have_been_going here for_a_while now and_love the_place
we'll be_back in_edinburgh in a_week and_there's a_chance we might be having dinner_here one_night so i'll be writing an updated review soon since_it's been two_years since i've_been_here
i'm hoping it's as_good as_i remember
if memory serves
they_make the_most amazing chicken_korma
wow my_mouth is watering already
the khukuri is_an excellent_indian restaurant_which serves amazing_food and_has friendly
efficient service to match
i_came_here_with my flatmates late last year and_we_all thought_it_was great value_for_money considering what a_good_time we_had
the_restaurant_itself feels quaint and cosy with neatly laid out tables
relaxing decor and_some_of_the most friendly_staff you_could ask_for
the_menu_has an_extensive range_of authentic_indian dishes_and prides itself particularly on the_quality_of its meat
i_went_for_the lamb_rogan_josh which_had tender chunks_of lamb_in an aromatic and flavoursome sauce
they_also serve big
filling portions_of rice to_go_with their main_dishes
we spent less_than_a tenner each when the_final bill_came which we_all thought was_excellent deal
this_place_is definitely_worth_a look
if i'd not eaten out again in_town the_night after i_was_here this past weekend i'd_have thought i_was maybe out_of touch with prices through making use_of deals and vouchers over the_past few_months
at per head for_only main_courses
curries
rice_and one naan
and beers this was_more_than i'd paid in quite a_while but it_does seem_to be out_of_the ordinary thankfully
at least when_you're missing out both a_starter and a_dessert
no_complaints about the_food_itself
or for_that matter the_service although_the waiting staff did seem_to_have the odd problem understanding my german guests
both_of whom have an_excellent command of english
so they're maybe used solely to_edinburgh accents
i_will_not though be_back_here anytime soon
the_food_is_good and_the_staff true nepalese
friendly_and soft spoken
this brings me back_to my time_in kathmandu
a_nice_little restauran tfor which i've never yet had_to book a_table
food good
service excellent_and very_reasonable
the_dishes_are mostly indistinguishable from indian_food_but the ocassional nice surprise on_the_menu
a_wee nepalese place_that never struck me as_one worth_trying till my team leader got us there twice for_lunch
and_how glad_i was for_his recommendation
the_first_time_we had l carte dishes
so i_opted_for_the
very_generous
lamb_biryani
which_i found only nd best for_the variety i_have_tried in_edinburgh
some guys ordered the_nepalese beer named khukuri
khukuri stands for_the traditional nepalese blade
and_they_were impressed of_the gentle and_refreshing taste it_has
brewed in_london
for_our second_visit we_tried out_the excellent lunch deal
for_two courses or
for_three
where the_third dish_is either a coffee or a_simple home_made dessert
you_have quite a_decent choice_for main_dish
and_both the_naan_bread and chapati were_very_tasty
there_was_also_a mouth_watering starter
sekuwa
which_you definitely need_to try
grilled chicken_with spices_and an_awesome sauce
in_both cases i_had mango_lassi
which helps balancing whatever spicy curry you_will_get
recommended over_a beer
the_service_was_very_good in_both cases
and_the prices_are_very_reasonable
now i_need_to decide what dish to_try next
i_went_here with_a_large party
and_the_staff treated us like royalty
they_brought_out a_number_of starter dishes so_we did_not_have to_choose everything by single person
even accommodating for_the vegetarians
they_also have_such a variety_of_dishes that_when it_came time to_order for_people
the_staff_were_very patient
the_food_was_great
served_with some nepali beer
and a_variety_of rices and_naan
the_owner even gave us
all
a_small desert on_the house because_we_were celebrating a birthday
they_even wrote out_a card
overall_the dining_experience was_great_and matched the_food as_well
i_highly enjoyed_it
i'm back in_edinburgh again_for work
i_knew there_were_some pretty_good indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
but_never truly got a_recommendation
so this_was_my_first_time at_an_indian_restaurant here
this_is_a punjabi restaurant
right_off_the haymarket bus stop
i_took the bus from hotel to haymarket stop
walked about_minutes
and_found myself at_this_restaurant
i_had_the chicken_tikki_masala and_the curried okra
bhindhi
one_word
marvelous
served it with_some rice_and_garlic_naan
of_course
this_is basically the_only dishes_that i_order at any_indian_restaurant
the_portions_were enough to_fill me_up
i_had maybe a_little leftover
i have_to_admit that the_okra was_so_good that_no matter how full i_was
i_had_to finish the_dish because_it_was that_great
the interior_of the_restaurant_was pretty_nice
it_was_a large restaurant
clean
with new furniture
as_soon_as_we entered
we_were led to_our_table
chairs pulled out to_sit down in
the_only_thing is
i smelled like_the_food when_i left
but
i've run into that with many_different restaurants so_it_was not_a_big deal
so_if_you find yourself in_edinburgh one_day
indian food_is_pretty common and_good
i_would_definitely_recommend_this restaurant
looks pricey
but_not_too bad
great_location
right in_the haymarket area
look_for the_corner with_the big
about gbp per plate
they_have_a pretty average selection_of_indian punjabi cuisine and_a lackluster selection_of desserts
and booze
i_have this incredibly rude habit of walking past restaurants with large windows and glaring at_the people eating
this_is exactly_what_i did with omar khayyam and promptly told my_boyfriend we_had to_try_it
the_restaurant_is quite bright_and spacious due_to_the large windows
most indians seem_to feel dark and dingy
but_not this_one
the_staff_were_very friendly_and service prompt
the_menu lists the_usual indian_dishes you_would_expect
and_there_is_a good_selection
the_price ranges up_to around a tenner for a_main
so_it could_get costly if_you_order a_lot
i_had_a biryani which_came as a_huge portion
it was_so_delicious i_felt bad leaving half_of it
the_other half had_a lamb_rogan_josh which_he wolfed down as men do
i_enjoyed_the poppadums
rice_and_naan bread that_we_had alongside it
i literally felt like if_i was wearing a belt i_would_have_to loosen to_it
this_restaurant_is only_two minutes walk_from haymarket station so ideal if_you_are going_to and from_the station
they_offer_a set lunch meal also which_would bring the_price done significantly and_definitely fill you_up until tea time
i'm a_bit_of_a spice pussy
so_a korma will_do me nicely thank_you
but_this korma is_really_good
you_can just tell it's going straight to_your hips though
it's too creamy to_be_good for_you
my_dad had_a somewhat adventurous bhuna
and_loved_it
he said the_meat_was cooked_well
which_is_a surprise
and_the_sauce was_really_tasty
all in_all it was_a_good_experience
however the_price_was a but hefty
albeit with_a bottle_of_wine
it was_a_good_experience though
omar khayyam is_a_great indian_restaurant_and although_the prices_are_pretty steep
the_food_and service_is_excellent
i_came_here_with my_parents last year and_we_all thought_it_was amazing with authentic_indian dishes ranging_from marinated sea bass to chicken_tikka_masala
i_went_for_the shami kebab starter followed by_the lamb_tikka
they_didn't take long at_all to_arrive and tasted_great when they_did
all the_meat which they_use is of the_highest quality_and the_lamb_was_tender with_no chunks_of fat or sinew whatsoever
most mains cost at least and side orders_of rice_or vegetables are_about each
it's_not_a cheap meal
but_the_food
service_and general ambiance all make the_cost well_worth_it
we_are not the_most at experienced indian_food but_we_were impressed_with_the taste and_quality_of omar's food as_well_as_the good_service and value
having left a_rather atmosphere lacking whighams wine cellar
i made_the short journey to_the crossroads at haymarket where_i was off_to treat myself to a_curry
the crossroads are_more a massive mess of ugly tram works
but omar khayyam is_a beacon of chic and stylish light at what used_to_be_a very_busy traffic point
on approaching the_front door to_the_restaurant
i_was warmly greeted by one_of_the servers who opened the inner door for_me_and showed me_to a_big table where_i choose the comfy booth seat over_the chair
he_also offered_to hang my coat up
which_i declined as_i just folded it neatly and placed it_on_the bench beside me
i_arrived early
my_date still on_his way
but_this didn't stop the_waiter bringing me water
a_glass_of red_wine
and poppadums with dips
once my_date had arrived_and taken his seat
he_was quickly approached by_the ever efficient waiter and_asked if_he wanted a_drink
to which_he order_a pint of kingfisher
they_don't appear to_have cobra here
and was_brought this seconds later
we_had_a look_at_the menu
opting to_just go_for main_dishes and add a_side
using the poppadoms as_our starter
after_ordering our mains
we_started in on_the poppadums that_were nice_and crispy_and accompained with_three very_tasty dips
there_was the_regular mango_chutney
which was_a_bit to sweet for_me
a_spicy raita
and_the_best spicy onions i've ever_had
the_onions were_fresh
mixed_with bits_of tomato in_a zesty and spicy_sauce that_made them the_perfect topping for_the crisp poppadums
our food_arrived so quickly that we_hadn't even finished the poppadums yet
but the_waiter solved that problem by putting the remaining poppadum on_top_of the_naan_bread and leaving use with the_dips
now the_main_dishes
omg hello flavour explosion
i_ordered_the punjabi karahi with chicken_and this_dish was_the_perfect blend_of_spices and curry_and_a chilli kick
there_was_a really warming taste_of cinnamon mixed in_which just brought the_dish to_a five_star review rating
it_was_so_good i_ate all_of_it
even though i_felt_like i'd_have to roll myself home
my_date had_the black pepper chicken
which_i used some naan_bread to_dip in_the_sauce
i_also found this_dish very_tasty_and would be_happy_to order_it next_time_i go
we_shared pilau_rice
an onion_naan
and_a very_tasty side_of aloo palak
spinach_and curried potatoes
the_only_thing left after_we devoured this incredibly delicious meal_was a_bit_of naan_that neither_of us could fit into_our overly full tummies
so the_food_was outstandingly delish
but the_service_was_also something_to compete with
the_waiters seem_to always be_there with what_you needed and_everything_was served so quickly
but_they made_us_feel comfortable to linger over our_meal and not_be rushed out the_door
i also_liked the_hot towels they_brought after clearing away the_plates
these_were proper hot towels not_the lame wet tissue like ones you_get in other_places
the_restaurant also looks like_it's recently been done up_and the_decor_is all sumptious dark colours and_clean lines
clearly
i loved_this_place
i_will_definitely_be making the_extra journey to_come_here again_for some_more delicious curry delights
looks are deceiving
the_restaurant looks quite expensive from the_outside
and sitting smack bang in_the centre of_town you'd think prices would reflect its location
however
a_decent meal will set you back less than per head
the_restaurant_is large_and well kept
my_last_visit saw the_tables packed
varied selection_of favourite curries on_offer
all dishes ordered were destroyed in about fifteen minutes with_lots_of head nodding
so_the grub definitely hits_the spot
i suspect the_desserts are bought in so_i steered clear of_them and opted for a_mango_lassi instead delicious
good option if_you_are looking_for_a half decent curry that won't break the bank
meaning 'the food provider'
ann purna certainly does provide on many levels
boasting itself as_a vegitarian restaurant
but_also preparing meat_dishes
this traditional indian_restaurant really blew me_away
having been persuaded to_go by a_vegetarian friend
which i_am_not
i_was_pleasantly suprised to_be so impressed_with_the vegetarian_dishes on_the_menu_that i_went_for something totally meat free why go_for meat when any restaurant can do_that
and to_be_honest
i'm_really glad that_i_did go_for_the bahar e nau korma as it_was_delicious
a combination_of carrots
potatoes_and kashew nuts
service_was_excellent
and over_all the_meal_was cheaper than i_had expected
wandered in_here my last_night in_edinburgh a_few_weeks_ago
not_really knowing what_to_expect
the_uk in_general is_full of_great indian_restaurants so i_was_excited_to be trying some out
of_course i_didn't pay attention_to the sign_that read
the finest indian vegetarian gujarati cuisine
and seeing how i_love my meat
i did_not_have high hopes
boy was_i surprised
the food_was_absolutely incredible
my_parents and_i_shared several dishes
matar reiggna
bahar e nau korma
ann purna baingan
a_side_of sindhri batata
along_with some roti
every_dish exploded with_flavor and_the_portions_were nicely sized
gujarati is_a province in northwest india that_is known for it's vegetarian cuisine and_i was_very_happy to_try_some excellent authentic_food from_the region
the_servers_were all very_friendly_and happy to_explain all_of their interesting foreign dishes to_us americans
if ever in_edinburgh
definitely check_it_out
i_got dragged in_here by a_vegetarian friend of_mine
against all_my principles
i'm definitely_a meat person
i'm glad she coerced me into_it though
the_food_was absolutely_amazing and made_me eat my words about_how it_would_be boring and bland
humble pie fully swallowed
my smug looking friend_and_i had_their lunchtime buffet_which costs
for all_you_can_eat
unlike a_lot_of_indian places offering cheap buffets like_this
the_food_was_really well_cooked to the_same standard that you'd_expect if you'd ordered la_carte
the_service_was really_friendly too
and_we didn't_have_to think twice about whether or_not we were_going_to leave_a tip
and_i'll definitely_be heading back
although next_time i'll be trying one_of_the_few meat_options i spied on_their main menu
long story short
even if_it_were a_veggie restaurant
it's that_good that_even the_most carnivorous types will_be suitably impressed
as it's_not
you_have absolutely no excuse not to_give_it_a go
i_finally visited ann purna the_other_night
as_a_vegetarian
i'm_really glad there_are_so many_vegetarian restaurants_in_edinburgh
especially a_few_more affordable ones
i've noticed some strange comments for some_of_the veggie restaurant reviews around edinburgh
some comment about the_fact_that despite the_fact they eat meat they enjoyed a_meat free meal
as if_they_are surprised_that the addition of_meat doesn't magically make something taste nice
the_other common point made is_that_they didn't enjoy a_vegetarian restaurant because_it had_no meat_in it
it's sad that a_restaurant can't_be evaluated in_its own terms
we_don't review an italian saying
well i_usually eat only thai food so_this italian was_a_bit crap
i assume that_even reviewers who claim they can't live without eating meat don't judge their morning toast by_its absence of beef
so let me say_that ann purna is a_restaurant that_serves great_food irrespective of_its absence of_meat
if anything this proves just how flavourful
nutritious and_filling vegetarian_food can_be
apparently they_do serve some meat_dishes when requested
but_this seems pointless
so yeah
i_thought the_food_here tasted_great
my_girlfriend_and i_ordered_a sweet
coconut flavoured
creamy dish_which brilliantly complemented another savoury
tomato based aubergine curry
along_with_the saffron rice
which remember you_have_to order separately as its_not included_in the_price_of the_curry
this meal_was satisfying
it_was_a_little higher than_average price wise
when_you take into account the_curry
the_rice
and probable bread
poppadoms or side_dishes
all in_all expect_to_pay around_for a not_too extravagant but filling meal
as_for service
it_was a_bit_of_a let down
the_staff_were_very welcoming but_we_had a_bit_of strange experience while ordering
the_waiter seemed overly keen to_get us to_order_a starter we_just didn't_want
he_then insisted we_ordered_a side dish
we already wanted poppadoms
and when_they arrived
it_came_with a range_of chutneys to_try
great
we_thought
complimentary dips
only when_we looked_at our bill we discovered it_wasn't complementary at_all
they_had seemingly brought_us something and charged us without a_word
to makes things stranger
they_also deducted two_of our poppadoms which actually were complimentary only they cost much less than_the they charged us_for the_chutney without telling
i'm_going to_give_them the benefit of_the doubt and say_they messed up
otherwise this was_pretty unacceptable
you_don't want_a homely
student friendly
restaurant_to rip you_off
i_look_forward_to revisiting and finding out
this experience however couldn't detract from_the excellent_food
it_was_so_good it's inspired me to_be_more adventurous with my_own curry_in future
as_i mentioned before
i_found_the food filling
as_someone with_a_big appetite this_isn't often the_case
i_thought_the portions looked small at_first
but_they didn't_feel small after
the_creamy dishes_are especially filling
definitely recommended
just double check your bill
the_best_indian vegetarian_food
the_sign outside proudly proclaims
i admit
when_i eat_indian_food
or_any food for_that matter
of_the_time it involves meat
every_time
i_recently went_on_a will ferrel movie binge
sorry for_the awful references
back_on track
so basically
my reference point for other vegetarian indian_food_is limited
but_i_can say_i adored the_food_here
even the_dips for_our popadoms
there_were of_them
swish
were lovely
i_ordered_the fried
baked aubergine curry_and split with_my neighbour the_other aubergine dish_which was_served chopped with_nuts
of_the_two i prefered the_one that_was served_with nuts as the_aubergine was_in big chunks
whereas with the_other you couldn't really taste the_texture of the_aubergine
i_also_tried the_aloo_gobi
potato curry
and it_was_amazing
the thing_that struck me was_that each curry_sauce had_a completely different flavour
and you_could really see_the different spices_in it
there_wasn't_a tikka_masala
jalfrezi
or rogan_josh in sight
basically
this_was authentic indian_cuisine
quite a_lot_of the_dishes_were also vegan
which_was_a big plus as_the birthday girl we_were dining_with happened_to be_so
the_only downer is none_of_the desserts were vegan
including_the pineapple
mango and payaya
this confused me slightly
the_house white wine was_also_very nice
which_is_a plus
the_only_reason i'm holding back that fifth star is that_it_was outside that_night
a nd the_restaurant_was really quite cold
indian_food_is hot
warming
fragrant and_it needs to_be complimented by_a hot
bustling interior
sadly
whilst not_exactly outdoor temperatures
it_was_pretty cold
my_food cooled quickly as a_result
and_my toes went numb
hmm
for authentic
good_indian_food
not
british
indian
even_the sworn meat_eaters like myself won't fail to_be disappointed
friendly_service too
sometimes when you_want indian_food
you_don't know exactly what dish your tummy is asking_for
so_the answer of_course is_the indian_lunch_buffet
my_first_visit to ann purna was_a smashing success
i_was_on my_own
so had_plenty_of time_for
too
many visits to_the_food table
the_pakora starters were_fresh and_crispy
with the_vegetables as_the star
not_the batter
they_offer_a small selection_of main_dishes
and to_be_honest
when i_took_my first look_at them
i_was prepared to_be underwhelmed
the_sauces looked watery_and they_seemed to_have_some vegetable combos i_didn't recognize
although as_a anglo my vegetarian indian_cuisine knowledge is somewhat limited
however
the_food_was simply wonderful
my_favorite_was what_i think was_a saucy variation of aloo_gobi
it_was deliciously sweet
creamy spicy
the_lentil dal
which_i usually don't_care for
was_a_great excuse for_more basmati naan
which was_fresh_and puffy from_the oven
i_was early for_lunch
just before noon
and_sat and read while the_buffet_was prepared
i_think_it was_ready to_go between
i_ate so_much i_didn't_want supper later that evening
so it_was_a good_value_for me
what_a_great location in st
patrick's square
easy_to_get to from the_city centre and the_university
and about a_mile walk home_for me
i've_been_here twice
pre and post makeover
and_the_food_is divine
a_little different_from most_places as_it_is vegetarian
but_the_food_is so_good you won't even think about the_lack_of meat_dishes
recommended
sometimes with yelp you_can_get_a bit carried away with the_idea_of a_place_that the reality can let_you down
it_wasn't really the_case
although i_think_i would shy away from describing the_food_here as incredible
but_it at the_same_time
extremely good_and what_is more
entirely up_my vegetable strewn street
as_i_was incapable of making_a decision on such_an aubergine heavy menu
oh how i_love you so
and_the boy lost without meat_options
we chose both thali options
to_get a_few_different taste sensations
as we_did with_a green pea
aubergine and_potato dish coming out_on top for_us
followed by chickpea and_potato as_well_as_a mixed_vegetable bhaji
the_rice_was perfumed with_spices
the chapattis burning hot from_the oven
i_wasn't blown_away by the_samosas or pakoras
and_found the dhal lacking_in flavour
but_overall
the_quality_of_food was high
have_to give_a nod to the_service as_well
very_friendly_and pleasant to_be around
there_was_an introduction to_some of_the_dishes on our_plates when_they arrived
glasses_of water part way through and offerings of complimentary drinks at_the_end
which_we were_too stuffed to accept
i_will also note that although_i did_enjoy the poppadoms
had_more flavour than others i_have_tried
and_the multitude of_chutneys a fiver for_the pleasure was_much too high as noted by_a reviewer for another_restaurant
there_is_a large markup on puffs of air
and_i definitely experienced that last_night
and we_paid nearly eight quid on_one beer_and a_fresh orange and lemonade
which also seemed rather steep to_me
i_have_to note though
prices_for the_rest_of_the meal seemed much_more reasonable
but it_will_be sometime to remember for my_next_visit
it_was busy on_a_saturday when_i_was there_so service_was slow
i_tried_to overlook the_fact_that the_table beside us were_served before us even though_they arrived after us
the_food_was fine
nothing_special
i_like when_you_are automatically given_a jug of_water in_an_indian_restaurant but it_took quite a_while_to get_any water when_we_asked for_it
we_paid our bill and_then finished up our_drinks
as_we walked out_of_the restaurant we_were called back by two waiters and accused of not paying_for our_meal
i_won't_be in_a_hurry to_return
omg
what a_terrible experience
we picked this_restaurant by chance and_so many_things went wrong here's a detailed report
it showed from_the very beginning
i and_my_friend were given_a seat and menu on_a set table_for four
during browsing
the_waiter removed the_things from_the two_other seats as_it_should
but he_also took_our empty wine glasses without even asking if we_are taking wine
well
we_ordered_a thalli
pounds
which_included a started and_also a_side
accompanying
portion each
the_waiter asked_if_we want_a poppadom and accepted
he did_not tell us the_price
i_asked_for a wine_list
but_the had_only local wine
pounds glass
we_also wanted_a jug of_water
we_got served glasses_of water_with ice
and_the glass_of_wine very quickly
and_an acceptable mins later the poppadom arrived
it_was_very thin_and breaks in small pieces
so i_am_not_sure if_it_was the_way it_should_be
two poppadoms came_with sauces
my_friend drank her glass_of_water and_ask twice for_a jug of_water but_was in vain
i_had_to stand up by_the bar_and ask it specifically
and_then it_was served
in_the meantime some new diners came along and_took a seat beside us
mins passed after finishing our poppadom and_we have_not yet been served
i drank my wine already
then we_saw two thali dishes coming at last we_said
but
they_were served to_the diners who came after us beside us
we kindly pointed out_the issue
and_the_waiter said ours is coming soon
no problem'
the diners besides us apologized
even_if they_had not_to but_they_were british
after minutes the_waiter_brought two large plates
we_started to wonder why
then mins after a_single thali dish
we_asked were is the_other one
the_waiter disappeared and ignored us
we realized the_two plates are for sharing so_we called the head waiter
a_indian with_a green t shirt
and_after consulting with the_waiter
who_was kind inexperienced and_not focused
he said it_is coming because the_waiter took an_order_of instead
my_friend who_was scottish was complaining and stood up to_leave away
so the_waiter said_he will_give the nd thali for_free to compensate the mistake
being so hungry
and_did_not want_to waste time during sat night at_the fringe we accepted
so we_shared_the first one
and_then mins after the_second one arrived
while_eating the_second thali
we realized that_there should have_been_a starter included
so_we asked_the neighbouring diners
who took the_same thali
and confirmed they_did had a_starter
so_there we_go for_another complaint and_the_waiter replying its
ok
i bring_it now
more mins
and_so we_ended eating the_starter at_the_end_of the_main_course
then we_just wished to_leave asap and_asked_for the_bill
it_was_a notepad page with the_price in barely legible red ink
except the_final price which_was gbp
i realized he did_not gave_the nd thali for_free
so again went personally for complaining
and_he_said oh yes sure then its pounds
then still
on_the_way out we_were asing if the_price_of was_right was_a poppadom
wine
thali_and side portions
and jug of_water
perhaps we_were charged for_this
by the_way
i_forgot to_tell you_that from_the two side portions only_one came
vegetables with_spices
few shredded lettuce
a sliced tomato
rings of cucumber and cinnamon the_only spice
yck
actually we_got_a chat_with the neighbour diners who_were sorry for_us and_told_us that_they_have been_here months_ago and was_very_good
but_now the_management changed and they_also did_not liked_the long waiting
that_was my_experience
so_you_can judge for_your future considerations
the raj seem_to always_have an offer of prices
they certainly are_reasonable
it's_a_nice restaurant_which actually has_a cinema at_the back
the_windows look out over_the water of leith and at_night it's_a very cosmopolitan outlook
they_do_a green chicken_dish which has_to_be seen to_be believed
i've even been_there_for christmas dinner and_that_was smashing
the raj is a_long established indian_restaurant_and takeaway in_the shore area_of leith
i_tried_it out for_the_first_time a_few_weeks_ago after they_put a_menu through my door
proof that direct marketing works sometimes
the_deal was_that you_could order any two curries
two rice
nan
poppadoms_and two beers for
this_is ridiculously good_value and you_would be_hard pushed to_find anywhere else that_could better it
we drove down_to collect the_meal
so i_was_able_to have_a look inside the_restaurant too
it_is perhaps in need of a_bit_of an update
but_still looked_like a_pleasant enough place to_have_a meal and_the view outside over_the water made leith look_like amsterdam
meaning very pretty
not full_of prostitutes
the food_was_tasty and_the_lamb in_my gosht hindustani was good_quality and_not sinewy or fatty
next_time_i fancy a_curry
i'll give_the raj a ring
i_cannot sing this restaurant's praises enough
i_can truly say
hand on heart
my_favourite indian_restaurant_that i've ever_been_to anywhere
i've_been_here many_times and_have_never not enjoyed or_even been_disappointed with_any of_the_dishes i've_eaten
the flavours_and spice combinations that explode in_your_mouth during each bite is spectacular truly a_pleasure
what are_you waiting_for
go now
this_restaurant_is at_the corner_of my street at is_a convenient place_for_a little bite to_eat
staff_are nice but the_price_is to much for_the_quality you reserve
not_the_best_indian meal i_have_ever_had
it_is_a_bit dated and_its reputation is_better_than in reality
wouldn't tell people not to_go but_there_are better_indian_restaurants close_by
my_boyfriend_and_i had_been attempting to cut down_on the_number_of takeaways we_were_eating
and had_been doing so_well
until last_night when laziness and_a desire for_curry overcame us_and we_ordered from_the raj
we'd not ordered before
but being leith residents had walked by a_few_times_and had heard_of 'curry in_a hurry' so thought we'd give_it_a go
and set to choosing what_we_wanted from_the leaflet pushed through our letterbox a_couple_of_weeks ago
the_deal advertised on the_front is for_two curries
chicken
lamb or veg
two rice
a_naan
poppadoms_and two 'free' beers for
pretty_decent
it_doesn't specifiy any further than_that
but it_would appear that despite ordering two chicken_curries
sag and pasanda
two rice
albeit one_of_them pilau
a_naan
peshwari
and poppadoms we obviously didn't qualify for_the discount
perhaps our tastes in rice_and_naan meant we_were disqualified it_would_be a_better idea for_the leaflet
and the_website
i checked
to specify what rice_and_naan were included
our total was
which_was about p more_than i'd calculated off_the_menu
the_rice_was fine
although_the container wasn't completely full like_most are
and the_curries_were decent
the sag was nicely spicey
and_my_boyfriend said he'd be_happy to_order_the pasanda again
and most_importantly to_a poppadom fiend like myself
the poppadoms were absolutely fine
is_it possible to_get_a truly excellent poppadom
i_don't_know
but_you_can certainly get bad ones
i_can't_say anything was particularly outstanding
and_it's annoying to_find_out when_the delivery arrives that_you have_to_pay more_than the advertised deal
but_the_food_was okay and delivery was_prompt
though not_quite as swift as the_half an_hour i_was_told on_the_phone
we may well order again
but_with so_many indians to_choose_from we'll probably keep trying_to find 'the one'
i've_been_to the raj a_few_times since moving_to leith years_ago and_always thought_it_was ok
i_went last month however and it_was_just a_bit tired
no_one there really seems_to care_about the business
which saddens me as_it's a_lovely spot with_some unique stuff about_it
the_portions aren't particularly big
for_the_price you_pay certainly
and none_of_the food really delighted me
i_hope things improve before long
my local takeaway and_very hit_or_miss
the_prices_are excellent for what_you_get and_although i've yet to_have a_bad_meal from_here
there_is really absolutely no consistency to_their offering
i'm_a pretty simple gal when_it_comes_to my_tastes with_indian_food and_although i'll occasionally wander off piste i more often than not_order the_same_thing
as such i've_had a_pretty_good litmus test over the_past year for_that lack_of consistency sometimes my_chicken passanda is_lovely and_creamy with_a thick sauce that's_just made for_dipping naan_bread in
and_sometimes it's incredibly watery_and soupy
likewise
the peshwari_naan wobbles about from divine to woeful
on a_good day the_inside will_be beautifully coated
bright orange and_so flavoursome you almost don't_want_to dip it_in anything
whereas other times it_looks_like they_just threw some dessicated coconut inside as_an afterthought
a_lot_of this seems_to be down_to the day_of the_week
with weekends having_the stronger serving
but_i really wish_they could just nail this all week round
although i've ordered takeaway from_the raj
i_doubt i'd ever choose to_have_a sit down meal there
the_decor_is incredibly tired and_a_bit grubby
it's_not often very_busy either which does bring the_ambiance down a_little
it_could probably do with_some background music to_try to perk the_place up a_bit
they_could also_do with installing a till system
they simply tot up your_order using a_menu and_a calculator and i_don't_think i've been quoted the_same_price for_the_same meal more_than once
in summary
amazing_food at weekends and_a fab price
but pretty woeful otherwise
my_favorite study break over eating place or post pint feast site
kebabs are_great
the mushroom and lamb_curry is_amazing
you_will likely have tummy issues after but it's_worth_it
cheaper than most_places around
i_miss you
a_lot
im glad_that when_i get_back all_the tourists will_be gone and we_can rekindle our love
i_will ask_for_a chicken_tikka_masala
and_i_will carress and_love it_before inhaling it_and licking the_plate
please behave while im gone
awesome even_though_i wasn't_too adventurous with tikka_masala
which_is my gold standard to_compare others to
it_was_fantastic
service_was_excellent and_the_price was_just_right
fantasies of you_are inspiring me to_finish my phd proposal that will_be the_only hope of_our reunion
please don't change
except maybe you_could get more tables
and_do delivery
and revamp the toilets
but_nothing else
if_i don't_get accepted
or funding
i_will_be your us rep and together we_will conquer a country of generally mediocre indian_food
xxoo
i_am addicted to_this_place
i_go twice a_week
every_week
i_can't_believe they_don't deliver
they won the_best_curry award for
hands down my_favourite indian_place in_edinburgh
the_lamb bhuna is_amazing
aside from near perfect food
the_atmosphere_is_nice
and_the_owner is_a_very gracious man who_is eager_to take_care of_his patrons
i_miss eating_there
and it_will_be atop my list_of eateries when_i return_to the 'burgh
and_if_you haven't tried_it
their baklava is the_best_i've_ever_had
and_only about_a quid per piece
decadent
sumptous
mouth_watering
exquisite
superlatives really_do struggle to adequately describe just how_good the_food_is at kebab_mahal
while their kebabs are approximately one million times better_than_the sweat soaked doners you'll find_in am joints
it's the_curries that_really take_the biscuit
quite simply
they_are the_best_i've_ever eaten
talking about_them doesn't do them justice
you simply have_to_try one for_yourself
i've_only been_to kebab_mahal once and_that_was the_first night after i_moved into my_new flat last summer
four_of us turned up_and waited_for about five minutes for_a_table because_it_was well beyond maximum capacity as_it_was so busy
i_ordered_the_lamb balti with_rice_and_a naan and_we_were eventually seated
the_atmosphere_is particularly special as_it_is ethnically diverse with cool music and_amazing smells wafting from_the_kitchen
it_was_a_very fortunate thing_that it_had_a good atmosphere because_we literally waited_for about an minutes_for_our food arrive
but_when it_did it_was well_worth_it
the_lamb_was good_quality with virtually no sinuous or fatty bits amongst it and_the flavour of the_sauce_was delicious
it_was seriously spicy
but_my flatmate ordered_the_chicken madras which blew my_head off after just_a mouthful and_he_was literally dripping with sweat after about five minutes of eating_it
kebab_mahal serves authentic_indian_food at relatively cheap prices_and is_definitely worth_a_visit for an_amazing dinner any night of the_week
as the_name suggests they specialise in kebabs and
although i_haven't_tried them myself
they're meant to_be incredible
i_had_heard amazing things about_this kebab house
but_not being_a kebab lover myself i_didn't know_how_to judge it
i_was_surprised at_how tasty the_meat_was i_didn't_think the_huge chunk of_meat on_the spit looked appetizing until it_was sliding down_my throat
i_must admit i've_only been once and_it_was following a_rather liquid lunch
but_i'll be_back and explore the_menu further
but so_far so very
very_good
helllllllllllllllllo kebab_mahal
you tryin to make_me fat
so goood
one_day i'll come to_this_restaurant not be_able_to leave the_food_is_so bang on
damn
i_thought_this place_was_a secret
this_place_is what yelp was made_for
if you did_not know you_would probably_would not bother
this_place_is no secret to folks who love decent curries
lots_of regulars from_the local_indian community to be_found here and_always some student newbies
occasionally with american accents
mister khan is_really_nice fellow and_his friends in_the_back make tremendous curries
you_could just wander in_here and get_a kebab or some pakora
however
the folks who know will sit in_the_back
get yourself a_lovely beverage
no alcohol served like_all of_the_best_indian_restaurants
and enjoy_the fabulous curries
the_portions_are immense and_the curries_and breads are_always well_made
finally
when_you leave the_price will startle you
it_is stupidly low priced
wouldn't it be_great if all_of_the places_that looked kebab_mahal were this good
a nasty looking off license with_a security screen had_some lovely chimay or gambrinus in_the beer chiller
or a_cheap cafe that served the greatest breakfast ever
so
i_told you yeah it_is_great now don't spoil it
the_curries_are so hot in_this_place that_even the_onion bhajis were too_hot for_me
really cheap
great curry if_you_can take the_heat
good for_both take_out_and eating in
but it's_quite small
excellent curry_in a_family_run establishment with a_total of six tables
the_service_is quick_and the_food_is_great
we_had chicken_tikka_masala
excellent
and_lamb bhuna
very_good
thank_you
yelpsters
for_a_great tip
great for_a_quick lunch
so_tasty
best kebabs in_edinburgh
service a_bit_slow but_hey
it's busy for_a reason
small spot not_great for a_large_group
large_portions
good_prices
and it_tastes great
if_you_are looking_for_a_good curry or kebab
then_this is_your place
i_can't imagine there's_a better place in_all_of edinburgh
cheap_and casual
it_would_be easy_to mistake kebab_mahal for_just another place_that sells processed shaved meats
its unassuming and dated appearance not doing it any favours however the_old saying is_true one should_not judge_a book_by it's cover
the_food_is_excellent from_the mild rich_and creamy chicken_tikka_masala to_the more_spicy madras or vindaloo which have_a_good balance_of heat_and flavour and real kebabs
the_only_thing ever to_take me by surprise is_that_the chicken_pakora is_on_the bone delicious but something to_be aware_of
to sum up
yes it_can_be very_busy
is_small_and looks dated however if_you_want good food_at_a good_price kebab_mahal is_one_of_the_best places to_get_a curry in_edinburgh and_i for_one hope it_never changes
i_would call this little_gem one_of edinburgh's hidden secrets
although judging by all_the positive comments on_here perhaps it's_not that well hidden
from the_outside it_looks_like a ropey kebab shop
but step inside and_you'll be treated to_some_of the_best_indian_food_in_town
the naan_breads are_big soft pillows and_the currys are bursting with flavour
yes
even the_korma
i_am currently
as_i type this
the_very proud parent of_a food baby which_i named after it's daddy wee mehal
it's_been less_than_a few hours since i_had_my first kebab mehal meal and_one i'll remember for_a_long while yet
all_the reviews_on_yelp are true
it's simply fantastic
i_feel i_can't add much to_what has already been said
sometimes on_yelp you_find a business that has_some star
some star reviews
some_people adore it
some_people are impartial
and occasionally someone disliked it
but kebab mehal
reading through_the others
is certainly 'one size fits all' in the_best way possible
if_your size consists of elastic waisted relaxi pants
it helps
it_looks_like nothing on_the_outside
or rather
it_looks_like every_other kebab shop you_see
and_there_are a_lot_of kebab shops in_edinburgh that_are in equal parts kebab shop and pizza chip
only frequented after am when under_the influence
in_this respect
do_not judge this book_by its cover
inside it_is plain
a diner
a_bit scaffy
not_a criticism
just the_way it_is
but smells that greet you
oh_and the sight of_those freshly made poppadoms_and pakoras
the_menu_is simple
there_is no signature dish
it's_just
all_of_it is brilliant
as charles says
it's family_run
the_owner manager
was_very_friendly
the_service prompt although certainly no frills
all i'll say_is
the_food_is amazingly good_indian
no runny sauces
tough meats
instead fresh breads
super_spicy dips
hot off the_grill lamb
the vegetable_biryani
with_a_side serving_of biryani sauce
was loaded with
well veg
there's_also pools of_that ghee oil at_the_end which_comes back_to haunt you
but_you don't_even care
it_was_that good
definitely_not a 'meal out' type place
if you're going_on a fancy date
or a_family meal
you come_in from_the cold at pm_on_a freezing january day
you keep your coat on whilst you_eat
you stay half_an hour_and savour the_food
or you_come at_night after_a dance class
still sweaty faced
and refuel on the_tastiest carbs around
it's no nonsense
but delicious
and_i_think i'm a_little_bit in_love
i_live almost around_the_corner from_the kebab_mahal and_i loveeeeeeee it
there really isn't_that much_more to_say that's not_been said before
i'm_very
very_picky about_my doner kebab
that's how_we write it_in dutch
shut it
and_i_love what they_do here
they just_can't do_a thing wrong
if_you_ask me
their meat_is absolutely_delicious
their wraps are gorgeous and_the dressings are_good and proper the_way they_should be
it's the_one place that_makes me_feel at_home in_edinburgh
pop in
especially after_a late_night out
this_place_will make_you very_happy indeed
right
so_after my_last review_of kebab_mahal
i_decided that_i_was hungry
so i_went_back to kebab_mahal
of_course
this_time i_went_for_the lamb_curry something i_hadn't tried before_and
being indonesian and_curry prone myself
i_think_i died of bliss
i shuffled in
holding my_stomach
bent over_and clearly in the_final stages of hunger pains
after having placed my_order and_being greeted by almost all_of_the friendly clientele and_staff the_curry arrived
a_light opened up above me
trumpets sounded
a harp was gently plucked
and_i may or may_not have_taken a nose dive into the_curry
look
i'm sensitive to heat_and so_this burnt my throat and mouth to_a point_of angst ridden pain but_it_was soooo good_that despite_the pain
i_couldn't stop_eating
my fault for trusting them when they_said there_were very few chillies in_there
almost none
what am_i saying
i'm saying get_your bee hinds over here and_have ye some curry
doesn't get better
really doesn't
and_they're so incredibly friendly
as_a matter of fact
why
i_do believe it's almost lunch_time
muahhahaha
we_made a beeline here_after the rave reviews_and
forewarned
we_weren't expecting_a fancy place
maybe it_was because_we_were looking_forward_to it so_much_that our expectations were somewhat dimmed
the_food_was generally average
we_felt
my vindaloo_was spicy_enough but the_meat_was a_bit tough and
temperature wise
could've done_with being hotter
the_naan_was not_great and_didn't seem fresh or have_that
just cooked
fluffiness
service_was adequate
but slow
as there_was_a steady stream of_people picking_up takeouts
you help yourself to soft_drinks from_a chiller at_the back
the_prices_were reasonable
sorry
other lovers of_this_place
but mother_india is miles better
and_not a_lot_more expensive
so we'll be sticking to_that
or kebabish
why oh why have you led so_far astray yelp
this hole in_the_wall restaurant_was to_be_a great secret delicious place
instead it turned_out that_it_was_a filthy hovel with terrible starch to_fill the_belly
waiters with foul yellow stains from_their own food eating misadventures
meat sitting_in unrefridgerated counters and_a dining_room that resembled the boiler room from_a b horror film
the_food_was_not cheap in_comparison to_some amazing restaurants we_enjoyed at_lunch such_as mussel and steak just a_short walk_away
i_know this_is supposedly a_good_place for university students but_i_would gladly go_back_to ramon noodles and fluorescent mac and_cheese
they seat you at_a dingy table while_you contemplate running out before someone notices you and_then man with_a untucked shirt with stains and_an unkempt beard asks for your_order
the_smell_of stale food and_dry spices fill the nostrils and_then the_food arrives
rice that's lukewarm and_veggies straight from_the freezer in spices to hide the freezer burn taste
singed bread_that is cool as_well_and soon you wonder if all they_have in_the_kitchen is_a freezer
a toaster and an_old microwave
the_bill is_not printed out but rather shown to_you on_a calculator
hmm i_wonder why
do yourself a_favor and call the_health inspector on_this burke and hare show they call an_indian_restaurant
run
es la mejor comida india que he probado
es un garito cutre llevado por una familia pero
la comida es absolutamente deliciosa y abundante
vale la pena
tasty food_for_a reasonable_price
not the_nicest venue however if_i_lived in_edinburgh i_would frequent this_place for_sure
this is_just_a tiny place run_by a_few guys
but it_gets packed and_is well_worth squeezing in
we_had_some fantastic samosa to_start
then dove into tikka_masala_and lamb bhuna
both_of which_were amazing
price_was shockingly reasonable
cheap even
hard not_to love
tipsy and craving_some delicious nighttime kebab
kebab_mahal will_be there for_you with_a delicious doener filled_with greasy meat
drippy sauces
and_garlic breath the_next morning
kinda grotty and_not_the absolute best doener place in_edinburgh
but it_will forever hold a_special place_in my_heart
and likely my arteries
do_not judge_a book_by its cover
and certainly do_not judge kebab_mahal by_its appearance
it_will reward you with_one delightful indian_food experience
from the_chicken_tikka karahi to lamb_tikka bhuna
every plate is_delicious_and generous on_the size
accompanied with_a_couple_of nans and_you have_an unforgettable ethnic feast
our_meal ended with_a baklava and_a kataifi which_was equally delicious and_we hardly reached a bill
best_indian in_edinburgh for_sure
and_if_you know_the cardinality of_the set
indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
that says a_lot
i'm sad this_place_is so_well known i_thought_it_was my_friends_and_i
are own little secret
but_since the cat is out_of_the bag i_am yelping it
this_place_is hands_down_the best_curry shop in the_whole city
it's the_perfect little hole in_the_wall and_when_i first walked by it i_took one look_at it_and knew this_place was_going_to_be good
my saudi friend then took_my here and_i_was hooked
i_was ready_to come wash dishes_in exchange for_food
what can i_recommend
all_of_it seriously
but_the creme of_the crop is
chicken_tikka_masala
the creamy_sauce with_the melt in_your_mouth chicken
drool
sooooooo good
the_owner_is the kindly gentleman with_the big white beard so_if_you see him tell him how wonderful his food_is and_his establishment
because_i always always see him working_there and all_that hard work has paid off_to blossom this_place into the_best_curry this_side_of india or pakistan hands down
i_do_not get_the hype here
the_food_was at_best average
it_is_not a_hole in_the_wall
and_it_is definitely_not fast_food
it is_just_a mediocre restaurant
the_food_was_so oily that_i_am pretty_sure it seeped through our plastic bag
we_ordered_the mixed vegetable_curry
the mushroom bhaji and_the tarka dhal
i honestly could_not taste much_as my_mouth was coated in oil
we_also waited minutes_and watched people who came_in after us get_their take away before us_and get served before while sitting down
no explanation
no apology for how long it_took and the_fact_that we_got frog jumped by everyone and_their mothers
the_lamb kebab was_ok
but coming_here was_my biggest regret of our_trip
erm
this_place_is_amazing
i've heard_about the kebab_mahal on_the edinburgh grapevine for_years
but for_some_reason i_never felt_the need_to_go there
but_now i_always feel the need_to_go there
because_the_food is_fantastic
and_oh
so cheap
this_is_not_a posh restaurant
oh no
it's formica tables_and stools and weird items stuffed up the_back_of_the room
there's even two parts to the_place
separated by_a proper wall and accessible only by going outside_and entering another main door
this_is what i_like_to call personality
me_and_my other half had_an incredible meal_here
in_the completely separate restaurant from everyone else
we_ordered_a starter of onion bhajis
three arrived the_size_of steering wheels
followed by_a veritable feast of_indian main_courses
i_opted_for two sides and_a_naan to keep_me filled and_the bloke opted for a_main course
rice
naan and_a_side
we_couldn't finish_it all and_took the_rest home
all_that wonderful_food only came_to
and_the_service_was good_too our_waiter_was pleasant_and we_even helped him shift some tables to_accommodate us
it_felt like_a mad family meal will absolutely
definitely
totally be_back_for_more
long live kebab_mahal
i_loved the_food_here
as they_say dont judge the book_by the cover
dont judge this_place by_the looks and_the board which boasts pizza and doner kebab on_it
the_food_is_good authentic_indian and_tandoori food cooked brilliantly and_is cheap
the_service_is_friendly and_of_course extra friendly for_me as_i could speak the language
the_saag panner was_excellent as_was_the bhindi_masala
the_samosa was_spicy_and the rotis were huge
tried the_special tea_and raas malai for_dessert and it_was_excellent
in_fact the_dessert was_the favourite part_of my_meal
all up_with three courses it_was quid for_two to_have dinner including drinks
not bad_for what_was a_big meal
i_would drop in_here regularly if_i_could
need a_cheap meal
then_this is_the_place_to_go
great sized curry_for was_yummy too
super unfriendly and unhelpful staff though
cleanliness of_the_place was_a_bit gross
our_table hadn't been wiped and floors looked_like they hadn't been mopped in a_year
on_our
me_and hubby
two day visit_to edinburgh
this_was_one_of_the_best finds
a_hole in_the_wall kinda restaurant
seems to_be_very busy_and dishes out absolutely lip smacking dishes_with ease
we_had_been to kebab_mahal twice_and both_the times_we loved_the_food
if_you_are one of_those people who prefer posh restaurants over good_food
then my_friend this_place_is not for_you
this_place looks more_like_a fast_food_joint but but but
the_food_is nothing_like fast_food
the two_times we_were here we_tried_the shammi kebab
chicken_tandoori
chicken bhuna
kharahi murgh accompanied with super yummy tandoori garlic_naan
all_the_dishes including the_naan was_absolutely_delicious
at_the_end after you_have stuffed yourself with these goodies
if you still have_any room left for_dessert do try_the baklava
best baklavas i_have_ever tasted
we_also_tried the almond cake which_was_also yummmm
delicious_food
excellent_service and_warm welcoming staff awesome gastronomic experience
this_place_has phenomenal indian_food
it's true to_the culture and very_authentic
try_it and_you'll be blown_away
i_must agree_with the_first reviewer
sensational indian
i_would_have given it_stars had_the dudes working_there at least cracked a_smile
i've been_there at least times_and not_even a twitch
great_food though and_only do takeaway
they've jumped a to_a stellar stars
not because_the_food rose to_another level as_i really_don't think_it possible
being top_of_the indian taste ladder as they_are
but because
wait_for it
i managed a joke with the_guy behind the_counter
finally
wonders never cease and_the delta indian_takeaway is_no
i_received
and binned
a_whole lot_of spam and flyers when_i moved into my_new flat
but made a_point to_save at_least_one of the_following
internet offers
pizza places
indian_take outs and italian restaurants
the_name_of this indian_restaurant_in_the west end definitely caught my attention
and_the flyer was_so fancy i_felt the_food couldn't be that_bad
other_than being a_restaurant
they're definitely marketing themselves as_a home delivery take_out
the_menu consists of pakoras and_samosas as starters
quite an_extensive list_of curries
many manyyyy side dishes_and_the typical rice_and bread accompaniments
i've_only had home delivery with the_indian cavalry club
i deviated from my_usual chicken_korma_and tried the_fried paneer
it's fried cottage_cheese
with pasanda curry
a_bit unusual at_first
but_it_was quite_good
i've had_a_little peek at the_restaurant_itself
an elegant looking place_and_i hope to_eat_there soon
as_for now
i'll be_on_the lookout for_some slightly cheaper indian_take outs for home delivery
despite the_fact_that there_are two indian_restaurants withing m of_my flat
this_place_is supposedly the_best place_to_get curry in_edinburgh
being a_big curry fan
i'm_a man who drinks beer_and watches football
of_course i_love curry
i_thought it'd be worth checking_out
luckily
i_have friends_who have birthdays and also_like curry
so_we_went on_one of said friend's birthdays
now i_love making curry myself
properly
not from_a jar
i get_my spices from kamco on south clerk st
you_should go the_samosas there_are amazing
and_i_like to_think i'm a_bit_of_a dab hand at curry
so_i'm rarely impressed when_i_go out for_one
this_place_just seemed_to get everything wrong
first of_all
we_had_to take_out a mortgage to_pay_for it
overpriced
that's_not the_word
rip off
when_you're paying upwards of_a head for_curry you_expect something pretty special
it_was_ok
but it_definitely wasn't special
it_was too_salty for_a start
and_the waiters_were rude_and unhelpful
they_seemed to_think they_were above me
which irked me
i'll not ever be_going back
and now_i owe northern rock a fortune
best indian_food_i've_ever eaten
service_was slow but_good
would highly_recommend_this to_anyone that likes indian
super resto indien
et je pense tre assez difficile
cadre chic
pas loin du centre
service correct
bon rapport qualit prix
tr s bons currys
bonnes sauces menthe et mangue

we_were_in edinburgh for a_few_days and staying at_the caledonian waldorf astoria hotel
which_is only_a_few mins walk_from this_restaurant
we_wanted_to have a_nice indian_meal
and_decided_to give_this_place_a try
that_was where_we went wrong
the concierge at the_hotel called ahead for_us
when_we_arrived at_the_restaurant
we_were_seated in the_front room
restaurant_is simple_and classy looking
and_it_was only about full
we_were given menus
and_ordered drinks right away
while_we_were placing our_food order
the_drinks arrived
out_of our_party of
one_person only wanted water
and_a_few of_us asked for_water also
it took_us mins plus to_order
as the_menu_is a_little complicated
and_they carry some untraditional items
we_ordered some starters and_also wanted some_rice with_them
this took time
the_menu said plain basmati_rice
when_we said we_want some plain basmati_rice
we_received some snotty comment about all_of_the rice dishes being basmati_rice
we finally_got the_waiter_to understand what rice we_wanted
at which point he questioned why we_wanted rice_with the_appetizers
we_want it
that's why
then came the_main_dishes
i_wanted some kheem
traditional_indian lamb_curry
waiter decided_to educate me on_what
kheema
is
then_he told_me that_they_had minced lamb
but wanted_to know what curry_sauce i_wanted it_with
i_asked
i_picked one_and he_told me_that i_should try something else
he_suggested another dish
which_i said i_don't enjoy
he_told us_that if_i_had it_in america
then_i should still try_it here
as americans don't know_how_to cook
of_us are american
so_this too did_not go over well
we_finally finished ordering and the_drinks arrived
no water
or glass_of ice
so_we asked_about it_and were_told to_be patient and that_it_was coming
a_little while later
our papad
poppodum
was_brought out
once we_finished with these
the_appetizers came out
they decided_to bring_out the_food without clearing the_table
so_we_had to_help clear the_plates
so they_had space to_put the_food down
we_had_ordered some chocked pakoras
masala_dosa
lamb kebabs and_a prawn an potato crepe
food_was_ok
nothing spectacular
when_the started were_brought to_the_table
we_asked_for more chutney
and specifically asked_for some tamarind and_some green chutney
half way through_the appetizers
we_stopped eating and_finally got_the attention of one_of_the waiters to ask_them about the_chutneys
as we_needed them to_eat out food
again were were dismissed rudely and_told it_was coming
waiters_were just standing around taking as not doing anything
this_was_the last straw
so_we told_them we_wanted to_see_a manager_and to cancel our_entrees
the_wait_staff told_us we could_not do_that as our_food_was already ordered
told_them to_get_a manager on_the_phone
after asking_for the_manager
our regular waiter came_by and_just started talking to_us as_if nothing had happened
i_stopped him and_told him again to_call the_manager_and to cancel our main_courses
we paid_for what_we_had consumed and_left
on_our way_out
we spotted another person_who said_that he_was one_of_the_owners
we spoke with him and_the_waiter for_a_few mins
but the_waiter_was just defensive and didn't_think he_had done anything wrong
we walked out_and went_to mother_india
avoid indian cavalry club at_all costs
service_is atrocious
and there_are_better ways to waste_your money_and
more importantly
time
we've got loads_of indian takeaways nearer to_us than_this
but we_always go_here
it's worth_the_trip
the_food_is_great
what more do you_need_to know
oh all right
the_chicken puri is_excellent it's a_starter
but_if_you don't_have_a huge appetite it's a_big enough portion to qualify as a_main
i_like their_lamb bhuna
spicy_enough to_have_a kick without making your eyes water
and_nice tender chunks_of lamb
this_is_one_of_my favourite restaurants_in_edinburgh
the_food_here really is_delicious
i_first heard_about it_when i_was_in first year_and on the_last day_of living_in halls we_decided_to treat ourselves to_some decent_food
ever_since
we_have always ordered_from shapla to_celebrate birthdays
end_of term or_any little event good_enough to_get an excuse to_get one
although the_restaurant describes itself as serving bangladeshi cuisine
you_will also find indian and_other asian dishes being_served up here
you_can_order online via their_website and_the delivery time_was about_half an_hour
which is_pretty_good
i_have_been trying_to work my_way through their_menu and_there hasn't been one meal where_i had finished it feeling dissatisfied
all_the meals are full_of_flavour and are_well portioned to ensure that you_are full by_the_end_of them
best indian_food_i've_ever_had
this_is straight takeaway
you_order
you_wait
you_get your_food
you leave
or you_could have_it delivered
whichever you prefer
they_give_you_a ton_of_food
one_dish could feed a_family
inexpensive
flavorful
and well_worth_the walk to_go get_it
i_tried three different_dishes
two different_types_of rice
two types_of nan_bread
and the_fried bananas
all_of it_was_good
spicy
and chalk full_of_flavor
all_of_the indian_food_i've_had and rated now seem second best
i_guess i'll_have to_go_to edinburgh again to_get_some
consistent quality_and service
love in_all_the details
big portions
complex flavour that_is made by someone who really understands cooking
i'm vegetarian_and they_always make_me extremely happy
even going so_far as to_make special dishes_for my fussy year old
love me_some shapla
this was_such_a disappointment
firstly
the_curry itself_was average at_best my tikka massalam was distinctly nippy
much spicier_than it ought to have_been
now i'm fine with heat but a_lot_of_people aren't and_you don't_expect a tikka massalam to_be hot
my boyfriend's passanda was so_so
it_wasn't just the_sauce
the_chicken_was dry too
just_not nice
and
worst of_all for_a poppadom lover like_me
i_received fewer than i'd ordered so i'd been shortchanged
when_i phoned to complain i_was fobbed off with_the explanation that the_kitchen doesn't get told how_many poppadoms people have_ordered
they_said to_mention next_time and_i'll get what_i ordered but i_won't_be ordering again
i_actually think i_ordered from_here a_few_months ago_and the_same_thing happened then
so_much for_being one_of_the_best_indian takeaways in_edinburgh
if_you_go to_edinburgh and you_want_to eat_indian
you_go here
the_food_is_so
so_much_better than indian_food_you can_get in america
and_also so so_much_better than any_other_indian place i_ate in_edinburgh or london
the_servers_are hilarious
especially the_main guy
who always teased me about_my orders and knew my name and culinary preferences by the_second_time i'd even been to_the_restaurant
if_i_lived in_this city
you'd bet i'd_be eating_here weekly
if_not nightly
gur balti is an_amazing indian_restaurant_on dundee terrace which consistently offers delicious food_and_great_service at_reasonable_prices
i've_been_here twice with_some friends_and both_times we've gone away more_than satisfied_with the_whole experience
they pride themselves on serving some_of_the_best_indian_food in_the_city and_each dish_is presented immaculately
the_menu_has loads to_choose_from_and the_last_time_i was_in i_went_for_the balti chicken passanda
it_seemed to_take no_time to_arrive and_tasted creamy with_a_great range_of flavours
all the_meat which they_use is of the_highest quality and_you_can definitely taste the_difference in_all their meat_dishes
we_all spent no more_than each
including drinks
rice_and tips
and we'll hopefully be_back sometime soon
my flatmates and i_have_tried various indian takeaways but we_always seem_to back_to_the guru because their_food_is simply amazing
balti as_good_as_it gets
and_the naan_breads are giant
it_may not_be the cheapest place_for_a takeaway but totally worth_every_penny
i_have_not eaten in_the_restaurant so cannot comment on_the service
we've been_to_the guru a_few_times but since_it's new refurbishment i_can_only say things have_only got better
the_food_has always_been great here_as the_other_reviewers remark but_it kind of lacked on the_decor before
i_was_pleasantly_surprised on_our latest visit
a_clean fresh modern look brings it bang up_to date and_the_atmosphere_is great
we_went_on_a friday_night and managed_to get_a_table but had_to_wait for_a_while before one was_available so best to book in_advance
i_had_a mixed kebab to_start which was_really_tasty
you_could taste_the barbecue flavour from_the clay_oven
the_waiter recommended_the guru special sauce instead_of the_regular sauce_and it_was_amazing
although not_for_the faint of heart as_it_is really spicy_but added another dimension of_flavour to_the dish
i_went_for a_chicken karahi main and_we shared_a garlic_naan together
if_you_want authentic naan_bread this_is_the_only place in_edinburgh i've been too that serve naan just_like india
i_mean they_are massive but_they_are thin perfectly_cooked without_the normal doughy bits you_get in other_places
the karahi was_excellent although way too_much_for me
service_is_great
relaxed and_friendly just the_way i_like_it
if_you_want indian in_edinburgh goto the guru
i_am of_indian heritage myself so for_me this_place serves the_best authentic_indian in_edinburgh
i_have_been_to the guru balti a_few_times
over several years
it_can_be summed up as offering good_quality meat_and above_average curry
though_the hotter dishes tend_to lack that real zing of back end heat
they_have_some of_the_best and biggest naan_bread though their_rice doesn't particularly stand_out
the_restaurant tends_to be fairly quiet through the_week
making_it a_good_choice for post cinema eating if you happen_to be at_the nearby cineworld
guru is a_good_choice for_an_indian meal_and if_you_live in_the_area it_should probably_be your indian_restaurant of_choice
when i_lived_in a flat off gilmore place_the bombay bicycle club was my_go_to indian_takeaway
so popular was_it with_my flatmates and_i that for_a_while i_would receive text messages on_the_way home that only read
'bombay
'
weirdly the delivery man would always arrive to the_door in_a full suit which made_us_feel especially guilty for slobbing out_with_a takeaway in_our pj's
no matter_what time_of day we_ordered_it always took them at least minutes to_arrive although_it_was always worth_it
byriani
sagg and red fort were our standard orders although_the dupiaza was_also pretty_good
three curries between four was easily enough in_fact
by_the_time_we got through_the bread_and rice we often had too_much
even_though_the restaurant_has had a_recent revamp i_would still find_it a_bit odd to_eat_in here
the seats all seem_to be pressed against the_windows and_i'd feel as though the_whole street was watching me
i've heard good_things about the_service but if_i was_going out for_curry i'd probably wander down the_road to gandhi's instead
great_for delivery but awkward to_sit_in
i'm not_really masterfully adept at recognising a_good_indian
my weak british mouth can't handle the_chilli and often leaves an unshakeable burning sensation for_the_rest my_meal
ultimately ensuring i_can't make head or foot of what_i'm eating
deciding to man up_and re kindle my_indian_food knowledge i_opted_for_the bbc's kashmiri curry_with a liberal dose of cobra beer
much to_my_surprise i_found i_could recognise each flavour rather than sweating the_spices away_and subsequently had_an enjoyable meal
reasonably_priced_and with_a cool name
i'll be_back_again
this great_little indian_restaurant_is located_in_the tollcross area_of the_city
like sam
i_have_a palette that prefers non spicy_food
so_i_ordered a_mild curry when_i visited here_for_a friend's leaving meal
it_wasn't at_all busy on_the night i_visited
the waiters_were vigilant
and it_did almost feel like_we were_being watched as we_sat and_ate the_meal
the_food_was_very tasty though
and appeared swiftly after_ordering
this_was no doubt helped by the_fact_that there weren't many customers
this_place didn't bowl me over like kismot
but_it_was_still a_good night_out with_some tasty_food
i_would_like_to go_back some_time
and_i suggest_you bear it in_mind as a_place worth visiting
i_had_the spiciest_curry ever in bombay bicycle club for_lunch one_day and i_don't_think my tongue has ever recovered
this_restaurant serves authentic indian_cuisine and_there_is_a really lovely_and homely feel to_the inside
situated in_the tollcross area_of edinburgh
bombay bicycle club is_just_a short walk_from the_city centre and_so it_is_a convenient place_to reach
their_lunch menu_is truly awesome
and_they_offer a_wide range_of indian_dishes
i_had_the onion_bhaji to_start which was_very_tasty followed by chicken with_a chili and_garlic curry_sauce
they_give little warnings next_to each_dish stating whether the_meal is mild or hot which_is handy
but_i paid no attention_to it and_went charging in_and ordered_a 'hot' dish_and boy was_it hot
the_curry_was really_delicious and full_of_flavour
but_my tongue had gone pretty numb after a_while from_the heat_and so_i couldn't taste much
i_feel i_should just warn you_that extreme caution ought to_be paid to the_menu when_you_are choosing your_meal and the_next_time_i go_here i_will_definitely play it safe and_order a_mild curry
bombay bicycle club serve tandoori_and biryani dishes
as_well_as_the more traditional curry's such_as madras
there_is_also a_good_selection_of vegetarian_dishes on_offer
takeaways are_also available here_and they_offer_a free home delivery service amazing
bombay bicycle club is_a fantastic curry_house and_one i_will_definitely_be going_back_to
so i_am_a notorious curry fiend
it's all_i want_to_eat
all_day long
and_i just_can't get_enough
all my_friends have learnt not to_get in_the way_of me_and_my curry
luckily edinburgh has curry_houses a plenty to_help me get_my fix
so_many in_fact that_it's easy_to_get overwhelmed and_just order_from your closest restaurant time_and time again
well
if_your closest restaurant is_not bombay bicycle club and you_haven't yet given it_a_go
you_must promise me you_will
i spent a_month this summer in_india giving in to_all my_curry cravings
and_when my_friends wanted_to_go for_an_indian days after i_was back in_edinburgh
i_was_really nervous about whether i'd enjoy_it
or whether comparisons with_the mother land would leave me_in tears
the bbc was_incredible authentic
full_of traditional spices_and serious about its menu
i_ordered_the marco polo chicken from the_chef's recommendations section of_the_menu
not_a traditional curry name i_know
but wait til you_eat you_just won't care
it_was rich
well_spiced
tangy and saucy
with beautifully marinated chicken strips which_were huge
all of_my_friends were similarly impressed_with what_they ordered so_much so no_one offered anyone else a_taste
being so_happy and protective of_their own
the_restaurant_itself_is bright_and light
and_the_service_was fine
nothing_to rave about
but_the_food most certainly is
it's_not_the cheapest curry on_the block
with traditional curries being at least for chicken_and_the chef's specials
but_the taste_and ingredients are definitely_worth splashing out_for
we_visited bombay bicycle club last_week
as a_year anniversary hurrah
following up_with_some good old fringe fun
i've passed this_place_so many_times but_never managed to_make_it in
as_most of_my stories start
i swear
when_i say_this
i_mean it it's_been a_good years
i_am_not entirely convinced it_was_worth_it
i started_with vegetable_samosas that looked_like they_came out_of costco pretty forgettable
the boy's prawn puri looked much_more
and_tasted
much better_than my option it's normally my staple
so i_was_pretty envious as_i looked_at my sad samosas
for_the_main
the boy went_for_the marco polo chicken which_he devoured happily
and_i had_the_tandoori trout
lovely seasoning on_the trout
but cooked a_little_too dry
we_also shared_the afghan chickpeas
which were_pretty delicious as_an accompaniment
naan_was too_dry and toasted
now
i've given it two_stars
for why
well
food wise
while the_main was_pleasant
the_starter i_had_was just
eh
i_need_to find a_better word for eh
but_at the_moment
that's all_i_can come up_with
the_mains were pleasant
but_in terms_of comparing to another_restaurant
it_isn't food_that stands out_as memorable
or particular adept at handling the flavours that_can_be oh_so amazing or delivered with_a blunt hammer
so_it would_be_a star_for that
i drop down_to two because_i thought the_service_was_pretty lame
very disinterested
and when_you_are trying_to call the_waiter back because he's wandered off halfway through taking your_order
that_isn't a sign_of good_service
really
if you_think that_is
then_we need to_have_a conversation
and_doesn't inspire the_whole tipping thang
y'know
i'm at_a loss for_all_the praise
as_i didn't_really experience something_that blew my_mind
more something_that was_more mundane than we_would_have liked
very_good_food here
living_in naples
we_don't get_that many varieties
so we're happy_to travel anywhere and branch outside italian cuisine
this made_us happy
it_was crowded on_a_saturday
but_they fit us into_a snug spot
only flaw was_that our_appetizer came out a_little cold on_the_inside
never a_good_sign
they_were apologetic and gave_us_a second with another free appetizer
the_entrees of_curry
masala
and_tandoori were_all excellent
we_ordered takeaway from bbc this evening
i_had great difficulty ordering on_the_phone
and the_order arrived a_bit wrong
i rang them up expecting them_to jump to fix it
firstly they_just said sorry
and_left it_at that_i had_to_ask what_they were_going_to do to fix it expecting either off the_next order
a refund of_the_items i_didn't_want wihtout the accompaniment
or them_to send the_stuff straight round
we_live a min drive from the_place
instead they told_me i_was now at the_back_of_the queue for delivery
when_they should_have fixed the mistake first
and_would have_to_wait minutes_for my missing items
the item_was mango_chutney for poppadoms_and i_didn't_want them without_it
i_also wanted them before the_curry so_i asked_for_a refund instead
the_guy seemed annoyed
but said fine
he_then rang up after to_say they wanted the poppadoms back when_i_got my refund
so back they went
the already touched
already out_of_the bag poppadoms
i_really hope someone notices that before_they try and_eat them
a_takeaway meal_for with average curry ruined by a_bad telephone manner
bad customer_service
and_the thought
thethought
that_they_have re served poppadoms to people
shudder
ps try pataka on causewayside or kismot on st leonards street
much nicer service
same_price range
visited may
if you're wanting a relatively cheap_and satisfying indian_take away meal
clerk street is_the_place_to_go
however
roti restaurant_is in whole other league
it's_a successful attempt at fusing quality scottish ingredients with_indian recipes
the_menu_has the_usual dishes you_would_expect at_an_indian_restaurant
but_if_you take_a closer look you'll see they've tried to_make them more unique
also what_i call trying_to justify the_prices
for example it's possible to_have haggis samosas
salmon filled naan
defininitely a first
and for_dessert indian carrot cake
the main_dish menu is_a_little bit_more traditional and_doesn't stray too_much from curries
the tiffin for_a tenner option seems pretty_cool
it's basically tins filled_with different foods
and_there_are vegetarian
meat_and fish options
the_decor_is quite fancy and contemporary
making_it nice for a_special night_out
as a_student living alone
i_get take aways regularly
then_i get annoyed because_my bum isn't getting any smaller
probably something to_do_with the take aways that i_don't stop_eating until a
it's finished and b
i_feel sick
but noor seem_to_have the solution
their portions_are quite small perfect_for one_person
when_i first got food from_here
chicken_korma
really creamy_and delicious
i was_kind_of disappointed_by what seemed_like little amount_of_food i_was given
but turns out it_was_perfect
they_have_a really extensive_menu
it_all looks delicious
i'm a_spice pussy though
so_i_don't tend_to go_for_the spice
but_i'm told it's_really good_too
they deliver too
which_is_great
they_are even part_of just eat
co
uk so_you don't_even have to_pick_up the_phone
order online
i_really_like noor
the_food_at noor_is pretty great_and as already explained by emily t
the_portions_are perfect_for if_you_want_a guilt free pig out_of delicious_indian_food in_a one_person banquet
anyway
the_food_here_is great if a_little over_priced in_my_opinion
especially in_comparison to_other_indian take aways in_the_area
dont write it_off yet though while other_places are cheaper
they lack the authenticity and generaly very hight quality_food that noor offers
choose wisely
noor_is totally deserving of my_first star_review
and_you'll now see why
whenever_i want an indian_takeaway
there_is only one_word on_my lips noor
for the_past few years
it_has stood out for_me as_a purveyor of some_of edinburgh's finest takeaway food
i totally agree_with what jonathan said
there_are cheaper places
but they_don't quite measure up
all_of_the_food i_have_ordered from noor has_been top_notch
i_tend_to go_for_the less spicy end_of_the spectrum
so stick_with kormas and bhunas
occasionally stepping up_to a tikka_masala or rogan_josh
all_of_the_food has_been tasty_and flavoursome
something which can_be lacking_in some takeaways
the_menu_has a_good_variety
and_the online ordering service means that_you don't_even have_to leave_the comfort of_your sofa
delivery has_always been_on time
and_the_food has_been piping_hot
it's_so difficult_to communicate the_warm feeling that noor gives in my_stomach
before eating
even_the mention of_a noor curry starts the saliva production
i command everyone to_enjoy the awesomeness that_is noor
noor_is definitely up_there as one_of_my favourite takeaways
they_serve really traditional and_authentic indian_dishes which_are of excellent quality
noor's menu_has a vast selection_of fine indian_food which are_very well_priced at_around six pounds for a_main meal and_you_can see the_chef's preparing your_meal in_the_back
i_love their_chicken_tikka buhna which_is full_of_flavour and_spices
they_also have met menu's available which include starters
a_main and_rice for_just under seven pounds per_person
they_also_have_a wide_variety_of vegetarian meals which_are priced_at under five pounds for a_main course
noor offer_a home delivery service which_i have_always found to_be extremely efficient and you_can_order either on line
by phone
text or by popping into the_shop itself
the_food_is cooked fresh on_the premises and it_only takes about_minutes after_ordering for_your food_to_be ready
they_are_open until midnight seven days a_week so_it_is great_place_to stop buy for decent meal on_your way back from_a night_out
noor_is an_excellent indian_takeaway which offers quick
friendly_service and excellent_food
i've_eaten from_here twice with_my flatmates and_on both occassions we_were far_from disappointed
the menu_is_extensive with a_huge range_of authentic_indian dishes taken from all_over_the country
i_had_the lamb_rogan_josh the_first_time_and it_was_amazing with_a delicious blend_of flavours_and a_good_amount_of heat running through it
the portion_size wasn't huge
but certainly hit_the_spot
we delivered the_second_time and i_went_for_the tandoori_chicken kebabs which_were seriously spicy
yet also tender
the delivery time was_almost negligible it_was_so fast_and the_whole meal between four_of us came_to under
i'd_definitely recommend noor if_you're_in_the area
you simply cannot beat noor indian_takeaway
the_food_is_delicious enough_to make_you rejoice for_being human and having_the ability_to appreciate such things
noor_is located just_a_few doors down the_road from_my flat
and_as such
i_have quickly become a_regular
my_friends_and_i always_get_the set meals
which include a_choice_of
golden oldies
curries
all_the classics such_as korma
rogan_josh
dopiaza
madras
bhuna and
my_personal favourite
dhansak
along_with rice_or naan
five vegetable_pakoras along_with some salad and_sauces
what more could you_want
all_for six to seven pounds per_person
depending on how_many of_you there_are
the absolute beauty of noor_is that_the_food tastes great and_the_portions_are very_generous
one portion_of curry usually lasts me for_my tea that_night as_well_as_a very satisfying lunch the_next_day
as_it provides at least two meals
it certainly offers great value_for_money
the_pakoras are wonderfully crispy also
and_for an_extra you_can_order a_bag of ten that_are worth_every_penny
due_to my close vicinity
i_have always collected my orders in person and i_have_never_been kept waiting_for than minutes
if you prefer it_to_be delivered to_your door
they_will do_so for_only
although_i cannot comment on_the speed of delivery
overall
if_it's an_indian you're after
look no further
you have_found something heavenly
noor was my_indian of_choice for_the_first two_years of_my uni life
and_while now_i will occasionally stray from it
i'll always end_up crawling back
the_curries_are huge
well_cooked and_really cheap
although they_are arguably not_as sophisticated as many_other curry_houses
they_still make_a mean dopiaza and friends
found on nicholson street it clearly caters to students and_the_prices reflect this
you_can_get_a meal deal_with a_curry and rice_or nan for
and_one will more_than fill all but but_the fattest of fatties
as_well as_this they and a_la_carte_menu
with_all_the normal curries and_a_few specialities
the_sauces are_great
really creamy_and rich without being over the_top
all_the traditional curries_are done exceptionally
and whilst i_am yet to_sample their specialities i_look_forward_to it
they also_do all_the sides you_could want
with a_variety_of nan breads
and pakoras
bhajis
samosas etc for vvery reasonable_prices
the_staff_are really_nice
and the_service_is_very quick
combine this with excellent_food and_that's a_winner in_my_book
me_and_my mate ordered_from noor takeaway last firday
i_was advised from a_couple_of friends that_it_was_a great_place_to_go to_and the_reviews_on here looked great_too so_i though that_i_would go_for_it
we_ordered online
where we_were_able_to choose the time_for which we_wanted it_to_be delivered and_they_were on time which_was_a good start
i ordered_a_chicken ceylon
which i_had_never had_before and_tasted a_spicy korma
the_only criticism of_it that_i_could find was_that there_wasn't enough chicken although_it_was lovely_and tender
the_portions that_you_get are_great and me and_my_friend couldn't finish_it all so_we put what we_couldn't finish into_the fridge and_ate it the_next_day
we also_ordered papadums and naans
and_both_were delicious
this_is definitely_one_of_the best_curry restaurants_in_edinburgh and_the_prices_are pretty reasonable too
just discovered_this_place
extraordinarily good_food_and very friendly_staff
even_though_it is_a take away
we_sat at one_of_the tables_and enjoyed_our curries
highly_recommend
though named takeaway
there_are three tables inside to_eat_at as_well
we_tried_the set meal_for two and_were very_happy_with the choices all_of_the items_were very_tasty_and fresh
the_only
complaint
we_could_have is_that_it was_simply way too_much_food
very friendly_staff and_great_food
my new_favorite takeaway
we've lived on_the the southside of_edinburgh for nearly two_years and somehow had overlooked noor
our loss
noor provides an outstanding product
with_good customer_service
at very reasonable_prices
saag_paneer is_my very fave curry
so_that's how_i judge most_indian_places
their's is superb just spicy_enough and the_spinach not pureed
great pakora_and naan
the_chicken_korma is very_mild
working our_way through the_menu
on_the last_visit i_had placed a_large order that was_not ready when_i_arrived to collect it
a tech glitch had prevented the order_from being uploaded and_i had_to_wait about_minutes
without asking
was deducted from_the total and_a litre of coke added
very thoughtful
i_love noor
the_chicken shajani is_the_best curry i_have_ever_had and i_used_to go_in there_at least once per week
unfortunately
i_am no_longer in_edinburgh so_i_can not get_my noor fix
i_have_been searching_for something even half as_good as their shajani but_i've not_been successful in_my search so_far
i kind of wish i_had_never found_this_place but_i_guess it's better to_have loved and lost than to_have never loved
or_something like_that
the_portion_sizes are_good
the_staff_are friendly and_the_food_is really_tasty
noor_is a quality takeaway with a_small eating area
tables
and_a kitchen you_can see while waiting_for your_food
the_curries_are fresh
the_nan light_and the_pakoras and samosas_are crisp_and delicious
basically exactly what_you_want in_indian_food
the_staff_are friendly_and happy_to serve the_food_at the_tables
if_you_want to_sit_in and the_food_itself is_great
so if_you_are_in_the area give_it_a try
this_is now my_favourite take away_and has overtaken the mighty kasbah for_me
i_left this a_while before reviewing as_i often ended up_in here_on the_wrong side_of a night_out and_everything is_great when_you_are half cut
food goggles i_guess ha
d
anyway fast forward a_few_months and_i_have popped in_here a_half dozen times or_so and_the_food_is consistently amazing
the_staff_are really fiendly and_the delivery service_is quick
the_restaurants decor_is functional and_the seating_area is_quite comfy with_some leather sofas or an area to_sit_in and dine
often while_waiting we recieve complimentary poppadoms_and pickles while_we wait
there_are_a few stand_out curries on_the_menu for_me from_what i_have_tried sabzi chilli dal
hurri mirchi vegetables_and the_vegetable persian were_great and_get reordered each time we_go
the_veg pakoras are worth_a mention in that_they_are great_quality and_there_are loads_of them
also served_in_a brown paper bag
first_time_i had pakora it_was presented this_way so in my_head its how they_should be_served
lastly try_the roti boti
tandoori_chicken wrapped in roti bread
these_are amazing
noor is_a_great option if_you_are after some tasty indian_food
i_ordered_the set meal_for two
the lamb_dishes were_both well_cooked
nicely spiced and_very_tasty
the_amount_of_food which arrived was_more_than advertised
myself_and my flatmate struggled to finish_it
which_is unusual for_us
noor_is in_my_opinion
the_best_indian take away ever
i_was_a regular here when_i_was in_edinburgh first for_the good_price but_they i realised how delicious the_food_was
i_always recommend_it_to friends travelling through as_well
the_portions and amount of condiments are_generous and_the ceylon curry_is my absolute favourite
i_eat_here every_time i'm back in_edinburgh and_always find_it just_as amazing as before
i_don't often give_stars
however noor has earned them
this_is my_go_to takeaway when_it_comes_to curry
the_only better curry_is from kismot
which_is_a restaurant
imo
not_only_is it great curry
it_is_great value as the_portions
particularly with_the set meal
are_large
i_have worked my_way through half the_menu_and am yet to_find_a curry which_isn't fresh_and_tasty
i_have even bought the set meal_for two occasionally
so_i_can eat curry_for two_days as_the_food easily tastes as_good re heated the_next_day
the chicken_madras
vindaloo or hurri mirchi are_my favourites however this_is_one_of_the few_places i_have enjoyed_the milder creamier curries from
in_short if you fancy an indian_takeaway then noor_is highly_recommended
the food_was_tasty and_good
we_had_the lamb_rogan_josh
highly_recommended
and_the chicken_madras with ginger naan
the_only_place i've_found making this variety_of naan
with onion_bhaji
papadom and pilau_rice
service_was fast
portions_were big
the_meal_was meant for_two but_we_were so full after a_while that_we kept the_rest for breakfast the_next_day
if you're craving good_indian_food where portions_are generous_and prices_are okay
this is_the_place_to_go
if_i didnt have tummy issues after eating_here it_would easily be a_star
but the_fact_that i_do get tummy issues but_still keep_coming back means that maybe it_is star food
its cheapness makes_it seem that_much tastier
i_will stick_with a_star only cause there_is no indoor seating
you_can sit outside at long picnic tables outside
under_a tent thingy or_just get takeaway
its_good
and_you_get a_lot_of it
there_are brave people eating here_in_the winter but i_am_not one_of_them
they change their_menu every_day
you_walk_in to a_small room
wait in_a usually short line
pick out any number_of their around options differing daily that_are looking_at you so_you_can see whats up even_if_you dont know whats in_it
wait_for it
get_it takeway or join some randoms and inhale
i_hate to_use the_word authentic
cause i_dont give_a shit if something is_authentic
if i_like_it i_like_it
but_if_you_are one of_those people who likes to only eat authentic
ive been told this_is authentic as authentic can_get
my_brother lived in_edinburgh for several years_and took_me here_when i_came_to visit for a_few_days
i_love a_lot_of things in_edinburgh but_this_was definitely top three stops
enormous
delicious plate_of vegetarian_food for_less_than i paid_for any_other meal on_the trip
eating_it out back at_the picnic tables on a_lovely day was tops
a_friend took_me here_for_a cheap dinner when_i visited him a_few_years ago
i_think we_went_back at least twice more in the_week i_was_there
we_would_have probably gone every_day if we_hadn't been restrained only by_our mutual guilt at eating_there so often
the_curry is_absolutely fantastic
cheap
and lavishly portioned
that plus a_little cheap tesco naan
i'm_sure their own naan_is better
but_we_were cheap bastards
made_for a_delicious and_filling meal
the_ambiance_is a_bit lacking
so just order_for takeaway and enjoy_it elsewhere
be_sure_to hold it with_both hands
if_it weren't
miles away from_me
this_would probably_be a weekly meal
tucked_away down_a subtle side street entrance
the_mosque_kitchen is a_hidden haven for hearty indian_cuisine
serving locals
students and_even the business elite
the luring smell_of home_cooked
honest indian_fare attracts all
offering_a limited but exceptionally affordable array_of dishes
the_mosque_kitchen produces some simple but flavoursome gems
vegetarians can enjoy a_truly moreish tarka dahl or_a flavoursome spinach_and potato curry
whilst those_of a_more meaty persuasion can indulge in one_of_the mosque's daily chicken_or lamb servings
with_the offering of_rice
plain or garlic_naan to accompany each_dish
diners can anticipate a_meal that satisfies any level_of hunger
a word_of warning
though
diners can expect_to feast on humble trestle tables
shelter under_a rustic corrugated roof and mingle amidst a_friendly bunch_of pigeons
meek and unassuming
the_mosque_kitchen boasts unbeatable prices
food of_a superlative nature
and_will undoubtedly leave you comfortably stuffed for the_day ahead
there_are few_places anywhere that_you will_find a_curry for
but right here_at the_mosque_kitchen you_can_eat your heart out_for next_to nothing
i_love_the canteen feel
the outdoor picnic table seating
the paper_plates and the_plastic spoons
it_doesn't have_to please aesthetically just_to pull in_the punters the_people of_edinburgh know a_good curry when_they eat_it and_this_is why the_mosque_kitchen is_so popular
absolutely great with_a_big bunch_of friends on_a summers evening
brilliant if you're skint or_if you_just can't_be bothered cooking as_the generous portions will fill you_up no problems
it's_also the_kind_of place you_could just_go and sit on your_own tucking into some curry_and doing a spot of_people watching
little independent places_like this are_great and i_highly_recommend visiting
the_vegetable_curry is my_favourite
it's nice_and_spicy just the_way i_like_it
brilliant
a no frills eating venue which_has begun to_take on_an almost legendary status
the_mosque_kitchen is_a dining_experience quite unlike any_other in_the_city
if_it's luxury
ambience
or_even proper cutlery you're after
you won't find_it here
if however it's_a tasty curry_at frankly unbelievably cheap prices you_want
then that's exactly what you'll get
i'm_so carnivorous i'd happily feast on_a roadkill rabbit by_the side_of_the motorway
so i_was_pretty surprised to_find it_was_the vegetable_curry
with_all sorts of greenery thrown in
that_was my_favourite
i_expect i'll be a_regular visitor here though
so_that may change
it's places_like this that_really give_a city it's character
and_i'd much rather give my hard earned to_the people_of the_mosque than many_of_the city's more unscrupulous curry_house owners
i urge you to_do the_same
if you only_have
in_your pocket and_want a_meal that's_a
tasty_and b
enormous
preferably with a_bit_of 'character' thrown in
this_is where you_should head
by 'character'
i_mean you_sit outside under_a gazebo in_the backyard of_edinburgh central mosque
and you_eat out_of_a polystyrene box with_a plastic fork
but_the_food_is that_good that_you won't care_about the pigeon eyeing up our_lunch feet away
i_usually_go for the_veggie option
because_the one_time i_did get_the_chicken there_were quite a_lot_of fatty chewy bits
in_fact
it made_me stay away from_here for_a_while
but_then a_veggie friend convinced me to_get_the lentil and spinach_curry instead
and years later i'm_still eating_there
it's_right by_the uni
but you_get_a surprsing mix_of people thanks_to it's word_of mouth reputation
if you_haven't tried_it yet
then you_need_to
soon
i_cant believe i_lived across the_road from_this_place for nearly a_whole year_and didnt try the_mosque_kitchen
it_was recommended to_me
and frankly i didnt fancy it_but i_was_there today and_i_am now kicking myself that_i didnt take advantage while_i still could
the_food_is_great
it's propper indian_pakistani food
and_more importantly there_is absolutly loads_of it_for a_very tidy price
eating outdoors is also_great
and gives this_place_a great vibe
i_really will_be here_again
this_place should definitely_be kept on_the down low because_it_is frickin awesome
i_really fancied curry the_other day_and remembered seeing_the raving reviews_on_yelp and_thought i_would give_it_a bash
the simplicity of this_restaurant might put you_off at_first but_it_is fantastic
real
authentic_food and at_a stupidly cheap price
never has eating out_a box been so_good
i_will return_to this_place_again and_again because_it_is just that_good
in_the scotsman newspaper placed the_mosque_kitchen top of_its list_of best festival food and_it's clear to_see why
their_curries are authentic
slow cooked
flavoursome and sold in generous portions
i_have_been twice
both_times having the_chicken_curry with_rice_and_a naan_bread which was_tasty_and filling
to_order your_food you simply walk past the eating area_and into a_small room where_you order your curry canteen style and_then eat_it off_a plastic plate
for_vegetarians there_are a_variety_of vegetable curries_and these
along_with_the meat_and poultry ones
are_all served_with rice for_less_than
the_service_is_friendly and effective and i_like_the eating arrangement where_you take_your food outside_and eat_it under the_plastic roof while chatting with_your mates
the_mosque_kitchen offers genuine value_for_money and_is visited each day by people from a_huge range_of ethnic and national backgrounds and for_good reason too
nearly every student has heard_of the_mosque_kitchen
there_is_a reason for_that
situated near george sq in_the centre of_town
the_mosque_kitchen is_a canteen esque restaraunt attached to_the edinburgh mosque
this where students come to_fill_up with big portions_of cheap curry
don't_be put_off though
cheap does not mean poor quality
the_mosque_kitchen serves a_small range_of curry every_day
there_is usually a_small selection
that_can_be accompanied with_rice with_some side servings such_as nan
food_is dished up into polystyrene dishes_and eaten with plastic cutlery
but make no mistake
the_curry is great_quality and_the_portions very_reasonable
regular attendees appreciate the_lack_of fuss made over_the presentation
they_are here for_what the_kitchen sets out to_do
provide great curry_for all
the_mosque_kitchen has_a communal feel and expects to_have_some great chat
especially_if_you come regularly
sitting at one_of_the_few long
school cafeteria type tables
if you're visiting edinburgh_and you_want_to see where_the locals
especially_the students
eat out
or you are_looking_for somewhere less pricey to_fill_up for the_day
try the_mosque_kitchen
if_you_live in_edinburgh and you_haven't been
why_not
this_place_is brilliant
nothing more to_say
well
ok i'll go_on
it_doesn't look_like much_to people walking past and_you'll not_be the_first to_walk past it
but_if_you go_in you'll never want_to_go anywhere else
the offer huge dishes_for next_to nothing
the_food_is_delicious_and the_people there_are beyond wonderful
it_feels_like you're getting_a cuddle every_time you're_in here
it's a_total diamond in_the rough
only tell your best friends
the_mosque_kitchen is_a_great addition_to_the curry scene in_edinburgh
unlike many traditional curry_houses that serve bland
mass produced masalas etc
the_mosque_kitchen has traditional muslim food_that
i_have_been assured by_my arabic friends
is_what they_do eat
the_place itself_is beautifully grubby
you_go into a_little kitchen
queue up like in_a school canteen then head off outside onto plastic chairs and tables all under a_big gazebo
there_is nothing refined about the_location
the_kitchen relies on_its food
and the_food_is_really
really_good
there_are only curries
chicken_and_lamb
and_while the_lamb can_be quite stringy
the_chicken is_always excellent
think a korma but less sauce_and much_more subtly spiced
they also_do daal
some form_of spinach dish_and other_dishes i_don't recognise as_well as kofta kebabs
the_rice_is absolutely_amazing
and the_nan breads are_huge
although the_price has gone up a_wee bit recently
the_mosque_kitchen is_still the cheapest curry place around
with_a curry_with rice_or nan costing only
and the_other_dishes less
the_guys who work there_are really_friendly
and_it_is a_great establishment to_give your money to
the_mosque_kitchen lies just behind edinburgh central mosque and offers food_at unbeatable prices where_the money you_pay goes to worthy causes
i_have_been_here a_good few_times
and_i_must_say that the_last_time_i went
i_was_a_bit disappointed_by_the naan_bread
and thought_it_was_a bit_dry
but_it_is the festival period and_i came late in_the day
so perhaps this may_have had something to_do_with it
even_if this_was_a common occurrence
i_would_probably still give_this_place stars
as the_curry tastes divine and_the_portions will fill you_up no matter how hungry you_are
if you_do not_want_to fork out_on extra money on drinks there_is_a water fountain just outside the_kitchen area and_there_are cups where you_can_have this water instead
a_couple_of very minor criticisms of_the_place is_that there_are lots_of pigeons who pester you during your_meal while you_sit under_the gazebo and they_only supply a spoon rather than_a knife and fork
other_than this
it's great
there aren't many_places in_edinburgh that_can_be this
this_is_the_best
place
in
edinburgh
ever
i_have friends_who come_back_to visit and refuse to_leave without stopping at the_mosque_kitchen first
i'm_not talking about people who'd never been here_before
though
word does get around
but people who lived in_edinburgh for_a_while and counted on the_mosque_kitchen to cure their disproportionate hangover
i_always_get_the vegetarian_options
which have multiplied lately
which_are dahl
rice
greasy spinach with_potatoes
chickpeas
and_sometimes a vegetable_curry
and_i_think they're definitely_the_best and cheapest options available
the_mosque_kitchen also sells rubicon and_delicious ginger beer to quench your thirst
the_people who work there_are also real sweet too
do_i really feel this_place needs another star_review
no i_do_not
do i_think_that there's anything i_can_say_that hasn't already been said
no i_do_not
chaise lounge monkey fist
i stand corrected
ok
so_this probably isn't news by now
but listen
they_give_you_a lot_of_food for_not a_lot_of cashmoney
you've heard that before
right
will_get you tarka dal
lentils
and_rice
sheesh kebabs and rice_or a_few_other options that escape me right_now
i_have likely been_there about or times by now
because you_can't beat the_price
and you_can't beat the_portions
fantastic
delicious
well portioned
fast
inexpensive food
served in_the_back of_a mosque
for a_wonderful steaming chicken_curry dish that_will fill you_up
unlike so many_places around here
the_garlic_nan bread_is also_delicious
except i'm usually too full to_eat_it
the_only_downside to_this amazing place is_that_the seating is outdoors under_a tarp
so_if it's_a windy and cold day you_should either bundle up or get_it to_take away_and eat_it somewhere warmer
it_was okay
for_curry
rice
veggies_and a_drink isn't bad
it's_just_not the_most aesthetically pleasing restaurant
as has_been said
you're sitting outside under_a tarp on cafeteria style benches
floodlit and surrounded by mossy walls
they_have three choices of_curry
vegetarian
chicken
or
meat
this concerned me greatly as to_what the_chicken_was if_not meat
but_i digress
anyway
i_was after_the
meat
but_they sold out so i_went_for_the chicken
i'm_not sure_what part_of_the chicken they_used but_it seemed_very fatty
pretty_tasty though
and for_the asking price
still pretty_good
had another funny conversation with the_guy behind the_counter after_the
meat
no meat
chicken
conversation
i_asked_if he_had any garlic_naan
he looks at me_and goes
naan
pause none
have_to get_in earlier next_time_i guess
went_to the_mosque_kitchen for_the_first_time after a_year away travelling
i_have_to_say it_was_one_of_the two_things i missed while_i_was away
kopperberg was the_other
and_i_was worried it might_have changed
maybe the_prices had gone up
maybe they_don't do lamb anymore
maybe_the pigeons had killed everyone in_a fit of impulsive hunger and taken over_the little yard behind the_mosque
making_it a death trap for_the students and locals of newington
thankfully none_of_the above had in_fact happened
although
inevitably
there_was one niggling negative upon my return
and_that_was the_great big 'mosque kitchen' sign over_the archway
this kitchen_is edinburgh's best kept secret and should really stay that_way if we_want to_enjoy the_portions
the_price_and the_level_of service_from the_lovely folk that run the_place
same_thing happened_to kfc and_that place_is extortionate now
okay i_can't back that up
other_than_that
i_got_the ground minced lamb rather than_the big chunky lamb
bit_of_a surprise but_still great
chicken's still the_chicken
winner
love_this_place
first found_out about_it through_a muslim friend last year_and was so_happy that_day
for you_get_to fill your tummy with delicious spicy goodness and_a_nice cool beverage to wash it_all down
very_good price for_the_amount_of_food you_get
it's nothing fancy
just_a kitchen with_an eating area outside covered by tarp
i_don't_really care_about fancy restaurants or_anything
so_i_was perfectly happy to_eat outside
as_far as_i'm concerned
as long_as we're not getting rained on
it's all_good
great_food
great value_for_money
and_i recommend them to_anyone_looking_for tasty_and tongue tingling food_at_a competitive price
good_for a_bowl_of tasty hot
cheap
quick vegetarian_food
don't_go expecting a_restaurant
i_enjoyed my_curry and_rice
hmph
i_think i_was_expecting much_more from mosque_kitchen than_what was delivered
saag aloo that had_been cooked_to death
somehow the_potato remained semi raw
cold chicken_and average tarka daal
massive portions yes
perfect_for starving students looking_for_a change_from greggs
but_for a_couple_of quid more
you_can_get_a lot better
definitely disappointed_in this_one
i_can't_believe i_have_been yelping for a_year and_still haven't reviewed the_mosque_kitchen
ok here_it goes
hungover
like cheap curry
in_a_hurry
then mosque_kitchen_is for_you
i_really_enjoy mosque_kitchen when it_isn't freezing outside
it's outdoor seating although_i hear they_made an indoor seating
nevertheless
be it sun or snow this_food will most certainly warm you_up from_the inside
a_great choice_for some affordable grub at very substantial portions
you_can mix and match the_mains if_you_can't decide on_a specific curry
their_garlic_naan is particularly tasty also
be_warned that lunch times can_be very_busy as_well as swooping pigeons
great_food at great_value
great_for students
or tourists on_a budget
huge helping for lunch_or_dinner for_only
i_got_the_chicken curry
with_rice_and_a samosa
extra
and_it_was such_a big helping that_even i_couldn't finish_it
says a_lot
the only_complaint i_have about the_mosque is_that when_i_went they_weren't serving drinks anymore
i_mean like water
juice
it_was closed
my_friend ended_up_going to_ask specifically and_got herself a_bottle_of water
but it_seemed kinda overpriced
definitely if you're on_a budget
this_is_a great_place_to_go good_value_for your dollar
and a_huge
and_delicious
helping
having been recently introduced to the_mosque kitchen's new indoor restaurant
i've been a_bit_of_a glutton and visited three_times in_the_last month or_two
i_really love_this_place
the_food_is cheap
filling and incredibly tasty
the_menu_is quite limited
but_what it lacks in variety it more_than makes up_in_the yum stakes
there's enough on_offer for meat_eaters and_veggies alike to_be satisfied
you_can_get_a large plate_of lentil dhal and_rice for and_a freshly made nan_bread for
other_things on_offer include a spinach dish
vegetable_curry
lamb_curry and_chicken_curry
as_well as garlic nans
samosas_and a_few_other bits and pieces
portion_sizes_are large_and very enjoyable a_bit_of_a rarity in_edinburgh these days
don't_expect airs and graces
the_place_is canteen style and_you'll be_eating your grub off paper_plates with plastic cutlery
the_decor_is clean_and contemporary
with long tables happily accommodating ten people or_more
the_food_is served buffet_style and_the_service_is quick but_a_little abrupt
i_was_told that the_mosque kitchen's profits go towards funding the_mosque and_that the_staff_are volunteers
so_i'm_not surprised_that the_service can sometimes be_a_little lacking_in finesse
that's the_only_reason i'm_not giving_it stars
if_you_want something sweet to round off your_meal
cakes and pastries are available starting at_around
brilliant value_for_money
fab food_and_a nice_atmosphere make for_a_great bit_of budget dining in_the_city
this_place along_with their newly established mosque cafe on clerk nicholson st way
is_good quality_food for a_great_price
however
i_wish_they would use true cutlery and plates instead_of the styrofoam they_still use in_the cafe
it_just doesn't suit the establishment and isn't friendly all_around
the newer cafe is cleaner than the_mosque environs where_you had to_eat outdoors under_a covered area with pigeons flying about
overall
it_is_great for_the_food
cheap_and cheerful indian_food
much paper plate_and plastic fork charm
we summed it_up as
an unmissable edinburgh lunch spot that represents excellent bang for_your buck
if you've not been_there
go
and_if_you haven't been for_a_while
go_back_and sample it_again
you won't_be_disappointed
came_here a_few_weeks_ago with_friends and enjoyed_the_food but the_place_was absolutely packed
i_guess that's what_you_get for coming around lunch_time near uni
the_food_was_good_and the_price_was definitely nice
you_get huge portions
i_did feel that my_dish was_a_little_too oily buttery though and considering there_is indian_food_on nearly every corner in_edinburgh
i_wasn't too impressed_with it
perfect_for students on_a budget though
this_place_was awesome
it's about_as hole in_the_wall as it_gets
the_food_is_awesome and entirely authentic
i_miss it already
if you ever get the_chance
go_for_it
if_you_want the_extra burn
grab_a ginger beer to complement the_curry
the_mosque_kitchen is_a_very simple_and clean indian_place with_a menu_that won't put_a dent in_your wallet
the_chicken_curry is_outstanding and_some_of_the most tender curry_chicken i've ever_eaten
the_vegetable
chickpea
curry_was just_as delicious
a_huge plate_of curry over_rice for is_pretty amazing
they_have_an buffet portion after pm
but_i_found a_single portion to_be adequate
the_only letdown was the_lamb_curry
which wasn't nearly as tender
for what_it_is the_new mosque_kitchen
is_simply phenomenal
if_you_don't_like curry
don't_come_here
if_you_want fancy cutlery
don't_come_here
if want porcelain or china plates
don't_come_here
if_you_want table_service
don't_come_here
if you_need booze with your_food
don't_come_here
if_you_want_to eat_a really_tasty meal
which will leave you feeling full
but_not bloated
for hours after come_here
if_you_want_to eat well for pennies
come_here
if_you_want_to eat cheaply in_a family friendly canteen style eatery come_here
the address here_is right
but pictures are of the_old mosque_kitchen
went_with_the chicken_and beef curry with_rice
not_a_bad dish by_any standards
the_only_downside was we_had too_much leftover and_our fridge in_the rv was_not working
not_bad really
just meant back_to back meals of great_food
i_thought_that the_prices_were very_good and_the_food_was not_the_best
but better_than most
buffet_style
indian_restaurants
if_i_lived here
i_would_definitely come_back from time_to time
this_restaurant firmly deserves his reputation for good_food
immediately you notice many people_in traditional muslim dress
that's an_excellent sign
everything_is so clean here too
my_friend_and_i got the_buffet
this_was mainly do_not knowing what specifically to_order and wanting_to sample too_much
anyway
the_food_is_great
there_is so_much to_choose_from
i_especially liked the_pakora
rice
naan
and sheekh kebabs
those kebabs were bloody spicy
if you're doing the_buffet
you'll pay and_get your_plate at the_main counter
if you're purchasing items off their_menu
you_can pay where the_food_is being_served
they_only accept cash
i'd heard so_many good_things about the_mosque_kitchen but had_never been myself
i decided_to_go for_lunch_and just fell in_love_with the_concept
they_serve lunch from
am until_pm then offer an all_you_can_eat buffet until_pm
please note though that on fridays they are_closed before
pm for prayer
basically
there_is no waiting about here so_it_is the_perfect place_to_go during your lunch_hour at work if_you_want great_quality food fast
plus
the_prices aren't far off what_you_pay for_a sandwich so_it really_is a_winner
there_is no table_service so you_go up_to_the hot plate at the_back_of_the restaurant and_pick what you'd like to_eat
all_the meals are already prepared_and just waiting_for the taking
i_had sheekh kebabs with_rice
and my_companion had chicken_curry_and rice
we_could not_even make_a dent in our_plates as they_were heaped so high with food
we_thought it'd be rude not to_get_a nan_bread to accompany the_meal though as at they_are practically giving themaway
this_place doesn't serve alcohol because_it_is part_of_the mosque but_for all_the_time you're in_there you_really don't miss it
with the_quality_of_food so high and_prices so low it_really does tick all_the boxes
great choice_for a_cheap yet tasty meal
i_was originally going_to give the_mosque a_solid but_then i_had another think about_it and_i_decided i_was going_to_have to reduce this by star
and here_is why
pro followed by con
the_curry is really_tasty but_there_is more variation in just how tasty it_is
today for example i_was_a_bit dissapointed the_rice_was greasy and_the_chicken lacked flavour
it's cheap but_it's_not as cheap as_it used_to_be
the delight was_that you_could get more_food
and a_drink faster and cheaper than anywhere else
while it's still pretty much faster and_more
there_is less than you used_to get and you're paying almost more_than a_few_years ago
the_location_is good
it's central
on_that lovely bit_of edinburgh old_town that seems reserved for mentalists and drug users
however it's close_to pretty much all_of old_town and_the uni so_this is_fine
it's chilled out
the_guys are cool
they_do takeaway and_it's ironically an_amazing lunch_time hangover cure if you're suffering from_the night before
anyway i've mainly given it start because_it's not_as_good_as it used_to_be and_it's gotten more expensive
saying_that i_still eat_here a_couple_times a_week
favourite meal
meat curry
rice
dahl and veg
witha can of rubicon guava juice
sweet
there seems_to be two restaurants with_this name
but the_one i_went_to was_not_the one under the_mosque but_it's nearby
corner
since_i heard this_one has the_original chef
i_had
chicken pulao with_rice
there_was no chicken in_it
but_just this wonderful sauce over_rice
even in_a styrofoam bowl and eaten with_a plastic spoon
it_tasted really_great
not to_add that_it_was very_reasonably_priced at
lots_of rice drenched in sauce
the nd time_i_had it_with extra vegetable toppings
peas
carrots
and_potatoes for an_extra
it_wasn't as_good though
the chicken_curry_was even_better
very tender_chicken
great simple food_at fantastic prices
the_new mosque_kitchen provides a_simple yet basic setting for_those seeking an_authentic curry in_a_hurry
the_menu_is basic but has classic chicken
lamb_and vegetarian_options so likely to_be somehting to suit everyone and_with prices starting at
for tarka dahl with_rice to
for chicken_curry_and rice you definately wont be breaking the bank
the sag aloo was_delicious_and_the garlic_nan is worth_the_wait
if you've not_been here_before then i'll_try and set_the scene
dont think_of it_as_a restaurant
there's no menu cards or table_service
maybe more_of_a canteen
there's_a menu on_the_wall and_a self service area where_you are_served food that's ready and waiting
bear in_mind that the_restaurant belongs to the_mosque and_so there's no extravagance
it's plastic plates_and cutlery however it somehow makes_it feel more_authentic
as you_would_expect there's no alcohol available but_there_is a_good range_of soft_drinks including traditional lassies
all in_all if_you_like a_good curry_at fantastic prices then i'd_recommend you come_here
the_mosque_kitchen has_been on_my internal food radar since about day_of moving_to edinburgh
when asking_for recommendations on where to_go
almost everyone told_me i simply must_try the_mosque_kitchen
summed up
it's cheap
it's cheerful
it's no frills
but_it's_a big plate_of food
it's curry_and it's tasty
so_it_was finally over_a_year later
at pm in_the midst of_the fringe frenzy that_i stumbled upon it_with nothing in_my but guiness
whisky and_an appetite
and for_that the_middle_of a typical fringe day
surrounded by locals
visitors
performers
and pm feeling_like pm
i_dont know what time this_place would close during_the festival
but am is_a typical hit_the hay time
that_i lined up_in_the school cafeteria style queue and_ordered my_plate of_rice
lamb_curry
and paid up front
the_lamb_was_tender
the_sauce spicy_but that's about_as far_as it goes
it filled a_hole
it_was tasty
and_it would_make do for_just those occasions when_you're super hungry_and just need_to fill a_hole but want something different to_a sandwich hot dog kebab
they mosque_kitchen often do_the rounds at festivals too like christmas markets
with_their pop up shop
i_really_like their curry
they're not trying to_be_a haute cuisine restaurant
so for_a time_and a_place
the_mosque_kitchen is perfectly and_definitely an edinburgh institution in_its own right
ok
so here_is the_deal
there_are two mosque kitchens
a_couple_of months_ago i ate_at the_mosque_kitchen that is_on_the corner_of nicholson street and_i
was underwhelmed
to_say_the least
the_quality_of_the_food
meh
the cafeteria style setting
meh
no clean tables
meh
didn't_like it and_couldn't understand for_the love of_me why people_were getting all ravey about_it
right
so
get this
if you_walk through the_front gates of the_actual mosque
and_walk to_the back
there's another mosque_kitchen
where there_is table_service and_the_food_is positively moarish
it's so_good
i'm half suspecting them of_just drugging me when_i get in_there
i_get so_happy
i have_to_admit
i now come_here about once or twice a_week
usually with_a colleague
the plates_of food_you_get are_just absolutely ridiculous
and_the_prices_are amazingly good
it_never fails to keep_me full from
well into
which for_me is rather important as_i get right crabby when_i'm hungry
and_by crabby i_mean
hey lou
have you seen that memo i se
me
grrrrr
colleague
did you_just
growl at me
me
kssshhhgrrrrr
ok
so_that may not_have_been the_most eloquent explanation
but what_i'm trying_to get across here_is that mosque_kitchen saved my job
and_that
my_friends
is_a_good
good_thing
this kind of dining is_right up_my street
unfussy
uncluttered and unassuming
this_is how fast_food should be
i_will_be_back
the_mosque_kitchen is_by_far one_of_the best_places to_get_some of_the_most succulent kebabs in_edinburgh alongside a splash of dall and_a dollop of_spinach
all_over a_big full bowl_of rice
i_would_go here_at_least once or twice a_week when_i_was working at_the edinburgh uni library
and_would always_get a_little_bit_of_everything
i_was rarely if ever disappointed_by the_food_here
i_did make_the mistake of going_to the_new mosque_kitchen they_opened up_on nicholson
which wasn't_too impressive
but_was then glad to_find_out that the_original is_still alive and_well
be_warned that_this_is more_of_a cafeteria than a_restaurant
they_will serve you the_food inside
and_then you_go outside to the_plastic tables_and fold out chairs to_enjoy your warm meal
even so
you_would still find me here_at pm_on_a cold december night indulging in a_big bowl_of tasty mosque_kitchen food
anyone who gives this_place less than stars needs to_take_a long
hard look_at themselves
this placehas cheap curry
and_its like_a pot noodle
does exactly what_it says on_the tin
doesn't try_and be posh or_anything that_its not
just massive portions_of tasty cheap curry_for under_a fiver
dun no
loads_of people tell_me to_come_here
and_i_have come here_several_times
there_are not many_options
it_is canteen style food
yet the_portions_are huge
the_food_is cheap
and this_is_probably one_of_the best student meals you_will_get in_the_area for_the_price
especially in terms_of quantity
being vegetarian
i_have always gone for_the chickpea_curry
chana_masala
or the_lentil dal with_rice
the_naan looks decent for_the_price
plus it's massive
this_is a_good_place_to come when_you're really hungry_and just desperately want to_fill_up with_some food which_isn't too_bad for_you
it's got to_be better_than kebabs
right
so
this_is_definitely not_a place_for_a dinner date
nor for_a sophisticated ritual for ladies who like to_lunch
but it_will fill the hole
if_i wanted_a normal sized portion
i_would_go to himalaya cafe just up the_road and pay around the_same_price for_a delicious curry
yes
it's slightly smaller
but_the_food_is very_fresh
tasty
and_you_get salad with your_food
all_this in_a beautifully decorated cafe
which also offers yoga classes
himalaya also offer an_amazing chai latte
which entices me even_more
it's cheap_and very basic
but has a_good_variety_of curries at very low prices
and_the_portions_are massive so you're probably best asking_for take away_and finish_it off later
no airs and graces
no prevention
i've offend the_staff very_friendly on both occasions i've_been_here
it's mass produced food_but you_know_what
there's something refreshing about_this place's simplicity
while_visiting edinburgh
a_friend took_us to the_mosque_kitchen on our_last day in_town
as_a_vegetarian
i_thought they_had_a solid selection_for a_decent price
the food_was_tasty and_the_service_was on_point
first kitchen i_have_ever heard_of being_in or part_of a mosque
as its already been pointed out
reminds me of_a cafeteria
stand in_line
pick what_you_want
pay and go_back_to your seat
has surprisingly_good curry
i_really_enjoyed_the spinach lamb_curry
i_recommend it
they_also_have_a variety_of ethnic beverages to_have with_your_meal
what sold me_was_the amount_of_food for_the_price
it's cheap_and left_me stuffed
the_place also seemed clean when_i_was there and_the_staff also friendly
if_your tight on money and_have_a hankering for_curry and_want a_lot_of_food for cheap this_is_the_place
i ended_up_going into_this place_with some_friends
as they_said it_was_pretty_good and inexpensive
the actually dining_area isn't anything more then_a cafeteria type setting
but_there_are lots_of seats and they_can accommodate for larger parties
they_have a_lot_of_food places_like this_in the_states
where_you basically just_go through_a line and point to what_you_want
but_this_place actually serves decent_food
i_opted_for_the vegetarian curries_and rice plate
which_was pounds for a_big plate of_rice_and curries
i_was_really keen on the_aubergine
but_it must_be really popular because they_were_all out
so i_opted_for_the chickpea
mushroom and_potato curries
they_do_have meat
but none_of use tried any
i_loved_the chickpea_curry and_the mushrooms as_well
but_was not_a_big_fan_of the_potatoes
the chickpeas were way_better then_i expected and were_really well_spiced
overall
the_food_was quite_spicy
but if_you_can handle it
it_is_very enjoyable
the_only_thing
which_is_a personal thing
is_that_i like greens in_my food
or_at least for_it to_have something green in_it
the_options i_had didn't_have any peppers
etc
but_i_did try my boyfriends okra
which was_really_nice
so they_do offer some_good 'green' food_options
they provided a_good portion of_food_for the_price_and all up i_think_we paid pounds for_two meals
a_great_deal for_a cheap_and fast eat
i_wouldn't go_for_the ambience
but_they also_do offer take away if you'd like to_sit somewhere without florescent lighting or at_home
a_nice
quick meal_for a reasonable_price
i_don't live in_the_area
but out_of_the few_indian places_i've tried in_edinburgh
this_was_the_best one
i_have_been told a_few_times that_this_place is_an inexpensive gem and_for ten pounds i_thought why_not
the_decor_is pretty basic although that's to_be expected with_the low price offer
none_of_the dishes_were labelled
a_pretty basic shortcoming for_a_buffet style restaurant
indeed the_first one i've ever_been_to that you_have_to make educated guesses on_what you're actually eating
secondly the_way they_were kept
displayed and the_lack_of fresh replenishments was abysmal
i_haven't seen less desirable food_in quite some_time
after two plates of_what_i could safely assume was chicken_in different_and equally horrible guises i'd had_my fill although i_was_in no_way full
yes it's ten pounds and_it's budget buffet what's your problem i hear you say
i've_been_to tastier more bountiful buffets for_a_good four pounds less
i'd rather spend a_little_bit more cash and go_to mother india's cafe or go_to flip and_have plenty of change in_my pocket
this_place_is_great
super cheap_and a_ton_of_food
the_quality_is much better_than it_should_be for how_much you_pay
if_you_are_a hungry traveler who likes indian_food
this_is your place
the_menu_is limited
but the_amount_of_food and tastiness makes this a_star
note
this_is_not_the ritz
don't_expect a lavish meal
just plain
simple
quick
and_good
as a_long term patron of madison's indian_restaurants
taste_of_india
maharani
maharaja
and campus biryani
so_far
and_as_a former waitress at_an_indian_restaurant
i'm confident in saying_that flavor of_india has_some of_the_best north_indian food in_the_city
its menu_is comparable in price_and selection to most other_indian_restaurants_in madison
however
it_has a_few_things that set it head and shoulders above other locations
decor
service
and_a dinner_buffet
the_walls are painted in rich hues
a_welcome pick me up_on blustery gray days filled_with stinging rain and wind
even the_ceiling is decorated in beautiful tapestries
preventing any grating effects of overhead lighting
while still allowing for the_space to_be bright_and cheerful
the_service_was_excellent
prompt
helpful
attentive
and_friendly
they_even gave my_party complimentary papadam with tamarind_sauce and_mint and tomato chutneys
the_dinner buffet_is_a rare find_in indian_restaurants
and_at
it's_quite reasonably_priced
it_also features a_number_of dishes not listed on_the regular_menu
and many are_vegetarian
there's_also a_selection_of several desserts
for_dinner last_night
my_companion and i_chose to_order samosas
flaky crust and well_seasoned contents perfectly accented by the_mint_chutney
onion_and black pepper kulcha
stuffed_with sauteed onions
warm_and fluffy
and_a shared entree of chicken_tikka_masala
rich
thick medium_spicy sauce in_a vibrant orange shade
with perfectly_cooked moist chunks_of_chicken
unlike the sometimes rubbery overdone chicken i've experienced elsewhere
with complimentary rice
par for_the course in_madison
for drinks
my_companion had a_mango_lassi
sweet_and creamy
with beautiful presentation heretofore only seen at taste_of_india
and_i enjoyed a taj_mahal
ounce indian_beer
i_had_to stop my_companion from licking the_chicken_tikka_masala serving bowl
this was_more_than_enough food for_two_people
and we_could hardly move after_dinner
entrees_are easily shared between two people
spice_levels are adjusted for midwestern taste_buds
so be_sure_to stress a_high spiciness level if that's your intent
i_had_an excellent experience_at flavor of_india last_night
the_service_was fast_and polite
the_samosas tasted homemade
the_prices_were exceedingly reasonable
and_the_food very_tasty
i had_the_chicken_tikka_masala some of_the_best_i've_had ever
my_dining companion had_the_chicken shahikorma
he_was swayed by_the cashews in cream_sauce
his dish was_delicious
but we_both agreed that mine was_better
the_nan_was perfect
we_were so stuffed from_the shared samosas
our_entrees
and nan that we_had_to forgo dessert
i_look_forward_to returning_to flavor of_india very_soon
i'm well acquainted with every_indian restaurant_in_madison
and this_is_the_best hands down
i_sampled the_vegetarian sampler appetizer
two vegetarian_entrees
naan and_mango_lassi
and_everything_was excellently prepared
the_fried vegetarian appetizer wasn't_too greasy_and had incredible flavor
the_mango_lassi the_way it's supposed_to be
thick_and rich
and_both the_entrees_were perfect
flavor_of india_is a_perfect compliment to_the capitol square
however a_bit hidden
i_highly_recommend it
my_mom
aunt and_i go_here pretty much every_time_we head to madison
we try_to vary our_orders to_make our_way through the_menu
but the_chicken_tikka_masala never fails to_be amazing
a_few_weeks_ago we_did a_take away order and_sat at_the concert on_the square with_our dinners
i_can't_wait until next summer to_do it_again
i_also am dying to_get up_there during_the day to_try_their lunch_buffet
the_only_thing_i don't understand is_that every_time we're there we're usually one_of only_a_few people_in the_dining_room
madison eaters
go_here
wonderful lunch spot
the_buffet_was about vegetarian
with_some unusual offerings like mushrooms and turnips
along_with channa_masala
vegetable_pakoras
some potato balls
and vegetable_biryani
all the_entrees_were tasty_and hot
but_i wish there_was a_little_more fruit and salad
because one plate_of the_delicious but oily foods did me_in
and_i almost always go_back_for seconds
the_chutneys tamarind
mint
and_onion were mostly unremarkable
the_onion was_a_little strong
but_this_was better_than any indian_food_i've_had_in quite awhile
and_i appreciated the abundance of_vegetarian_dishes
this_place_is fantastic
i_was_a_little skeptical at_first
i_am one who tends_to veer away from buffets
but oh so_delicious
came_in_for a_saturday lunch and_the_place seemed_to be full_of regulars
our_waiter sat us
asked_if_we wanted anything other_than water
and pointed to the_back_of_the restaurant
where a_buffet is set_up against the_back wall
there_was salad
dessert
chutney
raita
naan
samosas
veggie pakoras
and about kinds_of curry
i'm_not entirely sure_what i_tried
i_know i got_some goat_curry
channa_masala
chicken_tikka
mutter_paneer
a_little_of everything really
everything was_so_delicious
probably some_of_the tastiest indian_food_i've_ever_had
i_am craving_it right_now
buys you a_lunch_buffet
off_with student id
also
save room_for the_mango_ice_cream
mmmmm perfect ending
all_of_the other_reviews are correct the_food_here_is awesome
minus one_star
though
for the_decor
it_was much prettier when_it_was the_bar
ah
well
i_am_from seattle
and happened_to be in_madison for the_weekend
i_am a_big_fan_of indian_food_and was wondering if madison had_any good places to_go
i_used yelp to find_this_place
and_decided
what_the heck
i'll_try it_out
the_food_here rivaled the_better places_i've_been in seattle
it's_not the_best_place i've_been_to
but_it_was definitely good
and i_would_go_back
i_had_the_chicken tandoori saag
hot
they_didn't skimp on the_heat
which_i appreciated
and_the_chicken_was cooked_well
i_would_have_liked the_saag to_have a_little_more spinach
but it_was_good nonetheless
i_also_had garlic_naan
which i'm moderately obsessed with
it_was_good
overall_a good_meal
i_can't comment on whether or_not it_was pricey
it_was_about the_same_price as indian_food_in seattle
but i'm_not sure_if food_is normally cheaper in_madison or_not
coming_from california
and formally managing an_indian_restaurant there
i_have high expectations when_it_comes_to indian_food_and flavor of_india lived up_to it
i_went_to there buffet_and my_only complaint_was that_it_was far too mild
don't_get_me_wrong the_food_was_very flavorfull but i'd_like_to see more heat
i_wish_i_had enough time in_madison to_go there_for_dinner there menu_is vast and_i hear from my_friends its spicier too
the_only weird thing_is they_have beef curries
san_francisco doesn't_have that
i avoided this_place_for like two_years because_of_the giant
student id discount
sign in the_window
which_i generally consider a_bad sign more fool i
when my_partner and i_finally tried them
we_were blown_away
they_will make things super_spicy if_you_ask them_to
as my_partner prefers
but they_also make things appropriately mild if requested
i'm wimpy
their saag is_delicious
one_of_my_favorites
as is_their chicken_tandoori kebab
although i_have_to be_careful with the_latter because i_think there's something in_the marinade that disagrees with_me it's_hard_to say for_sure because every_time_i eat_it
i_make a_complete pig of myself
anyway
the_naan_is also_good
various varieties we_like the_spinach stuffed
and my_partner loves their biryani
they deliver via straight yourdoor
but_if_you don't_want_to pay the fee
they also_do take_out
since they're right on_the square
you don't_even really_need to live nearby as long_as you_have transportation of some_kind
including_a direct bus route
and_the student discount is_good at dinnertime as_well as lunch
at_lunch
they_have_a buffet
we've never gone
but_it's under a_person
i_just hope_they get a_lot_of delivery and lunchtime business
because_it seems_like whenever we_go in_at dinnertime
the_place_is more_than half empty
it'd be_good for a_group you wouldn't_have to worry_about seating
they definitely serve beer_and_wine
not_sure about hard liquor
decent_indian_food lacking real flavor
lacking heat
otherwise it_was_still good
went_here_for a_sunday lunch with_friends and_overall was_happy with_what they_had to_offer
i_always try_everything on_a buffet
unless i_know for_sure i_won't like_it
hehe
so i_can_say_that the_buffet_is kinda small_but does have_good dishes
they're chicken_tikka_masala_was so so_yummy
and_of_course my_favorite sweet dough balls
gulab_jamun was_also_good
my_friends enjoyed the_tandoori_chicken
and_vegetables in_a yellow curry_sauce
we_also very_much liked the_naan
even_more so_when they_brought_out the_cheese_naan
the one_thing all_of_us detested was_the papadam
it_was made_from lentils_and although_we all had_a different taste reaction it it
i_thought_it_was spicy_and bad
my_friend just thought_it_was gross
another was intrigued but_didn't much like_it either and_could taste that_it_was made_of lentils
we_all hated it
overall
for_a_quick basic indian_lunch
go_for_it
per_person
i approve
quick visit_to madison and we_needed something_to warm our bones
found flavor of_india here_at yelp_and figure some spice would do_the trick
the_place had the_typical ethnic food vibe going_on
quiet with white tablecloths and low lighting
nothing_to_write_home about
but_since it_was_pretty empty it_was_just fine
the_food_was_good
i_had_the shrimp_vindaloo and my_girlfriend had the_chicken_curry
my out_of spice wasn't_very spicy_for my_tastes
but we_all know_that depends on_the kitchen's hand that_night
overall
i'd give the_food stars
but_the_service is_what won the over_to stars
i didn't_get his name
but_the male waiter we_had_was excellent
at_the_end_of_the night
we asked_about local dessert places and_he not_only recommended several but used his phone to_look up the_exact addresses
he_also told_us not to_go_to cold stone b c it_wasn't local
which always wins points for_someone in_my_book
totally went above and beyond and_it_was much appreciated from_this out_of_town tourist
surprisingly_good
directly across_the_street from_the capitol building in_a nondescript storefront
but the_interior_is attractive and serene
food_was_tasty
large_portions
reasonable_prices
service was_quite_good although_i see from the_reviews that it_has_been erratic for others
my only_complaint would_be that_when i_asked_for
hot
i_got_the american hot
not_indian
hot
this_place_is incredible
you_know that_a college city with out_of every students being_indian asian is going_to_have a_pleasant supply of_delicious and affordable indian_food
went_in for_the_buffet on_a monday afternoon and_was blown_away
plenty_of_vegetarian options including saag_paneer
vegetable_korma
mushroom and pea masala
potato samosa
potato pakora
onion pakora
naan
mango_ice_cream
rice_pudding
perfect gulab_jamun
carrot halwaa
delicious zucchini and_potato dish
and_at least chicken beef curries as_well
everything_was perfectly flavored and presented
absolutely_delicious north indian_cuisine
flawlessly executed
very hospitable staff
two decent bathrooms
brand new cushions
nice lighting
just a_really_good dining atmosphere
lunch_buffet_is
that_is_a steal for_someone coming_from the_west coast where they_charge for_a measly entree buffet
this_is deluxe and delish
we_went_to flavor of_india after_a rally in_madison
i do_not_have indian_food often
so_was apprehensive about the_flavors and_spices
the_restaurant had few customers for a_saturday evening
especially since all_the_other restaurants_around the capitol were packed_with protesters
the_only_downside of our_visit was_the initial amount of_time it_took to_get service
they_seemed short staffed
however
the_staff members that_were there were_very_friendly and_prompt
we_had_to flag the_server down_to place our_order
the_food_was_delicious
when_we_left
i noted that_i_would come_back_to madison just for_dinner
i_had_the vegetable masala
my_companion had_the_lamb masala
we greatly enjoyed these_dishes and would_highly_recommend
we_also_had_a fried_cheese appetizer
and_we_were not_as thrilled with_that
the_potato nan_was great_as_well
excellent_food
very_impressed
i_ordered_the matter_paneer and_naan from straight yourdoor
com
excellent
speedy
pricey service
the matter_paneer had average flavor_and spice
but_it_was lacking_in substance
i_had_a hard time locating the_cheese pieces
and_i_think that_is rather unacceptable for such_a high margin dish
for peas
curry and_cheese
the_naan_was tender
but_a_little flavorless and_dry
final assessment
average to good
and i_won't_be rushing to_order take_out from flavor of_india anytime soon
i_think_they could_do better
the diverse cuisine from the_indian subcontinent varies heavily by religion and ethnicity
this_place_is owned and run_by indian muslims
so the_food_is halal
preparation of_the_food
but especially meat
is supervised by imams
usually this means a step cleaner
more humane
than_just u
s
government inspected
but this_isn't always true
and they_serve beef curries
you won't find_this in hindu establishments
just_like you won't find any pork in_here
the minimum critical mass of south_asian customers is in_the_area thanks_to the elite graduate programs of uw madison to ensure that any_indian_restaurant in_this town has_to_be at least pretty_good
and this_one_is a step up_from that
we_first dropped in after_a_long
cold day_of protesting for worker rights
and inexplicably
every_other restaurant_and bar surrounding the capitol was packed_with cold weary protesters
this_one_was empty
normally a warning sign
but we_needed to_sit down
a very_helpful madison police officer
who all seem ridiculously over educated
recommended the_place
but i_was_a_bit leery since he_was slim and_in good shape
i_usually get_my better restaurant recommendations from fat cops
what a_pleasant surprise
it_was dhinchak
wonderful
the_service_was traditionally unhurried
the_waiter was_friendly_and polite
and unlike a_lot_of south_asian muslim restaurants
quite_nice to_my consort
my disobedient and independent gori wife
and chief of staff
the papadum was_hot
fresh
and crisp
served_with what seemed_to be fresh made chutneys
we_enjoyed_the shrimp_curry
chana dal
chickpeas
and palak_paneer
a distant cousin of american creamed spinach
make_sure_you order an_indian bread with_your_meal
chapati
paratha
nan
they_have_a good_selection
a_nice basmati_rice came with_the_meal
as_it_should
they_have_a wide_selection_of vegetarian_dishes
almost a requirement in_madison
the_decor_is pleasant
though uninspired
nicer than the_usual casual indian joints
but_not as elegant as more expensive formal indian_restaurants
instead_of indian_music
they piped in_some annoying muzak like smooth
jazz
though at_a forgivable background volume
surprising for_a muslim establishment
they_have a_good_selection_of wine_and beer
some local
some_indian
there really aren't many_places in wisconsin to_have wine from_india
still
i_recommend_the indian_beer instead
i_highly_recommend_this restaurant for_you firangi types who want_to try_indian_food
but are leery of_the reputed heat of south_indian
tamil
cuisine
the_food_here_is pretty mild
try to_eat the_food like we_do
with_your right hand
it_tastes better that_way
if_you're_a desi bhai who likes your_food spicy
know_that i_wasn't successful in getting them to_make my_food nice_and hot
but in_general i've_found that northern_indian muslim cooking isn't relatively spicy
the_food_here_is quite flavorful
it's_not bland
it's_just_not hot enough
i_did get the_waiter_to bring me_a
hot_sauce
a_red chillies paste which did_have a_little bite to_it
finish your_meal with_a sweet indian desert
like galub jamun and masala tea
chai
and don't_expect the_waiter_to come running up_with_the bill
they employ indo pakistani manners and expect you_to relax after_eating
they're pretty attentive though
so they_will bring_you your check when_you signal for_it
try to_avoid if buffet hours are almost over
waiter_was annoyed we_came_in minutes_before lunch close
felt so unwelcome that i'll_try not to_go_back
food_was_ok
but_nothing any more memorable than other_indian_buffets in_the_city there's several good ones
very_good_indian_food for very reasonable_prices
especially_when you consider that_it_is right_on capitol square
you_can even_get a_discount with a_student id
i_got_the vegetable_korma
which_was fantastic
sadly
there_was no lamb_korma
but_that_is okay
flatbread was_good
especially the_potato stuffed one
we_got complimentary soup
which_was_nice
service was_very_attentive
not a_ton to_say
otherwise
the_food_was_good
it_was_very quiet and_we_had_a nice double date
the_server was_friendly_and wasn't afraid_to take an_extra minute to_talk_to us
it is_a_nice relaxing place for_an evening meal
authentic_indian_food
very_flavorful
reasonable portions
very fair price value by nyc standards
slightly above prices of_other student venues nearby
i've_only gone for_the_lunch_buffet which_is wonderful
i_love their_naan so_much spinach
plain
i_don't_care
service_at lunch_is great_with plates being removed within seconds of going_for round two all for_under person
i've never written a_bad review on_yelp because usually i_don't_think it's_worth_it but i_have_to stand up_and say_that my_partner and_i_had_a horrible experience_here
i_was over a_year_ago
maybe even two now
but we_went_in for an_early dinner_there
we_had eaten there two_other times_and had pretty_good experiences there
he's a celiac so it's_nice to_find places where he can_eat almost_everything
we_were_eating our_meal
the_waiter was_nice_and we_were_the_only ones there
when all_of a sudden
there_was mold in_the_food
he_had one_of_the curries_and when he_took a_bit he_made a_terrible face and spit it_out
sure enough
there_was_a speck of mold in_his food
basically
they reheated the_thing over_and over again and_he_was left_with
a dusty
taste in_his mouth
absolutely gross
i_haven't even gone to_an_indian food_joint since because_of this
i'm_very positive about places_and worked in_a_restaurant for_years but_when_i saw this_on top restaurants_in_madison on_yelp
i_had_to speak out
some_of_the_best_indian buffet food_i've_had
great_variety
full flavor
depth and freshness
naan_and_rice were_not dried out
the_gulab_jamun was_still soft_and milky
not dried out and_hard
the_sauces_were very rich_and more flavorful
not watered_down than_what_i would_get at_any minneapolis indian_buffet
great_vegetarian selection
the_only_thing i_would_like_to see is if_they made_fresh pickles
the_ones they_had out were_pretty oil soaked
probably_not crunchy
i_wish this_place_was closer
four_stars for_food
two_stars for service
it_was fairly empty when i_went_there and_it_took the_waiter forever_to come get my_order
i had_plenty_of time to_look_at the_menu_and ordered my_food and_drink at the_same_time
the_food_came_out fairly quickly
i_got_the chana marsala
it_was well_made
pretty_spicy and interestingly had veggies in_it
a_nice_touch
the_naan_was overdone
it_was fairly crispy_and had obviously spent too_much time_in the_oven
the_service_was horrible
didnt see my waiter after he delivered my_food
had_to hunt down a_different server for_a refill on_my pepsi and_i_had to_find somebody else to_bring my check_and take_my money
i_would_probably go_back again
in hopes that i_get better service
however the_food_is highly_recommended
i've tried_the_lunch_buffet at two indian restaurants_in_madison
and i_prefer flavor of_india
i_don't claim to_know indian_food well
but the_flavors here just seemed_a_little better
although maharani has more choices
this was_my_first indian_experience in_madison
and honestly
i_wasn't expecting much
however
we_were pleasantly_surprised by their_lunch_buffet
which_was_a steal at
their_food wasn't_the freshest
but_that's to_be expected from most buffet places
their selection_of food_was_decent
from samosas to chicken_masala
from garlic_naan to potato vindaloo
from saag_paneer to rice_pudding
the_waitress also made_sure we never_went thirsty
immediately filling up our cups the_moment someone took a_drink
it_was_actually kinda disconcerting
but meh
the turdoori chicken is_good
the place_is_clean_and the_staff_was_friendly
the_rice wasnt to my_liking but it_wasn't_bad
also my_bf got the_lunch_buffet deal which_we ot to_go_and it_wasn't_bad
for
he_got rice
lamb
chicken
some dessert thing and bread
oh_and rice
and_a soup
see
not_a_bad deal
lol
we_got it to_go
the_place_is sort of old school looking with_the black and white title and pinkish decor but
like_i said very very_clean
oh_and the_meal i_got was_also about dollars
wasn't_the cheapest but_i_had the_meal at
i'm_still full
it's not_the_best_indian_food
but for_the_price it's_good
and the_service_is_friendly
family_owned
the_decor doesn't feel quite like an_indian_restaurant
but more_like_a diner
it's a_fun mismatch
even weirder
there_is_also filipino food on_the_menu
strange combination
but i_like_it
i've_only ever had_the_buffet
some_of_the items_are hit_or_miss
but_the tandoori_chicken_is yummy and the_aloo_gobi is_also_very enjoyable
the_owners don't always_have the_same_thing on_the_buffet
so it's_always a_nice surprise to see_what they're serving for the_day
the_paneer naan is_delicious_and i_could happily eat only that for_the_rest_of my_life
we_go_to vegas or times a_year
we_found_this_place by looking for_indian_food online
we finally_got to_eat_there on
we_really liked_the_food
it_was fresh_and_tasty
the_thali is especially good
the gf had_this
i_had_the chilli_chicken
never_had that indian_dish before
it_was_very
very_good
had_a_lot_of chicken in_it
we_will try_the_lunch_buffet on_our next_trip up_to vegas
in apr may
we met the_owner when_she took_our_order
very_friendly
i_love to_see owners actually work their business
shows they care
location_is easy_to find decatur just south of_the i
in_the target plaza
plenty of parking
the_other yelp'ers really nailed it
no ambiance with_the diner booths
but the_food_is_good
and_it's family_owned
so you_can't beat that
and_the_prices_are great
we grabbed a_restaurant
com gc for
and i_ended_up paying under including tax and tip for chicken_dishes
a shrimp_dish
and two_orders_of nan
my_favorite_was_the chicken_tikka_masala
very_flavorful
wish this_place_was closer to_my_house and_or was open later
but_i'll be_back
boo
this_place_is out_of business
i_visited hurry curry on_a_saturday evening for_a take away dinner
i_believe i_visited on_their second or third day_of operation
i entered a_restaurant with modern decor that_was spotlessly clean
having read about_the restaurant_in_the republic prior_to arriving
i immediately headed towards one_of_the two flat screen televisions to_place my_order
ordering was easy and_quick and_the menus offered descriptions of the_indian_food for_those who may be unfamiliar with the_cuisine
i_ordered butter_chicken
naan_bread and_basmati_rice
this came_to
it_was_a pleasure to_see
as_is done in many_other countries
that_the tax was included_in the_price_of each_item
while i_could_have swiped my credit_card to_pay at_the
menu monitor
i_chose to_pay cash and received service_from the_friendly lady at the_cash_register
she_also validated my parking in_the az center garage
my butter_chicken
you_can choose naan or rice as_a side
was
and_my naan_was another dollar
which brought the_total cost of my_meal to
because_i_was ordering take away
i_did_not order a_drink
i_did
however
see_that the_restaurant_is applying for_a liquor license
presumably for_the sale of beer given that_there_is no
bar
in_the quick_service space
after a_wait of maybe five minutes
i_received my_food in what one might describe as
higher quality
chinese_food boxes
the_naan_bread_was wrapped in foil
after a_short drive home
i transferred my_food from box to plate_and began_to enjoy my_dinner
while the_rice_was very well_cooked
generally fluffy_and not clumped together
the_naan
as_the republic also reported
was_somewhat disappointing
while it_was_definitely naan_and not pita_bread
i_found my serving to_be almost cracker like in texture_and too cool of_a temperature
i assume this may be because the_naan_was prepared earlier in_the day
i_wonder
though
if_they could_have devised a way_to warm the_bread before serving in_a convection oven
my butter_chicken_was flavorful
but_also rather cool in temperature
portion_sizes were_more_than adequate
when_i visited
the_restaurant_was empty
because_i hope this_restaurant will survive
i_think_the concept is novel
i sent some_of_the concerns detailed above in_the form_of constructive criticism to_the_restaurant after_eating my_dinner
would i return
sure
i_enjoyed a_healthy
filling and_flavorful dinner_for a_fair price
and
when_i return
i_will_be happy_to adjust my star_rating upwards if some minor improvements have_been made
ok so here_is the skinny on a_place i_have_been anticipating for quite some_time
hurry curry_is small
basic
and completely neat o
ordering is done via touchscreen televisions and and paid_for by swiping your credit_card
if_you_want_to pay cash
you_can do_so at_the_counter
you'll slow things down for_sure
think_of the visa commercials
they_are pending a liquor license right_now
the_people working_there were_nice
and_offered to_help me with_the ordering process
sorry
if_you_can't figure this out
you need_to_go off yourself immediately and stay out_of_the gene pool
the_food_is premade
and_in pots in_the_middle_of_the kitchen
when_you_order
they go get a_plate
put some_rice and_some main_dish on_it and bring_it to_you
the_food_i got was_tasty
albeit a_bit underspiced
they_are planning on staying open until_pm nightly
i thanked them for_their ambitious plans and_let them know i_hope_they don't give up like a_lot_of places do
if_you_live in_the_city
and like_this_place
i ask you to_do the_same
it_would suck if_i got used_to this for_dinner_and they changed to_say
pm closing
too
too cool
i_ordered on a_touch screen
my_first_time doing so
the buttered chicken was_awesome
i_don't_know much about_indian cusine but_this restuarant gave_me_a nice introduction
i_will_be_back
alot
if_you_are looking_for_a fresh change of pace then hurry curry_is the_place_for you
i_didn't_know much about_indian_food
probably still don't know much_more today
but i_can_say_that i_have_eaten here_several_times and never_have been_disappointed
new slick modern place
friendly_staff
quick_service all help make the_place worthy of_the visit
the_food_is_outstanding
one_of_the things_i like best is_that the_menu_is changing all_the_time
there_are new manager specials every_time_i visit
now when_i order i_just go_for_the special
it hits_the spot every_time
i_hope everyone gets a_chance_to discover this_place
downtown needs new creative places_like this and_this_place makes downtown phx just a_bit_more interesting_and lively
i_cant wait_for my_next meal
not_a_bad place
its fast
convenient
and_the_food_is not_too shabby
they_have_a daily selection_of entrees you_can choose from that_are premade in pots
you_choose these items from_a computer
and you_pay at_the computer
very high tech
i_had_the butter ck which_was surprisingly edible and_tasty
the_naan_was made on_the spot with dough that_they roll out_and bake in_their special oven
nice
i_also_tried the_mango_lassi which_was_good
but_i_did not_like the_spice they sprinkle on top
for_the setup
location
price_and food
i_will_be_back
every_dish is different
i_have_tried most_of_the stuff on_the_menu
all_of_the dishes_are flavorful
i_prefer either a chicken_dish like the_butter_chicken or spicy curry_chicken or tikka_masala
i_also_like the dishes_that use cheese
every_time_i make_sure_to get the_garlic_naan no matter_what entree i_get
the_price_is very_reasonable
the_people are_friendly
i_have_been there plenty of_times and_i_think it_is_the_best food_joint in_az center
hurry for_curry
then wait
it_took minutes_for me to_get_my order
don't get_it confused with_the chain curry in_a_hurry
that_would imply they_are quick
also don't get_it confused with naan_and curry_in san_francisco
because then it_would_be cheaper
faster and_better
this_is the_second_time i've_eaten here
the_first_time_i had the_chicken_curry
which took awhile too
also
i_was confused
because_i thought indian_curry is_usually thick like_a paste
this curry was_extremely watery
also
i_was confused because_they gave_me_a tiny little piece_of undercooked bread
which i_guess was_supposed_to_be the_naan
the_second_time was when_i had_to_wait
longer i_mean
when_i finally_got my_order
my extra order_of_naan wasn't ready
although they certainly had_enough naan for_everyone else
i sat down
finished my_food
and sure enough no extra naan
the_naan i_had_was still undercooked
so_i thought they_would just under cook the_extra too
since they_don't bother to_finish cooking it fully
furthermore
what's with_the ordering through computers
are they meant to_save time
or look cool
the_line is_always backed up_with people navigating thru menus on these
also
with_the automated ordering machines
they should_have extra man power in_the_kitchen right
nope
seriously
this_is indian_food gone wrong
next_time you_have_a curry craving go_for any_of_the great_indian restaurants_in_the_valley
i've liked all the_ones i've tried
or_if you're downtown
go next_door_to the mexican restaurant
the pizza place
or
never thought i'd say_this
subway
if_you_have the_time hop over_to breadfruit or pastabar
or_just wait till people tire of_this_place and_after it closes
eat_at_the new_restaurant that takes its place
besides for my_food not_being especially hot
the_food_was_great
quick_service
good_food
and great_prices
if_i_lived there i_would_be returning often
i_was jonesing for chicken_tikka_masala
after resisting the temptation to_be_the loser eating_at an_indian_buffet alone i_decided_to_try this_new place i'd been hearing about
after fighting downtown traffic and parking
i walk up_to_the touch screen and discover no tikka_masala
super lame
apparently the_menu changes daily
i begrudgingly order the_butter_chicken_and some_naan
i_was_pleasantly_surprised
i_was_expecting a generic pei wei experience but aside from the_naan being a_little rubbery and oily it_was_actually quite_tasty
i_really wish this_place wasn't in_the black hole that_is_the arizona center
er
copper square
whatever
by_the looks of_how dead it_is at lunchtime i_don't_know how_good the survival rate is but_i'm excited to_go_back_and_try some_of_the_other items
was so_excited to_have an_indian_restaurant_in downtown phoenix that i_can go_to for_lunch
was instantly disappointed_that they_offer_a limited selection_of menu_items
their_menu changes daily and_they_offer a_handful_of items each day
plus
they_only use dark chicken meat
hello
white is so_much healthier for_you
the_food_wasn't very_flavorful
portions_were decent_but would_have much rather had_a buffet
ate_there today as a_family after_the movies
the_menu changes daily and_you use a_touch screen to_order no problem
however
after i_ordered
i stood in_front_of_the counter to_get cups for_water for more_than min and was_completely ignored by_the two staff members
finally when another customer was paying cash for_his ordered something_that still requires human interaction i_was_able_to catch their attention and get_my cups
so customer_service non existent
the_food_was_pretty_good
we_had butter_chicken
vindaloo chicken_and dal with_two extra naan's on_the side
the_best entree was butter_chicken
the_vindaloo_was tasty but_not nearly as_spicy as_it_should have_been
the_naan_was freshly made on_the spot
overall though
i'd rather have_gone to one_of_the many indian_buffets for_lunch same_price
better_food and value
of_course
don't think there_are any in_the_area
so you'd have to_make_a trip
got takeout here the_other_night
disappointed there's no tikka or vindaloo on_the_menu but meh
it rotates so_maybe i'll get lucky next_time
the_service_was courteous_and fast
price_was right
portions_were adequate
naan turned_out ok
as did the_veg biryani_and kidney masala
i_got butter_chicken_and the kidney masala to_go tonight
and dipped my tongue in tastes ok
i'd say more
but_i'm in_a_hurry
bitches
next morning edit
bummer
they burned the bean curry this_time
butter_chicken_was fine
looks like the_neighborhood still desperately needs decent_indian takeout
indian_food
new fangled technology
cute name
central location
convenient to light rail
there's plenty to_like
theoretically
but our_experience here_was one_and done
we_arrived early evening
before a ballgame
it_seemed a_little_off peak
like maybe_the b team was_on duty
we_ordered via the touch screen
and_after a_couple tries
generated a receipt
then waited a_long while for
fast_food
and it_seemed longer because_you dont get_a human confirmation that_it's even_in progress
half the_wait
i wondered if_there_was a_problem moreso because workers behind the_counter looked as disoriented and idle as_we_were
eventually
they_brought the_food
or we retrieved it
i forget
but none_of this inspired much confidence or good will
my_curry was_on_the bland side
not terrible
but this_place_is altogether too tentative
dinner before a show at_the herberger
we_ate at hurry curry_at the arizona center
a_small_place where_you order pay at_a computer then pick up your_food at_the_counter
it_seems everything_was prepared in_advance
as_all of_our orders_were filled very quickly
all four_of us_ordered something different_and we_shared
my_favorite_was_the butter_chicken
also the_naan_was_good
served piping_hot
pretty good_indian_food_in phoenix
i'm waffling between and stars
will_i eat_at hurry curry again
yes
why
it_was fast
it_was_not a sandwich
it_is close_to work
ok
i'm_going with stars_because i_will most likely go_there over the_other
in_a_hurry
options at_the arizona center
my co_worker picked up our_food
she said the touch screen ordering was_great
and we_both got the_butter_chicken
it_was_ok nothing out_of_this_world amazing
but it_was_very saucy
which_i like
next_time
i'll probably get something with_some spice
i_didn't realize it_was_not going_to_be spicy_at_all
imagine the pickiest eater in the_world
then times it by_a million
that's my boss and_most times i'm afraid_to even suggest a place_to_eat to_him
he_took me_to this underrated downtown gem and_i_was instantly hooked
first of_all
if_you_don't know indian_food that's ok
simply ask one_of_the servers for_a sample
they_will let_you sample everything but_the made_to_order black pepper shrimp
my favorites_are the_chicken_vindaloo and_butter_chicken
you_must order some rice_and_garlic na'an to_have_the full taste experience
this_is why you_see some yelpers complain about_the sauciness and_or lack_of fulfillment with_their meals
the spicy_chicken briyan
sp
is quite_good
but has that_all spice taste to_it that always rubs me the_wrong way
my cousins are half pakistani and i_have_had excellent_indian_food
this_place_is not far behind
so give it_a_shot
and_again
don't_be shy to_ask_for a sample
i_was initially excited at the_idea_of fast indian_food
the ordering eperance at_the kiosk is novel
on my_first and_only trip_to hurry curry i_was_a_bit disappointed
the_menu lacked the_number_of options one_would see at_other_indian reatraunts
i_ordered_a dish_that equated to_a black stew of lentils and_spices with_naan
despite_the limited menu_and ordering format it_too the_food several minutes to_be ready
for_the_price
no drink
the_portion_was very_small as_was_the piece on naan
the_flavors_were quite muted when compared_to some indian_places
and_this also disappointed me_as i_like bold and_spicy indian_foods
i_gave their condiment a_try
it_looked_like onions_and peppers in_a sauce
however it_was_just very_very salty_and lack any_other flavor
i_then went to_get_my parking validated
i_then found_out when leaving the garage that_the validation that_this_place offered was virtually useless
this ended up adding another to_a quick_and small indian_lunch
i_was intrigued by_the computer kisok ordering
however not getting_the human interaction acknowledgement that your_order was received on was uncomfortable for_me
i_ordered thier butter_chicken_and was_given the choice_of either rice_or naan
why can't i_have both for_the
i_can add to_get both for_at least extra
and a_mango_lassi
i selected my_order to_go_and awkwardly waited
wondering if they_got my_order
if_i was_supposed_to wait at_the_counter for_my mango_lassi or_if it_all came out at once
it_wasn't busy
like customers waiting on to_go orders
but the_employees appeared just_as awkward trying_to put the_food together
the man before me had_ordered one_of_their specials that_day the_butter_chicken wrap
the_butter_chicken_was way_to saucy for_a wrap and_the workers were clearly flustered by the_fact_that it_was busting thru the_naan
the_employees there wanted to_make_it over for_him but_he said_he would_take it as_is
they_make their_naan one at_a time
which_means you get_it fresh but adds to the_wait
like many_of the_other_reviewers i waffled between and stars
while the_food_was_good
not_great
the awkwardness of_the expereince has me dropping it to_a
will i_go_back
yeah
until i_get a_good_indian_restaurant downtown
i wavered between and stars on_this_one
but i_decided_to be nice_and round up
i_work in_the arizona center
i walk by hurry curry probably or times a_day
but do_not venture in
why
i_really don't_have_a taste for_indian_food
but came_here_with scott w at his request
experience was_okay
company was definately more exciting then the_restaurant_itself
for_starters
menu_was limited and pricey
i_went_with the_butter_chicken on naan
ordered at_the kiosk
and paid with_my card
poor scott went serveral minutes_before he was_able_to pay with cash
drink area_is self serve
we_ended_up eating outside
tables_were wobbly
and_you had_to_be careful
i've lost plates of_food_and hot drinks in_my day from wobbly tables
i_get nervous
my_food was_warm
not hot
but warm
i_was dissapointed that it_wasn't cooked hot
anyways
i_will_be_back
but_only if someone else wants me to_go_with them
this_place gets a weak
thursday evening i attended
title of show
at_the herberger
oye
and_decided i_wanted_to eat before_the show
i found_out amy b was_going and i_asked_if she wanted to_meet me somewhere close
arizona center doesn't offer much in_the way_of cheap_and quick_and i_wanted more_than_a sandwich
i suggested this_place_and she said ok as_she had_not yet tried_it either
ordering was simple
the kiosk had links to descriptions and stuff
without much going_on in_the_place the folks working_there seemed real busy without accomplishing anything
and_we sort of got ignored for a_few_minutes at_the_counter
and later
while we_were_eating
there seemed_to be_a_bit of swapping of drinks_and things with mi amigo's next door
and at_one point one_of_the employees went around_the_corner and_i_think borrowed some foil pans from someplace
i_like_the idea that friendly competitors will help each_other out
also while we_were_eating the_manager appeared and made_the rounds of the_tables to_see_how folks were_doing
amy chose a butter_chicken wrap and_i_ordered_the butter_chicken with_rice
and_a soda
i don't_eat much indian middle eastern mediterranean food so_i didn't_really have_a_lot to_compare against
my americanized description is marinated chicken with_rice covered_in gravy
the_only difference would_be_the seasonings in_the marinade and_the gravy
it_was_ok and_a change_from some_of_the more common fast_food items
it_was
however
only lukewarm
i_think_that has to_do_with a_couple_of things
the_food_is kept warm in big clay pots and_the choice_of styrofoam plates
styrofoam doesn't handle high heat well but_if they_used paper it_doesn't handle gravies very_well
they can't win on that_one
i_thought the_meal_was priced fairly given the_location and_the prep involved
given_the choice_of a similar cuisine i_would choose pita jungle
that_isn't to_say_i would rule out going back_here_again if_i was in_the_area
this_place_is hip
how do_i know
they followed the code of m
c
hammer
too legit to quit
boooohhhh ring
legit quit
whoa
hip and innovative
i for_one love integers
so imagine my enthusiasm when_they decided not_to open a_hurry for_curry and instead opened a_hurry curry
there's all sorts of reasons feel lukewarm about hurry curry
the self serve touchscreens
are people really that excited_about this
have they_never touched an ipod
i_don't understand the thrill of_being your_own check out person
a_la the grocery_store
isn't_that what_the people behind the_counter are being paid to_do
and_i get_to do_it for_free
a rotating menu
look
i_can't tell vindaloo from biryani from benny agbayani
that's_a baseball zing
so i_don't_have indian_food favorites
but_if i_did
i_think i'd find_it really frustrating if i_went_in and my_favorite thing_was unavailable just_because the_owner cooks are bored
maybe the_prices_are good
maybe they're not
my_meal
drink_and naan_was
rupees
err
excuse me
ten dollars and fifty cents
it_doesn't feel like_a good_deal for fast_food
the postiives
naan_bread_was warm_and delicious
some added variety to_an arizona center devoid of culinary inspiration
people
please stop going_to hooters
two worst meals of my_life
also
did_i_mention this already
they_have_an integer in_their name
it's_not destination dining but a_good break from chain hell
good place_for_lunch
most dishes_are quite_spicy
i wished the_biryani was_a_bit milder
naan_is so_so
i_love_the automated touchscreen order
i_really want_to love_this_place
the_food_is_fresh_and flavorful
the servings are_large enough to_share unless you're really hungry
the_garlic_naan rocks and_the_butter_chicken is_still my_favorite
i_recommend always getting_the rice_with this_dish
well i_always_get rice_and_naan with_this
my_main issue is_still with the_concept
and the_employees while friendly_and willing to_serve still manage awkwardly in_the_kitchen
this visit they_were having_to play catch up_from the_previous shift which leftpots empty_and dishes dirty
it_was delaying the orders
the self serve ordering process is neat o and_fast
but_the_food_is not_good at_all
i_had_the daal
which lacked any trace of_flavor
just imagine some lentils in_a starchy
soupy goop
some salt might have_been nice
any seasoning really
it_was barely edible
with_a thorough dousing of tabasco
the_naan_was in insult to_all that_is naan
instead_of light
fluffy bread
with_a crispy
slightly charred shell
i_got_a tough
greasy
tortilla like thing
slathered in_a butter like substance
two stars_for_the concept and_the really_tasty iced_tea
closed
it_would seem they_did_not pay their rent and_the az center locked them_out
finding something different amongst the hundreds of chinese
indian or italian restaurants_in_edinburgh can_be_a challange however
located near_the city's university
namaste kathmandu may just_be the_place you were_looking_for
specialising in_both indian_and neplaese dishes
there_is no chance of_you not finding something you_want_to_try on either the_main or lunch_time menu's or_at least
thats what_i found
the_daal which i_ended_up settling for way fantastically presented
and thankfully tasted as_good_as_it looked
with_a_large dining_area
as_well_as_a private function room
for up_to thirty guests
kathmandu is a_great_place_for a_different night_out
looking for_something to_eat around downtown edinburgh we_found_this nepalese place among pubs and_food chains
good warm food
at_reasonable_prices
i_had_a mild chicken order_and didn't_get disappointed
when_you there order the_nepalese section of_the_menu as the_indian part you_can find anywhere else
i_really_love indian_food
and_there's nothing_like that feeling of culinary satisfaction when_you're presented with_an awesomely tasty meal
with the_perfect mixture_of flavours_and spice_levels you require for_your fusspot palate
namaste offers up all of_these delightful factors for_your consumption
plus the_food looks great when_it's presented
with_the traditional brass looking bowls and serving spoons
this_is well above_average indian_cuisine
and_really reasonably_priced considering_that fact
i_love_the karahi dishes
and_the classic rogan_josh
but_there_are a range_of both indian and_nepalese dishes_to select from
the_staff at_namaste are_super friendly_and accomodating
and_there's a_fair amount of seating room
although you_might have_to book ahead at weekends
the_interior
although nothing super fashionable or over the_top
is comfortable and feels welcoming
you're also minimal steps away from various grassmarket drinking joints if you fancy imbibing a_few after_dinner
i_first ate at_namaste kathmandu several months_ago with_friends as_we thought_it_was_a japanese restaurant_with it_being called 'namaste'
and so_we_were quite confused when_it materialised that_this_is an_indian and_nepalese place
oh_well
it_was_still a_delicious meal
situated just around_the_corner from the_main university campus george square
namaste kathmandu is_a convenient place_to reach and would_be_a great_place_to_go for_dinner or lunch
namaste katmandu's menu offers a_selection_of authentic nepalese and indian_dishes including dumplings and curry's
and their_menu_is split into nepalese and_indian meals so you_know_what type_of curry you_are ordering
i_had_a nepalese vegetarian soup to_start which_was_really tasty_and clearly made_with fresh_ingredients
for my_main
i_ordered_the fish tikka curry
which_was marinated sword fish and_it_was tasted really amazing
full_of_flavour and_super fresh yum
they_have_a huge selection_of_vegetarian dishes on_the_menu so_there is_something for_everyone
it_is also pointed out on_the_menu which curry's are mild_and which_are hot
which_is incredibly handy and means you won't get_your head blown off with_an unexpected chili
the_prices_are really reasonable at_namaste kathmandu
with_most main_dishes priced_at round eight pounds
a_lovely place_to_go_for gorgeous tasting_food
namaste kathmandu serves excellent nepalese and indian_food
the combination_of these two similar cuisines makes for_a more interesting experience and_you_can compare where the_two types_of food differ
i've not eaten much nepalese_food so i_went_for_the bhute ko kukhura which_was chicken marinated_in a_whole range_of spices
my mate went_for_the fish tikka which looked delicious and_creamy
our_meals seemed_to take no_time to_arrive and tasted_great when they_did
my_chicken was pretty_spicy
but_it also_had an_amazing range_of flavours and_the_chicken_was as tender as i've tasted
our_meals
along_with some boiled rice
cost less_than_a tenner which_was_a brilliant deal considering the_quality_and portion_sizes of_the_food
we'll hopefully be here_again
i_went_here with_a_friend on arriving in_edinburgh and_i'm not_sure where it's because_i_had such_a wonderful experience_at the_amazing gurkha's diner in balham but_i_was unfortunately left a_little underwhelmed
the_food_was_good
i_had_the pudini chicken and_my_friend had_the_lamb palak
unfortunately they_got confused with_our dishes_and announced them incorrectly so_we ended_up_with the_wrong dishes
however
we'd intented to_share anyway so_no bother really but coupled with the_fact_that they brought_us the_wrong side_dishes
it_wasn't so_good
i_always appreciate attentive_service in_a_restaurant but here it_was_a_little too_much_for me
to_check once
maybe twice
during a_meal is_usually enough
however
our waiters checked_in with_us five times_and just made me_feel a_little under pressure
my_friend was performing in_a show a_little later on so_we_decided_to only have_a glass_of_wine each
i_like_to drink but didn't_think the_best_part_of a bottle_of_wine on my_own after_a hour train journey was_the_best idea
however
the_waiter almost told_us off for_not purchasing a_whole bottle which_was a_little_off putting
there's a_good_choice of_food on_offer with_both nepalese and indian_dishes and_all_the food_tasted great_and is_good value_for_money
it's_just a_shame the_service lets it_down a_little
the_food_here was_good bhindi was flavourful
mango_lassi was_just_the right consistency
papamdums and_rice were_good accompaniments
that aside
i_found_the service_here was_a_bit poor and inattentive it took_us minutes_to_get the_bill and_i_found that our_waiter constantly trying_to upsell us on everything from beer to appetizers
felt like eating_at a used car lot
i_have experienced a_lot better_than this
and a_lot cheaper too
our_food_was lukewarm and lacking_in meat
especially for_the_price paid
i'd avoid like_the plague
to_be_honest
the_first_time_i ate_the food_from namaste was by ordering take away i've recently been to_the_restaurant to_eat_in as_well my_opinion about the_restaurant remains unchanged
the_food_is quite delicious_and is_well presented
the_selection_is fantastic as_there is_a_large variety_and had both indian and_nepalese cuisines
the_restaurant could_do with a_bit_of brightening up as it's_quite dim inside
my_only quarrel is_that_it_is slightly pricy and_i_have have better_food for much less
nonetheless it_is different_from the_usual variety that_is available in_edinburgh
i_would_recommend the_paneer makhni and_the prawn malabari
my_favourite dishes yum
one_of_my_favorite restaurant_in_the world
best nepalese hymalayan i ve tried so_far
just beware of_spicy level
it's_very different_from indian cusine
if_you_don't spice a_bit it_is_a_bit too_sweet
like the_decor a_lot
i dropped into tandoori_times one_night after_reading a_good review about_it in_a newspaper
i spent a_few_years in_the_bay_area
where_i became accustomed_to tasty hole in_the_wall indian_food joints rich with sauces_and flavors
the_only_thing they typically lacked
though
was presentation
the_restaurants were often uncomfortable or dirty but
in spite of_that
the_food made_it worth_the_trip
tandoori_times_is unique
first of_all
there_is very_little quality_indian_food in_the_phoenix metro
so_that alone sets it apart
on_top_of_that
its appeal is radically different from_what_i experienced around sf
this place_is_clean_and cool
with sleek decor_and comfortable booths to boot
the_naan_was fantastique
and_the_food_was almost as_good
but_not quite
the richness and abundance of_flavors weren't quite as present as with_their slightly grosser counterparts in cali
not_cheap
but
then_again
hard_to come_by
i'll be headed back the_next_time_i start feeling the need for_some tandoori_chicken_and naan
i_liked tandoori_times
but_it_is just_too difficult to_get_to if_you_don't live in_the_area
i_thought the_food_was_not the normal indian_fare that i_have_eaten
presentation_was stepped up a_bit
food_quality was_great
i_was_a_bit disappointed_by_the selelction of_food
but_i_guess it_is better to_do a_few key things well than offer a_bunch_of variety that_is not_as_good
tables_and booths were dressed up a_bit
i_would return here_if in_the_area
but_otherwise i_prefer maharaja palace
as_i ate my umpteenth takeout meal from here_tonight
mmm
malai_kofta
i_thought_it_was about time for_me_to review this_place
i_really_like it
the_food_at tandoori_times_is just more flavorful than_it is_at many other_indian_restaurants_in phoenix
and_i_believe the_ingredients are of a_better quality
i_do wish_they had slightly more vegetarian_options here
and_i_really wish_they had pakoras on_the appetizer list but other_than_that
i_can't complain
and
while i_like_the place
my_husband absolutely loves it
especially their lamb_dishes
also
i have_to_admit
i'm emotionally attached to_this_place as my_husband_and_i had_the rehearsal dinner_for our wedding here_last october
they were_able_to pull it together for us_with only a_few_weeks notice
our other selection had flaked out_on us at the_last minute
they_were really accommodating when_we_were running late that_night
and_even started bringing out appetizers to_our guests who got_there before us
it was_supposed_to_be a_buffet
but_they_were thoughtful enough_to improvise
everyone loved_the_food
from_the meat and_potatoes midwestern uncles to_the_indian aunties
so_that says a_lot right there
also
their outside patio is_lovely
moved_to n
hayden rd
in_scottsdale
indian_cuisine_is my nose
mouth and eye's favorite food
although my_stomach sometimes would disagree mildly
but i_don't_care
it's_worth_it
upon entering tandoori_times
located next_to_the brand new
forbidden
night club on th avenue in old_town
scottsdale
i notice what i_like_to call an honesty kitchen
the_first_thing i_noticed
was_the familiar fragrances one always smells upon entering and indian_restaurant
i_have_never seen an honesty kitchen in_an_indian_restaurant
it_was_amazing
not_only can_you watch the_chef's skewering the_meats and_vegetables on_the long spikes and placing them into_the enormous tandoor ovens
you_can also see_them do little dances as they_cook
i_enjoyed watching them just a_bit_more than the_belly_dancer
on busier nights
although she_was just darling
i avoided her whenever possible
back_to_the food_you can_find the_usual fare of_naan
tandoori
masalas
chutney as_well_as_a bevy of_vegetarian favorites
each_time_i have_been into the_restaurant i_was met by_the gracious owner
sonny
who_has greeted me kindly
his friendly_and surprisingly knowledgeable staff_are equally welcoming
the_patio is roomy but last i checked
needed some attention
i_would_probably not dine here then go_to forbidden for_all night dancing
but that's_just me
instead
i_would_recommend the_opposite
you_may not find what_you_want at_the clubs
but you_will find_it at_tandoori_times
alas
my craving_for_indian_food came to_the_point where i_had_to breakdown and eat_indian_food on_the_west coast
i'm sorry to_say_that my craving_for_indian was_not met and_the
timing
to_eat_at
tandoori_times
couldn't have_been worse
to start_off my_first sign_of disappointment was_when i_called to_see_if the had a_lunch_buffet
they_didn't
what indian_restaurant doesn't do a_lunch_buffet
well two to_be in exact
which happens to_be_the only_two indian_restaurants_in old_town scottsdale
tandoori_times and jewel of_the crown
which_is where_i work
of_course
the_cuisine
first_off
i'm a_big believer that_you_can judge an_indian_restaurant by their_chicken_tikka_masala
so since this_was my_first_visit to_tandoori
i_had_to_try it
let's just say_it_was okay at_best
the_tikka_masala_was little_bit spicier_than usual
which_is fine with_me
and_it also_had_the right consistency and richness from_the cream you_expect
but_it missed the slight sweetness that contrasts the_spices from_the sauce
disappointing
next was_the_naan
the_naan came out warm_and had_that ever so slight crispy outside that_i adore
but the_inside was slightly doughy or little_too moist
which_made the_naan slightly chewy after it cooled off
it_was_still good
but come_on
you_can at least master the basics right
wrong
let's go_to_the rice
first_and foremost i_don't ever recall where_you had to_pay_for rice at any_indian_restaurant
well guess what
i_did
to_be exact
and_for
did they master this staple side dish
noooo
it_wasn't like_it_was horrible but_i_have never_had_indian rice_that was oily
it_was slight
but you_could taste_and feel it
overall texture_and flavor_was sub par
but_i couldn't get over_the slightly oily taste_and texture
all_i could think was that_i_was eating chinese fried_rice
b c of_the oiliness
with_my tikka_masala
sigh
oh_well
atleast they_gave a hearty portion
decor_was adequate
dark green and red colored sheer covered sections of walls_and was used_a divider to break up the_room
but_what was up_with_the standard white office acoustical tiles in the_ceiling
atleast black it_out like_most restaurants
i_felt_like i_was at work or in_some weird episode of_the office
an episode when steve carell's character
michael
decides to_go_to an_indian_restaurant at_lunch and notices the_same_thing
but_to only make an erroneous comment out loud so everyone in_the_restaurant could here
starts mocking indians and_their accent and_everything then goes down hill
something i_would only laugh if on tv
but_would not_in real life
i_couldn't get over the_fact_that on_top_of_that they_had the audacity to then painted random acoustical tiles dark red and blue
which_made your eyes look up_at the_ceiling
i'm clueless on that_one
anyways
i_am_very hard pressed to_find_a reason to_go_back tandoori_times
for all_you phoenicians you never_had_indian_food
save your taste_buds and go_to nyc or anywhere back east and try_it there
but_if_you get_the urge
i_would_suggest go to_india delhi palace on mcdowell road
the_food_is actually pretty_good
for az standards that_is
more along the lines of stars
okay
so as a_person of_indian descent
i_had_to comment on tandoori_times
it's damn_good
i_took_my parents and friends out_there
we_ordered basically one_of everything_and a_ton_of kingfishers
best indian_beer ever
and spent less than
lunch_is not_too shabby either
any one_of_their wraps hits_the spot
they're extra yummy because they_use naans as_the wrap
my mother
who despises going_to indian_restaurants
even liked_it
i_just went to_tandoori_times tonight for_my friend's birthday and_i_really liked_it
everything_was_delicious
especially the_lamb
and_the_naan_was soo good
the_garlic_naan
the cheesy naan was_a_little bland
the_service_was_good
and they_gave my_friend a_free dessert
i_did think the_restaurant could_have used a_little_more personality
maybe some nicer decorations or better music
but_otherwise it_was_great
would_definitely go_back again
i met a_friend_of_mine here_for_lunch the_other day
she has raved_about this_indian food_place that_she said i_had_to_try
i_used_to live in_the_bay_area of california
and_i_had some_of_the_best_indian_food while_i_was there
so i_was_a_little skeptical that_i_would find something good_here in_arizona
my_friend was_right
the_food_here_is awesome
i_liked_the variety_of naan that_they_had here
from plain to garlic to whole_wheat
we_got_the whole_wheat
which soaked up_the yummy goodness of the_sauce that_came_with my lamb_masala
this_dish was_just spicy_enough
very_flavorful
and_the_lamb_was super tender
my_friend is_a veggie_and got_the dal_makhani
which my carnivorous self actually found quite_tasty
and to_top_it all off
they had_some chai_tea that was_out_of_this_world
it's_a far cry from_the sweetened chai stuff that_you_get at starbucks
very_flavorful
the_service_here was_very great and_attentive
i'm_not sure_how this_place would_be around the_dinner hour
but for_lunch we_were_seated quickly_and served quickly as_well despite quite a_few people being there
i_can't_wait_to come_back
food
everything_i ate chicken_tikka
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_biryani
mattar pineer
lamb_vindaloo
mumbai shrimp
and_garlic_naan_were all great
i drank a king fisher
indian_beer
and it_was_pretty_good
better_than most american bottled beers
mango_lassi_was good
as_it_is in most_places
price
it's about for each_dish
and_for naan
atmosphere
decently nice restaurant
not very_much indian decor
the_music can_get a_little_too loud
right when_i jokingly said
a_belly_dancer should come_out and dance to_this music
one actually freakin did
a white one
it_was entertaining and awkward
but_when a_little girl went_to dance like the_belly_dancer
that_was hilarious
i swear that little kid danced for an_hour straight
service
the_waiter
who i've seen at campus multiple_times
was helpful_and polite
skinny
this is_the_best_indian_restaurant i've_been_to_in the_phoenix_area
i'm going_back_for sure to_satisfy my_indian_food cravings
any place that_has belly_dancers shake their stuff in your_face during_dinner gets high marks in_my_book
i_think the_belly_dancer
s
are there only on_the_weekends around
but you_might want to_check_it_out
loved_the_food
garlic_naan
very_good
the_kitchen is partially open which_is_nice because you_can see_them put the_meat skewers out_of_the ovens
maybe_they call them tandoors or_something
anyways very_good_food
i bit_more upscale than_most other_indian_places in_the_valley
sometimes i_get a_real hankering for_indian_food
we_decided by the_reviews we read to_try tandoori_times
love_it
we've been_back a_few_times since
everything i've tried there i've loved
my_favorite is the_saag ghost
my_only disappointment is_that_they don't serve pakora's at_dinner
and_i never make_it there_for_lunch
but_they redeemed themselves by having one_of_my_favorite white wines on_the_menu
torrontes
the_belly_dancer is cool
just make_sure_you don't sit under one_of_the speakers in the_ceiling
they crank it
definitley one_of_my_favorite restaurants_in_the_valley
tandoori_times never disappoints
their naan_bread_is excellent
any dish i_have_ordered has always_been delicious
tandoori_times_is good for_a romantic dinner or_a casual get together with_friends or family
oh f ck yeah
okay so ive had_indian_food_before
generally the_stuff you_can buy at trader joe's or make can_make at_home
however i_have_never_been to_an_indian_restaurant before
ive always wanted_to try but the_health reports and_the chronic cockroach problems always seemed_to keep_me and_the mr away
after seeing a write up_on chow bella i decided_that i'd take_the plunge
it_was_so worth_the chance
totally clean
super_friendly staff
great drinks_and delicious_food
we_ordered heavy to cross section the_menu
not one_dish sucked out_of_the dishes_that we_ordered
the_rice_pudding made certain parts of_me stand on end
it_was_that good
i'm very_much looking_forward_to coming_here again
if_i_were into_the ladies i_would_have buried my face right into_the belly_dancers boobs
seemed_like the_thing to_do after a_couple_of the_best long island ice teas
since everyone_in my_family digs tandoori_times
i've wandered in_for eight or nine earlybird dinners and
honestly
i'm a_little underwhelmed
definitely not_bad or awful
but maybe if_i sandwiched a later supper between undulating bare bellied vixens and a_couple_of kingfishers
i'd stumble out_with_a hazier
and happier
overall impression
nothing i've ever_eaten here_was truly bad enough_to take back or savory enough_to inspire a return_visit
portions tend_to be small_and sauces_are
by_and large
mild_and rather one dimensional
other_than the_garlic_naan
i_cant remember a_dish smelling really_awesome as_it wafted by
which_is_a shame considering indian_cuisine_is among_the world's most aromatic
i_was eager_to share yesterday's lamb boti kabob
as the_portion_was good sized about small cubes_of lamb
not mega kabob sized cubes
but a_very respectable portion for
on the_usual tandoori bed_of onions_and peppers
the_lamb exterior was_nice crusty
but the_inside wasnt moist_and tender like you'd_expect from tandoori instead it_was hard
chewy and disappointing
companion's entree was tiny vegetable fritters or dumplings buried in_a thick sauce
that_looked more_like an_appetizer
chicken_dishes are generally better the_tandoori version is_good
and similar_to most_indian joints
i_recommend_the three hot relishes
red sauce
green puree
and pickled peppers
provided tableside
as house preparations
at least in my_experience
tend_to be mild
servers_are generally anglo
pleasant_and competent during_the meal
but just_about every_time_we walk in_for_dinner at or
the_entire operation seems almost startled by_our presence
nobody's overtly rude
but instead_of a_really warm welcome
you kind of get four or five employees hanging out at_the_bar staring at you
as_if mentally choosing straws to_see who_has to deal_with the_first dinner customer of_the_evening
it's_not oppressive
but_it's happened more_than once_and i'm_not crazy about_the vibe
i_do like_the complimentary
self serve chai_tea and open kitchen
providing an opportunity_to stretch one's legs and socialize a_bit
nice touches
the menu_is_extensive
all told about sixty items
and_reasonably_priced for_indian_food
indian textiles
jewelry and artwork is often on display
for sale
and the_house music is_too loud if_you_have the misfortune to_be_seated under_a ceiling speaker
it_got turned down
eventually
but any restaurant_with a_few_years under it's belt ought to understand customary american tolerances better_than that
the_atmosphere_is up_and down
food's ok
service is_ok
ask my_family_and they'll each give_it four or five_stars
in_my_book
tandoori_times_is just_ok
well i_am_not the_best person to_ask about east indian_cuisine
it_would not_be on_my list_of top choices
so_that being_said
i_will share my impressions of tanroori times
i_have_been there twice for_lunch
both_times my_party had the_same waitress
and both_times she_was so slooooowwwww
the_second_time she accidentally charged us_for instead_of chicken lunch_specials
we_were honest pointing out_the undercharge
she proceeded_to totally screw up the_change
pocketing the_cash
and_then overcharging the_three debit cards as_if we_did_not supply cash as_well
if i_did_not know better i_would_have said she_was blonde
sheeshh
they desperately need some_sort_of new ventilation system
it smells like_all the smoke from_the_kitchen is_not venting out correctly
the ac is way_too cold
several in my_party were cold
and_the bathrooms were gross
the food_was_tasty
but_i'll pass on_this_one next_time
my belief has always_been that at a_restaurant
nothing matters but_the_food
service_can_be abysmal as long_as the_food_is_good
tandoori_times has changed my beliefs about_this
and_i now realize that service_can_be so amazingly terrible that it_can completely ruin a dining_experience
dinner started innocently enough
we_sat at a_table not far_from the_bar
and_our_server started out asking us_what we'd like to_drink
the_server had_a young kid with_her
maybe years old
and_the kid was helping her with things
i_thought_it was_kind_of strange
but_i assumed it_was probably our server's kid and that_she couldn't find_a babysitter for the_night or_something no big_deal
i_ordered_a dirty martini
and_our_server went back_to_the bar to mix our_drinks
she told_us the_bartender had already gone home_for the_night
even_though_it was_only pm
since our_table_was near the_bar
we_could hear what_was going_on there
and within a_minute or_two
i_heard the_server asking the_rest_of_the staff if_they knew where_the olive juice was
after a_minute or_two of searching
the_staff concluded that they_were_out_of olive juice
at_this_point
i_expected our_server to_come_back_and ask_if she_could get_me a_different drink
she_didn't
instead
she started asking the_staff what she_could substitute for olive juice
and_they concluded that saltwater would_be good
ugh
she_brought me_the drink_and pretended it_was completely normal and nothing_was wrong
i pretended i_didn't_know any better
took_a sip of_the drink
and_told her it_was beyond awful and it_tasted_like they_had used salt instead_of olive juice
she acted like she couldn't imagine why this_was
and_she said_that she would_take the_drink off_of my_bill
when_she picked the_drink up_from the_table to_take it away
the young kid i_mentioned earlier bumped into her and knocked the_drink out_of her hand
she spilled a_bit_of it on_me
and most_of_it on_the_floor
she then walked away and_offered no help of any_kind no napkins or_anything
this spilled drink stayed on_the_floor the_entire rest_of_the meal
and they_never cleaned it_up
when_we eventually left
i_was tempted to
slip
on_it
pretend i severely hurt myself
and start yelling about_how careless their staff_was
how_they could_be held liable for injuries
blah blah blah
i_just wanted someone_to recognize that_it_was ridiculous for_them to_not clean up things that_they_had spilled
but it_really seemed_like they_didn't care at_all
anyway
the_server asked_if_i wanted something else to_drink instead
i_went_for a gin and tonic
when_she got back_to_the bar
the_first_thing i_heard was
what's in_a gin and tonic
how do_i make one
sigh
anyway
the gin and tonic turned_out okay
all_things considered
but at_this_point i_was_pretty sad from_what had already happened
finally
we_got_to ordering our_food
our_server came_over
asked_what we'd like
and_as we_started telling her
we noticed she wasn't paying any attention
she_was just watching her kid and talking to_her
so
we_got_to repeat our_order again
and this_time she actually paid attention and wrote it_down
yay
awhile later
our food_came_out we_got two naans
one paneer
one chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
palak_paneer
and_rice
the_naans were_pretty average
nothing really special
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was actually pretty_good
and was_the_only decent part_of_the whole meal
the_palak_paneer was_some_of_the worst i've ever_had
and_i'm pretty_sure they_just emptied a defrosted bag of frozen spinach over some cubes_of paneer
it_tasted_like no spices or any_kind_of flavoring had_been added
in_the_middle_of eating
we_were interrupted by_the server_and her kid for_a rather awkward moment
the_server made her kid apologize for knocking over my_drink
and_then they walked away
congratulations tandoori_times on making our_dinner that much_more uncomfortable
our_server didn't seem_to care_about anything throughout the_whole meal she never asked_how anything was
if we_needed anything
etc
when we_were_done eating
she came_by and dropped off the_check
without removing our_plates from the_table or_even saying a_word
we_had_been charged an_extra
just to_have rice_with our_entrees
which i_think_is pretty ridiculous
anyway
i_took out_my credit_card and_she came_by to_pick it_up
again without saying a_word
we_left quickly
wanting to_get_our tandoori_times experience over with as_soon as possible
when_we_left
i_was_pretty frustrated and angry
which_is not how one should feel when leaving a_restaurant
i_will_never
ever
ever come_back_here again
check out_their mutter_paneer
and the_curries
complimentary chai just walk up_to_the bar_and serve yourself
order some_naan
excellent paneer wrap with tamarind_sauce
if you're looking_for_good value
check out_their daily specials
small sized entree
side salad
naan
and_rice
for_those with_a sweet tooth
like_me
try_their huge pieces_of gulab_jamun
mmmm
one huge caveat that begs the question of_the authenticity of the_meals served at_this_restaurant the appearance of beef in_the_menu
holy cow
this_is_the main reason i_haven't gone back
therefore
when_i'm dining in_scottsdale
i_am either at jewel of_the crown or indian delhi palace on mcdowell
i_thought this_place_was not_that good for_indian_food
the_place_was not_that clean
overall i_have_had much better pakistani indian_food_and wouldn't really recommend_this_place to_anyone_who would want very_good_food
imagine if you_were pakastani and_you wanted_to open a_restaurant that_would cater_to the mainstream
you_would make_it trendy inside
you_would offer a_nice bar
you_would hire american people as your servers
and_you would_make the_food not so_spicy
in essence
you_would create the pf chang's of_indian_food
you_would give_it an_indian sounding name like tandoori_times and remove any vestiges of pakistan as indian_restaurants_are better recognized and thus seen as_a safer option among_the mainstream
well
that's exactly what tandoor times_is
being_indian
i_prefer indian_food meaning i_like all_the grilled meat items but_they better be_able_to make quality sabjis and vegetarian_dishes too
tandoori_times_is a pakastani restaurant
it's_not an_indian_restaurant
it's almost the_same but_their dishes_are different
pakastani cuisine involves tandoori items_and grilled items
their cooking style is less spicy_and offers less cream in their_dishes
indian
punjani north_indian
food involves tandoor items as_well in_addition_to vegetable_dishes
more variety_and types_of curries_and is spicier and_more flavorful in_general
if_you_are_a non_vegetarian like myself
you_can survive on_the curries and_the shish kebob and_other meat items
however
when_you taste their chaat
deserts and_vegetarian sabjis
this_restaurant clearly does not_know what they_are doing
if_you_are vegetarian of_indian descent
you_will_be sorely disappointed
nothing against pakastani cuisine but vegetarian_dishes are_not your forte much like curries_and grilled options_are not_really a part_of south_indian cooking
the_food_is on_the mild side
of_course
if_you_ask them to_make something hotter
they_can but their_food in_general is_not very_spicy and_is bland with the_exception of some_of their_curries
if_you_are_a non_indian and you_want_to_try indian_food for_the_first_time
this_would_be a_good_place_to start
if_you_are someone who_has eaten quality_indian_food and wants the_real thing
avoid this_place_because this_is as_far from being the_real thing as possible
the_service_and ambience was quite_nice
i_think that's the_real draw of this_restaurant since most_indian_restaurants have poor_service and often a dirty or claustrophobic environment
this_is_a trendy restaurant_in old_town scottsdale that you_could take a_date to
the_service_was_good when_we_went there but_at the_same_time the_servers_were pretty ignorant of_the_menu and_didn't know a_lot about_indian_food
being_indian
this_place_was just a_bunch_of hype
yes
it_was neat to_see friendly american people serving indian_food_since i'm_used_to indian waiters who_are abrupt and to_the_point
i_liked_the ambience but_the_food_was disappointing
their palak_paneer honestly tasted as_if some non_indian person decided_to try_and make_it from_a cookbook at_home
it_was_not spicy nor was_it cooked properly
their malai_kofta_was not_even malai_kofta
let's put_it that_way
i_will_say this
their_tandoori chicke was_probably the_best_i've_had in_the_valley and that's_not suprising since pakastani cooking involves meat and_they know_how_to grill meat well but outside_of their meat_dishes
it_was completely lackluster
the bottom_line is_that if_you_are an_indian person or_a person_who is used_to eating quality_indian_food and you_want honest to goodness quality_indian
not pakastani
food
avoid this_place
if_you_are_a non_indian person wanting to_check_out indian pakastani food and_just want_to have_a_good time
this_place_is for_you
note
however that the_prices_are rather high for_an_indian pakastani restaurant so you_are paying_for that ambience
oh man this_was good_indian_food
coming_from a native
i_hope this means something
another_restaurant close_to_my hotel so_i_decided to_try_it_out on my_way back
ate_at my big fat greek restaurant last_night
to_the room
seating confused me at_first because the_sign said seat yourself but there_was_also_a host directing people_to tables
whatever
pretty extensive_menu
i_ordered_the beef seekh kabab wrap and_the_butter_chicken with_rice_and_a plain_naan
kind of annoying that none_of_the curries come_with rice_or naan
and rice_is
for_a plain_naan
luckily i was_on_the expense account so i_didn't_care about the_cost too_much
food_took a_while_to come_out
but there_was_also_a large_party ahead of_me which got served first
the kabab wrap consisted_of a monster thick kabab
nothing wimpy like_some other_restaurants to with the_usual accompaniments
the_butter_chicken_was thick_and creamy_and the_serving dish_was filled to_the brim
almost overflowing
there_was_a decent amount of_chicken in_there
definitely_not skimpy like many_other restaurants
it_tasted delicious and_no_one seasoning was overpowering
the_portion_was pretty big_and between_the kabab wrap and_the_butter_chicken
two people could easy have_eaten and been satisfied
overall delicious_food_and pretty_good service
they_don't really_have a_full_bar
as_they advertise
there_are maybe spirits with_a_few mixers
and_beer
i_didn't imbibe
but the_selection_was pretty standard fare
rum
scotch
tequila
vodka
and looked decently priced
at least according_to the_drink menu
tandoori_times turned_out_to be_an impromptu valentine's dinner_for my_husband_and_i
we_just usually don't do dinner out_on v day
not_that we_have anything against the_big day
but_my idea_of a romantic dinner out does not involve other couples having their special dinner_at the_same_time
anywho
fondue was_the plan
but_i neglected to_buy anything to_dip into_the imaginary cheese i_also failed to_buy
we settled on tandoori as neither of_us_had been_there
just down_the_street from home
and we_didn't expect it_to_be a_major valentine's destination
i_was_pleasantly_surprised they_were offering_a complimentary rose for_the ladies
complimentary
as_in free
no dude peddling his roses to unsuspecting men who may_have previously neglected the flower ritual and know they_are damned if they_do
like_a rose is_going_to make_up for screwing up_the flower thing
and damned if they_don't
he's so cheap
he couldn't even buy me_a stinkin' rose
nice_touch
no pressure
woman happy
all is_well
we_started_with_the bread basket which_had to_be_a concoction of robert atkins' evil twin
it_had four kinds_of naan
plain
onion
garlic
and_potato
we_ate all we_could and_then some and_still had_leftovers
i_had_the chicken_makhani which_is_a tomato based curry_with herbs and_spices
perhaps a_little_too spicy if_you_can't tolerate any heat
but for_me it_was_perfect
my_husband_had_the lamb_vindaloo
i_tried_it and it_was_a_little too_hot for_me
but it_was_pretty damn_good i_must_say
we_found our_server to_be pleasant and_attentive
i'm sorry we_didn't go sooner
actually we_tried
but_they close between lunch_and_dinner
as they_are moving their scottsdale location to hayden via de ventura
somehow i_think we'll make the_extra effort_to go_again
but_i_will attempt to_avoid the_belly_dancing i've got more_than enough belly of my_own

this_has not_been confirmed as yet
in_any case the_plate containing the reported aloo_tikki was cleaned by_the foursome
several even going so_far as_to swab at_the remaining sauce_on the_plate
the above sources also reported that the_table was_served an_order_of the friday daily special of kahari shrimp
it_was overheard by_a nearby table that the_shrimp was
flavorful with strong notes of_garlic and ginger
this_has not substantiated
however
audrey w reportedly was_served the_lamb_korma which she_was rumored to_have noted was
yummy
carin s apparently was_served the_chicken_masala and donald s may_have been served some_sort_of vindaloo that included potato
it_seems there_was considerable sharing of_the_dishes around the_table_and the_main_dishes may_have been spooned over what some experts have suggested was_a basmati_rice with_various herbs and_spices
an unnamed source has informed this publication that while jim w claims to_have particularly enjoyed_the_food and festive atmosphere which_included a_belly_dancer and_some swordplay
he_was displeased with_the excessive sound level produced by_the in house sound system and_even requested that the_music be reduced
jim w's blog had_a statement this morning that read
in part
ears haven't hurt the_next morning like_that since my_last rock concert
i_really_liked_the food_but i_wouldn't go_back on_a night when they_have dancing again
this_place_has really bad_service
we_waited_for over minutes just to_get_our drink_orders taken
then another minutes_to_get our_food order taken
then over an_hour to_get food
the_food_is okay i've_had better indian_food_in_the_valley
the_atmosphere_is also weird they_have this belly_dancer
who_has bit too_much belly
the_owner walks around whistling and putting dollar bills in the_belly dancer's top
really bizarre
so_not appropriate for families
all in_all
there's better_food
service
and places to_go_for authentic_indian_food
i've been twice_and both_times were very_disappointing due_to poor quality food_and_service
there won't be_a third time
i'll never_go_back again
i_am remiss in not writing my review_of our_dinner tandoori_times a_little sooner
in_my defense
my ears hadn't stopped ringing from the_background music for the_belly_dancer and_i_was unable to concentrate on_the screen long enough to_write a coherent sentence
at least i_think that's why i_can't write a coherent sentence
the beautiful carin and_i met the utterly delightful jim and audrey w
for_dinner at_tandoori_times last friday_evening
i_keep saying it
but one_of_the things_i like about yelp is_actually meeting and getting to_know real people_in
meat world
as opposed_to only getting to_know someone online
it_really gets down_to the art of dining
pleasant conversation with convivial company
good_food_and drink
in an_interesting setting
we_had all of_those things friday_evening
and_more
we_also_had indian_food at_tandoori_times
i_love_indian and pakistani food
i play squash and_i got to_know indian_and pakistani food from_the kitchens of_the wives of some_of_my squash buddies
incredible meals and incredible hospitality
we_could all take lessons
we started_with cocktails
kinds_of naan
the onion_naan was_incredible
crusty and crunchy on_the_outside
literally filled_with chunks_of soft
savory sweet roasted onion
appetizers included aloo_tikki
a potato pancake with gravy
and you_know how_much i_like gravy
good_stuff
we passed things around
family_style
we_ordered dinner as_we enjoyed_our conversations
it_was_great to_get_to know jim and audrey better and_i'm glad we_had_some time_to chat as dinner was_served
really wonderful_food
chicken_vindaloo
chicken_masala
lamb_korma_and kahari shrimp
everything perfectly prepared
spicy and_flavorful
the_service_was warm_and_friendly
all_of_the food_was_served family_style with_rice_and more naan_to sop up_the gravies and_sauces
so_good
then came the_belly_dancing and music
there may also have_been_a fire engine parade and_a boeing landing in the_parking_lot
it_was_so loud we'll never really_know
the sound system was_really cranked for_the lovely belly_dancer and_it_was fun to_watch her for_the_first minutes or_so
but_after an_hour or_so
the fun of watching belly_dancing kind of wore off
we_wanted_to get_back to conversation
even_though_the belly_dancer was brandishing swords and candles
it_was_a_little like watching nascar
you don't_want_to see_the wreck
but_you don't_want_to miss it either
i'm happy_to report that nothing_was cut off or burned during_the performance
sadly
conversation was rendered nearly impossible by the_fact_that someone had turned the amplifiers up_to
jim would ask me
what_do you_do for_a living
and_i_would answer
i sold my motorcycle in
with a_smile
and he_would look puzzled
audrey and carin were having similar difficulties
it's_just hard_to have quiet chat when the_background music is up around decibels
that_said
we truly enjoyed the_evening with_our new friends
and_we really_enjoyed_the_food at_tandoori_times
i_just recommend calling ahead to_ask about the_belly_dancing
and bring_the ear plugs if_you_go on belly_dancing nights
long holiday weekend
sunday_afternoon around
we_finally found_the place_for_lunch it's part_of a
or_so
building complex wrapped around_the back
ok
so_we go_in
it_is completely empty of_customers
nice bar to_the left_with about people who seem_to work there but_we_were ignored for a_few_minutes till someone notices us_and says
oh you_can sit anywhere
so_we do
we_get water immediately
then a_wait of about more minutes in an_empty room
while_the keep on talking
till someone else
our_server
arrives with_more water_and menus
other_than_that it_was_ok
we_had_the tandoori wraps very_good
the_rest_of_the menu looked worth_trying
evidently they_are getting_a new_menu june
interesting concept of_a card that_you_get cash back_on your_food totals ask about_it
the_only_other thing worth mentioning is_that it_would_be nice if raita
even plain yogurt
was free on request
is_a_lot for_it
even_if_you get_a_lot more_than needed
and_they_were out_of_the oz kingfisher bottles
ryan
our_server
was_very_nice
interesting decor
indian but_not cheesy
funny sidebar about a_group_of
highly tattooed
who_had never_eaten indian_food_before and were_given quite_a thorough introduction
always glad_to have_my stereotypes challenged
give_it_a try
the atlanta yelp empress
kathleen m
came_to town this week to_help out_with the_yelp rocks event
so since she's a_fan_of ethnic cuisine
i_decided we'd try tandoori_times
it is_kind_of hidden_in the shopping_center i_suggest they get_some better signage
but we're smart girls
and_we found_it
it_looked pretty dead from the_outside but_once we_were led to a_table
we_saw a_few_other parties dining
including some_friends of_mine on a_date
while our service_was_attentive enough
our_waiter kept attempting to_talk us out_of what_we_wanted to_order and tried_to sell us something different
for example
when_we_ordered the_chicken_tikka_masala
he_suggested we_order chicken chile instead
no thanks
and_when we_ordered_the bengun bhartha
eggplant_dish
he_suggested something else too
we stuck to_our guns though
we_were girls that knew what_we_wanted
in_addition_to the_dishes above
we_shared a house salad
rice
and_a tandoori roti
whole_wheat bread made in the_tandoor oven
we would've ordered an_appetizer of sorts
ie
samosas
but you_have_to do_that during certain times of_the_day and_we missed our window for_that
kind of odd
huh
nonetheless
i_enjoyed everything although_i added a_lot_of hot_sauce it_didn't have_much kick without_it
gotta love_that hot_sauce
i_really_enjoy indian_food_and don't_eat it_as often as i'd_like
it_seems that many_people are_not up_for adventurous eating
i_don't get_it
regardless
i'd come_back to_tandoori_times in_a heartbeat
it_didn't knock my socks off but_it_was_a pleasant experience_with attentive_service
decent ambiance
and moderate prices
thanks_to kathleen m for trying something new with_me
i_visited this_restaurant for_the_first_time last_week
i_can_say_that everything_we_had was_great
i_really_liked our_server
a young girl
or
who knew the_menu so_well and who also told_us of_some special dishes not yet on_the_menu_that we_could order
we_took her advice on_all of her suggestions
and_they_were delicious
it_made dinner that_much better_to try_new_things and_be pleasantly_surprised
an_indian coworker of_mine who_was craving a_little chicken_tikka_masala suggested that_we check_this_place out after yelping it
so_we headed over one_night after work
it_was_a_little hard_to find as_others have mentioned
but we_got_there in_the_end
so_no harm
no foul
a_lot_of my_recent indian_food experiences have_been in strip malls
which_are about_as disasterous as_they sound
so i_was_so thrilled to_be_able_to go
sit down and_enjoy my_indian_food properly
and enjoy_it
i_did
my coworkers and_i started_off with the_bread basket
which our_waiter kindly let us mix n' match
we_weren't thrilled about_the wheat naan
so_he let us switch it_out for an_extra helping of the_onion
garlic or plain_naan
yippee
all_of_the naans_were great
the_onion was_probably_the one_that thrilled me the_least
but it's_hard_to go_wrong with_naan of_any variety
so needless to_say_that when our_food_was gone
the_naan_was as_well
for_our_entrees
we ended_up_going family_style and sharing four dishes
for_three people
the_chicken_biryani
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_makhani and_lamb_vindaloo
they_were_all great
i would_order any_of them_again
but
if_i_had to_choose my_favorite
it_would_be the_chicken_makhani
i_really appreciate that they_use white
good_quality chicken
one_of_the keys to great_indian_food
in_my_opinion
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was also wonderful as_well
but spicier_than the makhani
as_for_the lamb_vindaloo_and the_chicken_biryani
they_didn't do_it for_me quite like the_first two but_i really_have no_complaints about_them
and devoured them in no_time
the_service wasn't super quick
but we'll be_back
after a_great_meal
we_all agreed that_this_place could_easily become_a weekly dining excursion
especially since they_have frequent diner cards
every_time you're there
they_put a certain percentage of what_you spend on_the card
and_then you_can use_it on any future meal
that's fabulous
it's_like free money
what's not_to love
my_wife doesn't like very_hot spicy_food
she enjoys indian_food_and wherever we_have lived in_the_past we have_found great indian_restaurants able to_make her dishes without all_the kick
we_went_here to_check_it_out and_she ordered chicken_tikka_masala_and couldn't eat_it because_of how_spicy it_was
the_manager told her he couldn't make_it less potent or else the_taste would_be sacraficed
well
how did the_other_indian_restaurants outside_of phoenix manage to do_it
not_impressed at_all with_this_place and won't be_going back
gabi k was sweet enough to_cater_to my_indian cravings and_we ventured out to_tandoori_times on_my never ending quest for quality chicken_tikka_masala
as_we scanned the_menu
i_was_disappointed to_see_that a_large portion_of their options were_only available during_lunch time
get separate menus so_i'm happily oblivious to what_i'm missing
i_am_a chicken_tikka_masala girl through and through
while_i may order other_dishes in_addition_to ctm
i_have_to get_it at every indian_joint i_go_to
yes
yes
i_know_it may_not be the_most_authentic thing
but i_don't_care
i_love_it
so_don't you dare try to_talk me_out of_it
and_that's exactly what our_waiter did
which made_me nervous
was_the ctm all that_bad
no
it_was fair
but_the waiter's attempt to lead us down a_different road makes_me wonder if they_really do_have wonderful_food here
it's_just_not ctm
try it_out
and_go with_their recommendations
yay
i_am a_big_fan
i_am obsessed with_their chicken_makhani
aaahhh the_naan_is always so_good i_prefer the_plain
so_happy they_serve samosas anytime now
i_haven't found better_indian_food anywhere in_phoenix
man
when_my ex bf used_to work there he_would always bring home the_best_food
i_love_their channa_masala and lamb_saag
they_also have some_of_the best_naan around
if you_do get dessert
the ghulab jamen is insanely sweet
but_their kheer hits_the spot
was fully craving_indian
and_was fortunate enough to_be directed here by a_few friends that_have recently moved_to the_states from_india
can't stress enough how_good this_place_is
complex flavors_and delicious sauces
service_was_great
portions_were solid and price_was right_on
and
if_you_like spicy
you're_in luck
go_for 'chef hot'
they_don't hold back
definitely part_of_the regular rotation moving forward
we dropped a_party_of on_them
last minute
not_too far_from closing time and_the_service_was amazing
the_server_was excellent
her suggestions were right_on
and_she even offered to_take_a dish back when_she noticed one_person in_the party was surprised_by_the spiciness_of her dish
this person didn't complain about the_dish
the_server just noticed_the look on her face and_offered to_take it_back
zeeeeee food
so_good
so
good
i_would_give this_place stars
but_i did_not_have a_chance_to have_any appetizers_and rate them with the_whole meal
so_it's my fault
i_will just_have to_go_back_and edit my_review
fin
i_went_to tandoori_times today for_lunch with six of_my co_workers for_lunch
it_was_not the_best_indian_food_i've_had
but_it_was definitely_not the_worst
i_had_the achari lamb lunch_special
but my_experience there_was horrible
my issue with tandoori_times was the_service
our_waitress did_not seem_to care_about our_table at_all
even_though_we were_the largest party in_the_place
maybe she felt that_she did_not need_to work for_her tip since_it_was automatically added_to our bill
she never checked_on us to_see_if we_needed anything
one_of_our party members even_had to chase her down just find_out where his_food was after everyone else's food_had shown up minutes_before
she_had issues with_our check_and stiffed us on_our change
i bill_was
three people put_in
another a
and three people asked_her to charge a_piece on_their credit cards
that totals
we_asked_for change_from_the cash
she came_back with_no change and walked away
as_we_were already minutes late from lunch and_were in_a_hurry we_left
but_she swiped a
tip
even_though_the food_was_good
the_service_was the_worst i_think i've ever_had
i will_not_be_returning to_this_restaurant any_time soon
finally in north scottsdale
a_great_indian place
our friend_who grew up in_london recommended t t and_we wern't disappointed
the_best lamb_saag i've_had and_our friend always gets the tiki_masala
excellent_service and happy_hour drink prices before pm
my question is_where is the_garlic in
garlic_naan
badger out
its hard for_me to_give_this restaurant_a higher star_rating
this_is_not due_to_the food by_any_means
the_food_is_excellent and_very genuine
i_do however
take issue with_the_service
everyone_is pleasant enough
but none_of_the wait_staff or take_out order employees seem_to_have any concept of_time
i_have dined in at_the_restaurant for_lunch a_couple_of_times with_other colleagues
we_have_a typical hour lunch break and_this establishment is_a mere mins away
lets just_say both_times we_told the_server we would_be in_a_hurry due_to work and_both times_we were_at least to minutes late
lesson learned
so_we resorted to calling in_our order_for pick up
we_were_told it_would_be ready in mins
that_was_a sheer fabrication as both_times we_arrived and paid and_waited for_another minutes_for_our food_at_the pick up window
aka bar
now
why do we keep giving_them another_chance
well
that's simple
it is_the_only authentic_indian_food in a_mile radius
trust_me
if_we_had other options we'd take them
bottom_line
great_food
crap service
hard place to_find
but fairly delicious_and affordable
my_friends_and_i go_here
we like_it
i_love_this_place
every_time i_have_a craving_for_indian_food this_is where_i go
even_though_i now live about_minutes from_here
the_service_is_always great
and_the_food
oh it_is wonderful
i_usually order the_chicken_tikka mahsala
or the_chicken mahkni
they are_both so_good
i_also love their_naan
i've_been_to a_few_other indian restaraunts in_the_valley
al of which_were claimed to_be
the_best_indian_food_in phoenix
but_this truely is_the_best in_phoenix

full review
well all_the_indian reviews from_the buffay crew finally_got to_me_and i_had_to have_it for_a cheat meal
was_like mr toads wild ride in_my truck getting here
a_quick u turn
brake check
sharp right
up_a ramp and into_a parking place
that complex is_like_a maze and_i feel lucky that_i located my destination
walked_in the_yelp stickered door_and was hit with_that delicious indian_restaurant smell
what was_lacking was_the scent of mesquite which you_can usually pick up_at most_places from the_tandoor
this_was an upclass place_so i_figured it_was_just vented well
the_place_was really cool on_the_inside having this upscale lounge type feel
nice_and dim and_easy on_the eyes
the_guy who_was double duty as host waiter seemed a_bit annoyed that_i_was walking_in the_door at
when they_were open until
a_tad on_the snooty side asked_if_i was picking_up or eating in with_a heavy insinuation that_i better be picking_up
luckily i_was saved by my_phone going off as my_friend couldn't find the_place
i_got to bark two for_dinner_and walked out the_door to_find my_friend
was_happy when our_waitress came to_the_table since i_didn't_want much to_do_with the_host
she took our_drink order_and asked_if_we needed a_few_more minutes_to which_i made_the mistake of replying yes
normally i_have these meals pre planned and know exactly_what_i want but this_was_a last minute change of destination
i regretted not ordering right then because_we didn't_see her again for_a_long while
my_friends have learned that i_usually know what's good and_just let me order_for the_table
one_of_them was_an appetizer_and as_usual i_was asked_if_i wanted that first or with_the_meal
i_try and condense the_time that_i'm eating bad_food to limit the sugar spikes it_might create
i'm not_even sure why they ask because out_of times they_bring it first anyway
this_was_one_of those times
we_waited_for what seemed_like an eternity for_this one_dish to show up
at_that point i_just started eating because_i_was super hungry
the_rest took another minutes_to_get there
kitchen here_is realllly slow and_we_were one_of only tables
one_more note
do yourself a_favor and get_a_table
the booths here_are horrible
they press you forward into the_table_and are_very uncomfortable on_the back after a_while
and_you_will be_there a_while
p
food details
onion_bhaji
i_ordered these thinking they_were something different
they_were basically battered onion strings with what_i_would guess was_a plum based sauce
i_was_expecting the_indian fritters that i_couldn't remember_the_name_of at_the_time
it_was_still tasty
bread basket
sampler of different_types_of naan
the_only_ones i_would_recommend are the_onion and_garlic
in the_rest the_texture was_a_little different but no_flavor profile change and rather dull
chicken_tikka_masala
mmmm i_love_this dish and_it_was_pretty darn_good here
i_have_had better but_it_wasn't in_the_valley
i_haven't chowed on much indian since returning here_many years_ago
saag_paneer
texturally this_was way off from_what i'm_used_to
it_was_almost like_a ground spinach
the_spice profile of_the_dish was_excellent but i_was_a_little disappointed_in the_paneer
this_isn't a_strong cheese anyway but_this really_had no_flavor to_it
i'm_used_to it adding at least a_creamy richness to_the dish
this_one had the_taste texture of firm tofu
tandoori_chicken
i_was_really craving_some tandoori_chicken_and i_was_disappointed
it_wasn't_bad but_it lacked the bold flavor depth this_dish usually has
i_also totally missed any mesquite wood smoke flavor that_should have_been_there
between the_lack_of wood taste_and smell i_think_this place may use_a gas driven tandoori verses a_real mesquite charcoal version
kheer
rice_pudding is_great stuff and adding almonds and raisins to_it
yum
this_is where someone played a cruel joke on_us
the_dessert glass was_an odd shape and_the spoon didn't fit all_the_way
if you wanted_to retain your manners there_was of_the dessert you_were unable to reach
manners were tossed out the_window
i_agree fully with_the stars this_place_has averaged for itself
i made_the mistake of trusting some_friends over trusting yelp
i_could_have done much better that_night but_this_was a_ok and tamed the craving
we_felt very rushed towards the_end_of_the dinner to_pay and get_a move on
we_were_there in plenty of_time to_eat_and leave before closing had this_place operated at_a normal pace
just remember
if_your friends had_good taste
they would_be yelpers
one_of_my_favorite_indian restaurants
i_have_a half dozen indian coworkers and_it_is also one_of_their favorites
lunch typically has a_plate_of salad
rice
bread
orders diverge depending on main_dish based on lamb
chicken
or vegetables
plus a_bowl_of a lentil_soup
been_there once for_dinner with_a_group_of people
food_was_served indian family_style and_kept coming until everybody had_enough
outdoor seating is_nice
before weather turns to hellacious
and is_well away from traffic although a_little_too close_to a_large parking_lot
still very_nice
food_is_great
service_is not so_great
if_you_can handle waiting for_a_while for your_food
water
and the_check
then this_place_is_good
ambience_is okay not_really fancy
but the_food_is_good
they_have_a belly_dancer on weekend nights
which_is interesting
a_bit weird actually and_it's loud so you_can't hear very_well if_you_want_to converse with your_own dinner party
i was_excited_to_try tandoori_times as good_indian good_food can_be hard_to come_by here in_arizona
i_was even_more encouraged when_i walked_in_and found an almost exclusively indian
appearing
clientele
to begin
the_service_was a_little_off
there_was maybe people in_the_restaurant yet we_waited a_full five minutes or_so for_a greeting
when he_did come_by
he_asked if_we_were ready_to order and_i looked_at him and_said
you_know
we might need_to look_at_the menus first
perhaps he's used_to
regulars
anyway
we began with_the onion_bhaji
essentially an_indian version_of onion rings
and raita
a cucumber
potato
mint_and yogurt_sauce
the onion_bhaji looked good in_all its fried glory
but was_so heavily battered my_wife_and_i both felt ill after trying a_few pieces
you_could not_taste the_onion at_all
major disaster
the_waiter began_to redeem himself by noticing that_we_had hardly touched it_and offered_to take_it off_the_menu
the_raita was_fresh_and flavorful_but didn't exactly fit with anything we_ordered and a_recommendation of_what to_eat_it with would_have_been helpful
we also_ordered the_naan_and simply put it_was killer hot
light
wonderful
first score at_tandoori_times
my_wife ordered the_chicken_makhani and_one sampling_of the_sauce had us both oohing and ahhing at its rich
buttery flavor
nothing to_say here_again but killer
i_ordered_the_lamb korma
and though i_found_the dish to_be decent
it_was_just very plain when compared_to_other_indian dishes i_have_had that_just burst with varied bold flavors
i_also asked that_it come spicy
out_of
but instead it_came_with no_spice at_all
while my wife's dish came pretty hot_and was_supposed_to_be mild
i_wouldn't order again_but it_may be right_up someone else's alley
finally
we_ordered a_plate_of rice_to accompany our_meals
the_rice looked and_tasted like it_had_been sitting around since yesterday
and_maybe it_was
my_wife grew up_on rice_and loves it more_than she loves me
so when_she frowns at_the sight and scowls at the_taste_of_the rice
it_is bad rice
i_could justify giving tandoori_times less than three stars but something tells me another visit may render us happier customers
i'll try_it_again
but_only one_more time before_i chalk it up_to
just another indian_place
where the_food_and_service simply fall short
the_food_was_excellent
the_lamb chop appetizer was_incredibly flavorful
although it_was_a_little gristly
the bhindi_masala is among_the better bhindi dishes i've_had
i_still can't place the_extra spice they_put in_it
the_saag ghosht was_superb
just really an_excellent lamb_dish
tender lamb_and mildly spicy spinach gravy
and_of_course the_chicken_tikka_masala_was solid
and tt serves gajrela
an_indian carrot pudding
it's_been a_few_years since i've_had gajrela
i_still love_it
service_was_friendly_and speedy
the_belly_dancing with_the sword was unexpected
my_only concern with tt is_that if that_was its saturday_night rush
then i_hope_they are making_it up during_lunch
the_place_was only full
my_wife_and_i were_looking_for a_good_indian_restaurant in_scottsdale and_came across tandoori_times thanks_to yelp
the_reviews were positive
service_was question mark
we_were prepared for the_wait
we_went_on sat
night at
and_sat right down
we_were well fed and walking out_in just_about an_hour
the_service_was_friendly and_great
the_garlic and_onion naan_were great_as recommended
so_was_the chicken_tikka_masala_and lamb_saag
we_are locals and like_some spice_in our_food
we_are used_to ordering spicy mexican and it_being just_right
we_did the_same here
wow
they meant it
loved_it
but had_a_nice sweat going
we_were_told after that mild is_a on spice meter
what_we_had was_out_of
you_might try mild first trip
i_did_not give_stars due_to that being_a rare mark
for off_the chart experience
like the_old sea saw or binkley's
we_left with_a_great dinner experience_and a_take_out menu
we will_go_back
maybe mild next_time
maybe_i was lucky
maybe_i was_just too desperate for_a_good_indian meal
i_don't_know
but_my experience_here was_fabulous
i_can't in good conscience give_it_a star_rating because_i know of better_places in ca
but_on a_scale_of 'phoenix area' indian_places
this_would get_a star_rating no problem
i've been_looking_for a_good_indian place_for over_a_year
and i_saw this_place over a_year_ago
but decided it_was_too 'fancy'
and could_not rationalize a_good indian_place_in such_an upscale
suburban setting
so_i kept passing it_up
in_the meantime
i've_been_to mesa
tempe
and chandler in_search_of the solution
most times
i_don't_even walk_in the_door
i'm sorry
but as_a lone diner
i'm_not interested in being the_only patron at pm
plus what does that tell you about_the_food if no_one is_there
i_walked into tt at
pm on_a_friday_night and_it_was busy
that_was_a big plus
and most_of_the patrons looked indian another big plus
for_some_reason i'd gotten it into my_head that this_was_a fancy spot
but in_fact
the_interior_is simply 'nicely done'
head and shoulders above most_indian_places for_sure
but definitely_not stuffy or over fancy
many_people have mentioned the incredibly slow_service
my waiter is maybe a_yelp reader
because_he told_me
these tandoori appetizers shouldn't be called appetizers
they_should say
' minutes_to cook'
he_suggested i get_my tandoori appetizer at the_same_time as_my main_dish good advice
i_had_the goat_curry
which_was outstanding
and_the_tandoori lamb_chops which_was not perfect way_more pieces than_i imagined
but thinly sliced
and not_as juicy as_i_had hoped
the_rice_was absolutely perfect basmati_rice with_some whole cloves dotted throughout
the_naan_bread_was also perfect really
really perfect
and_made the_meal a_perfect treat
just_as my_meal arrived
boom
the_music got loud and_out jumped
a_belly_dancer
this_was not_what i_was_in the_mood_for
and at_first i_felt the_evening was ruined
but_she was_good
and_really 'worked the crowd' as_it were
and_made an effort_to engage everyone
some tables got_up and danced with_her
leading to a_rather festive atmosphere
overall
a_plus
but_i'm glad it was_only_one reasonably short session
in summary good_food
nice_place
nice_atmosphere
and head and shoulders above anything else i've_found in_the_phoenix metro so_far
eastern edge i_don't get over_to the_west
i_have_eaten there a_couple_of_times
nice
friendly_staff
good reasonably_priced food
one_time i_ordered_a meal that_was so hot
spicy
it_was_almost uncomfortable to_finish eating
other_than_that
good_experience
great_food
loved the_chicken_curry
although relatively low on spices to tone it_down a_little
it_had all the_flavors that_i_would get_back in_india
was_completely surprised with the_belly dance
was_pretty neat and_a_nice show
overall excellent_food and_really close_to authentic
would_love_to come_back
this_is_definitely the_best_indian_restaurant_in phoenix
the_tandoori_chicken_and aloo_tikki wraps are to_die_for
you_cannot go_wrong with_this_place
after my_first good_experience
i've been_back at least times
each time
the food_has_been awesome
the friday special 'goat curry' is_great
and_the saturday special beef stew is also_great
the rice_and_naan are_always perfect
and_the condiment they_bring out with_the papadums
a ginger based pickle
is_fabulous
the_service one_night was laughably bad really
really_bad
and_other nights
not perfect
but the_atmosphere
decor
and_food make_it a_real discovery
good_food
we_have had_a_lot_of indian_food_in montreal and_in the_uk
this_one_is above_average by international standard s
the_service though is_a_bit disorganized and_i_would the_belly_dancer and_the loud music for_something more quaint
but_overall worth repeat visits
the_food_here_is delicious
goa prawn curry
tandoori_chicken
lamb_tikka_masala
garlic_naan
tandoori shrimp app
cocktail samosa app
lamb seekh kabob app
slow_service
but_that's how most_of_the indian_restaurants i_know are
authentic
salty
tamarind_chutney on_point
my boss took_me out_to lunch here_once
and i_was_very pleasantly_surprised at_the flavor_and price_of the_lunch_specials
mostly everything i_have_tried at_tandoori_times has_been good
the_naan_is so_fresh_and warm
and when_you request spicy
that's what_you_get
enter the_mango_lassi
which is_really_good
it helps cool your_mouth when_you're eating something fiery
the_only_thing_i have_a complaint about are the_tandoori appetizer wings
as_there was_less meat on_them than i_have_seen on any chicken wing
plus it_was way_too spicy
i_also felt like was_way too_much to_ask when you_have_to basically get_your nutrition from_the dish by sucking on bones
but
hey
who am_i to_judge
right
had they toned the_flavor just a_bit_on that dish
i_might have_given it_another try
however
bleeding from_my esophagus is_not how i'd_like_to spend my lunch_hour
aside from_the wings from hell
i_love tandoori_times
it_is authentic
affordable and right around_the_corner from_my job
stars
love_this_place
very beautiful decorations
and_they_have belly_dancing on_friday nights
very_reasonably_priced considering the_ingredients that it_takes to_make indian_food
the_only_thing i_didn't_like about_their dinners is_that you_have_to order the_rice separate from_the entree
but_still very_good
try the_samosas
thoroughly impressed with_this_place
we_were_in for_dinner_on a wednesday and the_dining_area was_crowded and vibrant
the_decor_is better_than average for_an_indian_restaurant
the_service_was superb and_he_was honest with_his opinions
he_told us not to_order_a certain dish
the_food_was_awesome and_the complimentary chai_tea warmed me_on the_cold night
i_strongly recommend_this_place
not too_expensive considering the_location
my_friend suggested that_we start our saturday_night here_before heading out to_other halloween festivities
besides feeling completely out_of place in_our halloween costumes we_had_a_great time
it's_a pretty low key place and_it sits towards the_back_of this shopping complex so unless_you know_where you're going you_would never find_it
we_had_a_great experience since my_friend personally knows one_of_the_owners
we_sat on the_patio and started_off with drinks_and hookah and_we_were given some great_suggestions for_food
i_decided_to go_for_the chili prawns and_garlic_naan and_a_side_of the_basmati and saffron rice
i'm_still drooling thinking_about this_food
it_was so_fresh_and flavorful
i_couldn't stop_eating
the_sauce the prawns came_in
man was_it tasty
after hookah
drinks_and this delish food my girls and_i got_up danced a_bit with_the resident belly_dancer inside of_the_restaurant
overall it_was_a_great experience
we_felt like we_were part_of_the family
great_service
great ambiance_and perfect_for dates or family night
if_i_lived closer i_would_definitely be a_regular
we started_with aloo_tikki
it_was_good but i_don't_like one_of_the spices in_the garbanzo beans
the aloo_tikki last_week in west palm
fla
was infinitely better
i_had chicken_korma which again had_that taste i_am_not too keen on
similar_to nutmeg or cloves
which i_have_not noticed in_any korma i_have_ever_had previously
the_korma sauce was_very thick_and i_liked_it but_it_was much thicker than the_usual korma sauce in_most other_places and_although it_was_good and certainly quite different
i_think_i prefer the_usual consistency
but_it_is nice_to have_something different for a_change
the_onion naan_was possibly a_little underdone and slightly doughy
though it_too was_good_and i suspect it_was_not so_much underdone as that_this_is the_way it_is served at_this_restaurant
what_was over was taken home_and certainly thoroughly_enjoyed the_next_day so_it's fair to_say_i would recommend_this_restaurant
my chief complaint would_be_the noise
when_we_walked_in we_were pleased to_see_that there_were many_indian customers
always a_good_sign in_an_indian_restaurant
but_it_was noisy and the_most noise came from_a crying baby
this_is_not_the baby's fault i_wish people with_very young children would_have the decency to_do what_i did when_my kids were young
leave them at_home
many_people say_that if_you_can't afford to_leave at least a tip then you_can't afford to_eat out
i_think if_you_can't afford to_find_a babysitter so_you_can enjoy your evening_and in particular so_you_can not spoil the_evening for others
then please stay home
as_usual
the_people with_the baby were impervious to its crying
they_were obviously so accustomed_to it_that it_does not bother them
i_am_not_sure whether to hold this against the_restaurant
they_could have_asked the_people to_take_the baby outside until it settled
but_it_was cold outside_and i_wouldn't want_to make them do_that to_the kid
it's_a difficult situation for_the resaurant but if_i go_again and the_same_thing happens again i_will mark it_down as a_family restaurant_and keep away when i_don't_want_to deal_with the noise of babies crying
ate lunch there after about_a two mile walk_from the hyatt at gainey ranch
very_good_food
reasonable_prices and_a lunch_menu with_various specials for each day_of the_week
complementary chai
waitress_was very_pleasant and_helpful
the_restaurant_was quite clean as were_the bathrooms
would_recommend
lunch_menu choices were limited to six entrees
this_was_the_first indian_restaurant_i have ever_been_to
as_it_was recommended_by some_friends
they_do_have belly_dancer on saturdays
which definitely was_not part_of my plan for the_evening
the_music_was extremely loud and annoying
since_we_were sitting right below the speakers playing obnoxiously loud music
we_asked to_be moved_to a_different table
which did_not help
fortunately it_only lasted a_couple more songs
they_do offer variety_of naans in_the_menu
and_i asked_if_we can_have a platter to try_different versions
and_the_waiter said they_do_not offer platter type assorted naans
pretty annoying as time went by_and i_saw that_they_do offer_a platter with variety_of naans
i_guess my fault
i_should of read_the multi page menu
i_wish_they had pictures in_the_menu
which will help if not_familiar_with the_cuisine
we_ordered_the yellow curry_and chicken wrap
chicken wrap was_just_a wrap
nothing_special
yellow curry was_cold
not_even room temperature
but cold
wasn't_too happy about_it
prices_are_reasonable
can't expect more
i_really_liked_the variety_of spices_in the_rice
definitely new to_me
i_really_liked this_place
the_only_reason_i didn't give_it stars was the_waiter
who was_extremely nice
was_a_bit inattentive
we_had_to wave him over quite a_few_times
the_staff was_extremely_friendly
the_music was_nice_and ambient
not_too loud at_all
i went_on_a weeknight
when_there is_no belly_dancer or loud music
the_food_was_really_good
and_this_is coming_from a picky eater who_is not_a_huge_fan of_indian_food
the_dessert was_awesome
and_overall
for_the enormous amount we_ordered for_people
i_have plenty of leftovers
the_price_was fairly good
i_was_surprised at_how low the_check was
i_will
say
though
it_was_a_little hard_to find
it's off in_the_back corner_of the complex
go_with_the lamb lunch_special here
chicken is_also acceptable
you_will_not_be_disappointed
indian_food_is not_my_favorite but_i_think this_is_the_best place_for it in_scottsdale
i_really_love their_chicken_tikka_masala
i_also think they_have great_naan and_i_like that_they_have a_variety_of flavors
excellent chai_tea which_is free and unlimited
they_have lunch_specials
which_is also nice
or you_can_order anything off the_dinner_menu all_day but_you will_have_to split it_with someone because the_portions_are huge
last_night i craved indian_food_and logged on to_yelp for help
my very favorite_place is miles away_and i_wanted something nearby
i_found tandoori_times and arrived there_at pm
i_couldn't believe_that at pm there_were people ahead of_us waiting for_a_table
a_good_sign
i_thought or
poor management that can't handle a crowd
someone who appeared_to be the_owner_was busy working to_see_that everyone got a_table quickly
we_got_a table in_minutes in_a_small room they_have in_the rear of_the_restaurant
within minutes we_got_a waitress and placed our_order
she_brought us condiments
a_red spicy_sauce
coriander chili_sauce and_a spicy_sauce made_with marinated ginger bits
no papadums
most restaurants give_you papadums
we missed them
my_order of chicken_vindaloo was_absolutely delightful spiced just as_i requested hot
our double order_of bread came hot_and delish
we don't_eat rice
my husband's lamb_tikka was generous_and nicely done
during our_meal
the_belly_dancer started her act
this meant that_the loud music would soon begin
and i_mean loud
i_don't_know_if it_was_that we_were_in that small room
but_my eardrums were_about to burst
there_was no relief until we_ended our_meal
the_belly_dancer could_not be seen from_our room so_we stood up_to peek at what_was going_on
it_was_an attractive young lady
dressing in belly_dancing garb dancing to_indian pop music
not_really belly_dancing
i've done belly_dancing myself
next
dessert
i_ordered_the kheer
it was_absolutely_amazing
it_was creamy with sliced almonds and raisins
probably one of_the_best_i've_had anywhere
i_gave tandoori_times stars_because the_music_was too loud and_it kind of spoiled the_experience for_us
other_than_that the_food_is_really authentic_and delicious
i_hope that the_management will consider toning down the_music at least for_the poor people in_the_back room
i_would_never accept a seat in_that room when_i return
and
i will_return
service_was_good
food_was_good
the dancing and music_was atrocious
i couldnt enjoy_the_food due_to_the ridiculous music volume
other_than_that
pretty_good
they_were nice when they_brought_out my birthday cake
i_have_been a_regular for_years and i_really_like_the place
but last_night was_a disaster from start to_finish
the_waiter had_no business being_a waiter
the_food_took quite a_while_and came out lukewarm
all_of_it
the_main_dishes
the_rice_and the_nan
i_made them aware and they_brought back another round of_dishes they claimed to_be fresh
not_just original dishes heated up
same temperature and virtually no spiciness
we are_usually asked_how spicy we_like our_food
the_waiter never bothered to ask_us
it_was as_if the_place changed ownership and the_new team was that_day trying_to figure out how to_cook and run a_restaurant
i_made management aware and received off the_bill
still not_sure when or_if i'll be_back
great_indian_food
much better_than usual indian_places coming_from an_indian
stars_for good_food but crappy service
i_was raised on_indian_food
and know_what_i like
i_heard that tandoori_times was_a_great restaurant
so my_boyfriend_and_i decided to_eat_there a_few_weeks back
i_had_been looking_for_a new_indian_restaurant and was_excited_to_try it_out
the_restaurant_was busy
and we_waited about_minutes until a_table was_available
we_were_seated on the_patio behind a pillar
bad idea
our_server came_over after a_few_minutes to_take_our drink order
he came_back with our_drinks
and_we_were unsure as_to what_we_wanted to_order for_dinner but we_ordered_the aloo_tikki to_start
the_appetizer took a_long_time to_come_out
about_minutes
and_our_server didn't come_back to_take_our_order until shortly before our_appetizer arrived
we_ordered_the bengun bhartha and_chicken_curry with_garlic_naan
another or_so minutes went by after we_were finished with our_appetizer before we_saw our_server again
he set our_dishes down and_asked if_we_wanted anything else
i_asked_if we_could_have a_side_of_rice because_i just guessed that_he had forgotten it
or it_was on_its way as_all indian_places i_have_been_to serve rice as_an accompaniment to dishes
i_told my_boyfriend i_didn't_want to_eat my_meal without rice
so_i waited about_minutes
no rice
our_server continued serve other_tables and walk_away before my_boyfriend could flag him down
finally
i_decided_to not let_the already mildly cool food get colder
so_i reluctantly began eating
the_curry tasted_great and_was well_spiced
i_also loved_the bengun bhartha
i_have_only found one place_that makes_it the_way i_like_it
after we_were_done eating_the two_dishes
the_server finally came_over
no rice in hand
to_ask how our_meal was
my_boyfriend politely asked_for boxes
our rice to_go
since they_seemed to_be still cooking it
and the_check
we_waited another or_so minutes_to_get our bill
and_the_server says
don't worry_about the_rice
it's on_me
what
we_actually have_to_pay extra_for rice
my_boyfriend got_up and_went looking_for the_manager
he spoke to the_hostess and found_out the_manager had stepped away
but_she called and spoke to_him
my_boyfriend explained our_experience
and how_it was_our_first_time dining there
the_manager said_that we_would either wait_for him to_return
or the_hostess could take off our bill
not wanting_to wait any longer for_anything else
my_boyfriend just asked_for_the discount
the_food_was_great
but_the_service_was crap
absolute crap
unfortunately
due_to that first impression
i_don't_want_to go_back
this_is_the_only india restaurant in_az that_doesn't disappoint
we_have_been there a_few_times_and the seekh kababs and_chicken_tikka have always_been excellent
the_food takes a_while_to come_out
but_then it_is fresh_food
fresh_food takes time
the_service_is_good
went_there with kids once not realizing that_they_have belly_dancing that_was embarrassing
take_out food_has_been disappointing as_well
now we_always dine_in
avoid weekends
and_make sure we_have plenty of_time to_wait_for enjoy_the good_food
i bought some frozen indian entrees from sunflower market and_it reminded me_of_the time i_ate_here
my boyfriend's parents were_in town_for spring break this year and_i_had been_wanting_to try_this_place out_for quite some_time
so_the four_of us grabbed an_early dinner after watching the a's beat_the white sox
i_should_have known it was_going_to_be a poor experience when_we drove up and_saw how
fancy
the_outside was
our_waiter_was rude
and_when taking our_order he dropped the
empty
tray once
there were_only a_couple_of other_tables with_people at them
so it_was_pretty loud
when_our food_came
the_waiter dropped my_plate on_the_table
and my_food got all_over_the table
my shirt
and_even my purse
he_brought me napkins a_few_minutes later so_i_could clean up his mess
and dropped his empty tray yet again
it_took him forever_to bring_us the_bill
or extra naan
or_anything we_ordered
each time we_waited
i_looked over at_the_bar and_he_was just standing around drumming his fingers
the_food_was_very bland
even_with a_ton_of heat spice
the blandness overpowered everything
my boyfriend's mom is_not picky at_all
but she_could not_eat her food
the_only_reason i'd even give_this_place one_star is the_mango_lassi_was delicious
the_naan_was_good
and_my_boyfriend and_his father really_enjoyed their huge taj mahal's
i_give up
i once loved the_food_and_service here_but both have deteriorated to_the_point of no return
at least my return
once you_get past the lackluster service you_get mutter_paneer with_peas tasting like they_just came out_of_a can and chicken_tika_masala so bland i_didn't ask_for cartons for the_leftovers
serving the tika_masala at near room temperature didn't do_it any favors
go find indian paradise in_the airpark
while they_don't_have belly_dancers they_have cricket on the_tv and truly terrific indian_food
having been a_big_fan_of tandoori_times when_it_was in old_town
i_expected the_same quality at this_location
and was_somewhat disappointed
we_were_there just after opening on_a_sunday
there_was_only one other_table occupied
yet service_was_pretty poor
undoubtedly the_kitchen was_extremely slow
but the_server_was not_much better
as for_the_food
same great_flavor i_remember for the_most_part
the_chicken_vindaloo should_have been called potato vindaloo
however
very_little chicken_was to be_found
also
the_garlic on the_naan_was extremely bitter
as the_naan_was slightly charred
i assume the_garlic had slightly burned
the_price point on both_the naan_and_rice seemed_a_little high
i_believe it_was
for_the_naan and_a similar amount for a_small cup_of rice
charging for_rice seems overkill here
the entrees_are not_that cheap to begin with
it's the_old charging for chips salsa debate i_guess
overall
an average meal
but_i'm hoping it_was_an off day
will try_again sometime
this_place_is_a rare find_in the heart of scottsdale
if_you_love delicious_indian
great_service
lively ambiance
then you'll fall in_love_with td just as_i_have
my_favorite_dishes are_the chicken_tikka_marsala
lamb_vindaloo
paneer makhani
and their_garlic_naan
the_best_naan i've ever_tasted
if you enjoy super_spicy
make_sure_you request the_chef's spicy
you_may be_disappointed if_you_don't request extra_spicy
every friday and_saturday the exotic spicy cuisine_is paired with_its spicy
exotic belly_dancers
i_highly_recommend checking this hidden_gem out
i concur with_a_lot_of these reviewers
food_is_great and_reasonably_priced but_the_service does not invite you to_return
my_date and_i_were sat in a_tiny back room to_sit by ourselves
they should_have let us_know that was_the_only available table and_asked if_it_was okay
the_belly_dancer enjoyed dancing
but_it_was obvious she_didn't enjoy doing this in_front_of people
she has_the power to set_the tone of_your dining_experience
but_she hopped around without giving any eye contact and seemed_to rush by the_tables and_didn't step foot into_our room
when_ordering
the_server provided no help in making_a decision
his response was as_if everything_was mediocre
he_was not excited_about what_he was selling
next_time
i'll do take_out
i fell in_love_with indian_food after going to_this_place
i_go_there on_all my
special occasions
birthdays
holidays
last year i_even went_for valentines day
the_food there_is so unique good
i end_up getting different meals just so_i_can keep trying new_dishes
the_tandoori_chicken is my_favorite_dish
they_also have_this mango drink that is_amazing
i_have_to have_one every_time_i go
such_a yummy place_to_eat
gosh even writing this_review makes_me want_to_go again
it_doesn't get much better if you're looking_for_good food
great_food
avoid the booths they_are the_most uncomfortable seating i_have_ever experienced
loud as hell
they couldn't hear anything over the_phone so_i just_went in person and_that_was even worse
kids jumping off benches
everyone on staff seemed pissed off and stressed out
no host hostess so_if you_walk_in you_will stand there totally ignored forever unless_you grab someone in passing
this happened to_me_and everyone who walked_in the_whole time i_was_there
the menus had scribbles and dried food on_them
it's_all pretty pricey on_top_of_that but_at least the_food_was_good
not_worth putting up_with the_rest_of that bullshit though
guess i'll just_have to stick_with the frozen indian entrees_and naan from trader joe's
really great_naan
have only_had fish_and veg_dishes but never_had_a dish that_wasn't really_good
my_husband_and_i went_there_for lunch on_a_sunday
the_food_itself was_good but_the_service_was indifferent
many_indian_restaurants bring_out some complimentary papadams before even ordering
no such luck here
pretty much the_only_thing_that was free was_the water_and condiments
we_tried this out after having had_good luck at a_couple other_indian_restaurants in_the_area
we_will_be going_back_to those places and_not returning to_tandoori_times
this was_our_first_time going to_tandoori_times
the_atmosphere_was pleasant and_i_thought it_would_be more crowded than it_was
the_good
the_food
food_was_great
i_had_the goat_curry which_was their friday special
and it_was_wonderful
my_husband who doesn't like_most curry_dishes stuck with the_tandoori_chicken which_was wonderful as_well
a_side_of pesto naan rounded the_meal out
no_complaints about_the_food at_all
the_bad
the_service
our_waiter_was very_polite_and friendly the few_times we_saw him
he_brought us menus and_then left us waiting_for minutes_before coming_back_to take_our_order
he_then disappeared for_most our_meal
we had_to_ask another server_to track him down to_get_our bill
needless_to say our_drinks were_not refilled
we_also waited a very_long time for_our_food
the ugly
the_belly_dancing
actually it_wasn't the bellydancing
more specifically the dramatic rise in music and_the incessant finger chimes of_the dancer grew to_be irritating
the dancing was fun to_watch in the_beginning but became tiresome after first few minutes
it_was impossible to chat without shouting at my_husband
good_place
prices_were reasonable_and the_food_was_good
but_the_service needs some work
i_love indian_cuisine
so_much so
that_if i_see a_sign from_the roadway advertising indian_food
i'll veer across three lanes of traffic
driving as though i'm vin diesel's stunt double in those
fast_and furious
movies
all in_an unashamed effort_to sample their worldly delights
well
tandoori_times_is just_one of_those places
when_i'm in_the_mood for_indian
i_will typically run other drivers off the_road
push mothers with strollers out_of_the way
and knock the legs out_from under old folks
on_my way_to td
and_all for_one menu item
the bengun bhartha
this eggplant_dish is_so glorious
it's as though_it_was passed down from_the garden of eden's secret recipe book
which eve presumably stole right along_with that apple
all_the_other menu_items are good_if not_great
but_as i_say
the_eggplant is_one_of those dishes_that makes_me fantasize about_it while i'm eating my wife's homemade cooking
i_hate to_admit it
but td has made_me a_food philanderer
as far_as service
ambiance
and_everything else
who cares
when_you love something as_much_as_i love_their eggplant_dish
the_waiter could_have servers alzheimer's
my_table could_be in_the_middle_of_the parking_lot
and_that idiotic indian_music could_be blaring faux barry manilow
i simply don't_care
just give_me the_eggplant
some chai_tea
and_a guest who hates indian so_i_can snag all_the leftovers
i_eat my fair share of_indian_food_and i gotta say
this_is_probably one_of_the best
their masala has_a smokey flavor to_it that is_amazing
good_selection_of indian_beers and_a_nice happy_hour menu
customer service_was_excellent
we_will_definitely go_back
i'm from the_bay_area land of all_things good eats
so i'm_always leary about trying new places in_phoenix
i_tried_this spot_on my birthday because_i really_wanted indian_food
but specifically because the_website said they_had belly_dancing entertainment
drove all_the_way there to_find_out belly_dancing only happens friday and_saturday
bummer
ok so food
it_was hella spicy and_i_like spicy_food
but_my children couldn't eat_it
everyting was_one note of_spicy so_it_was hard_to enjoy the_good flavors
worse off is_you didn't_have much_to wash it down_with since there_are_no refills on drinks
but thank heavens for_the hot_chai table at least
to_top_it off i_think_the prices_are wayyy to high as_you have_to_order everything
rice_and_naan are_not included wih the_meals
every_other indian spot i've_been_to that_is standard
overall the_ambience was quaint but_i'm sad_to say i've_had better and didn't_have_to spend over_for tandoori_chicken
spinach paneer
samosas
and pesto naan
the_food_is_awesome
atmosphere_is nothing_special
but decent
this_was_my_first_time visiting tandoori_times
after seeing it advertised on groupon
i_thought i'd give_it_a try
my_friend_and_i decided_to_go for_lunch to_celebrate her birthday
it_was_very busy
which_was promising
the_waitress_was on her second day working_there and_was unfamiliar with the_menu
but_she was_friendly
the_house salad was_mediocre
the_entree
algoo gobi
was_delicious
but the_desserts were awful
the
mango
ice_cream was_a neon orange and_tasted nothing_like mango
or_any flavor_of ice_cream id ever_tasted actually
kinda vanilla
kinda puke
yuck
the_rice_pudding was not_worth eating either
the_worst part_of_the experience_was being followed out into the_parking_lot
after leaving the_groupon and cash tip
to_be told_that we_needed to_come speak with management about not ordering at least worth of_food
really
i_told the_waiter that_we_had spent just over
and_we obviously didn't expect any cash back_from the_groupon
he said his manager_was
fussy
and wouldn't like_it
i basically told him that_was too damn bad
and_that i_wasn't ordering more in_food
i_was actually kinda saving them
he finally figured out what_i_was saying and_left us alone
i_did end_up calling the_manager though
who_was not pleased_to hear about our_experience with_the dumb waiter
i_don't foresee returning there
i_took fellow yelpers' recs and_ordered naan_and bengun bhartha while my_bf ordered chicken_korma
it_was_all incredible
i've been apprehensive about_indian_food after a_couple bad experiences years_ago
but tandoori_times has changed my perspective degrees
i_cannot_wait to_go_back
plus
a majority_of the_customers tonight were south_asian indians so_you_know it's truly good indian_cuisine
best_indian_food there_is
i_get_the chili prawns every_time with the_potato naan_bread
if_you_like spicy
get chili prawns or chili_chicken
it's perfection
i crave their naan_bread daily
only_complaint_is_that the_service_is pretty slow
our_waiter was_very_nice_and friendly which_made up_for_the slow_service
the bellydancer
kinda awkward
some_people we_were with were into_it
but_it_was uncomfortable and_i basically wanted her to_leave our_table alone
haha
honestly
it's more_like_a stripper dancing in_front_of you as your trying to_have_a nice romantic dinner with_your boyfriend
what a_treat
p go_during the_week to_avoid the awkward dancer with abnormally loud music
but_the_food_is worth everything else and_i'm giving_this stars_for_the food only
we drive from gilbert to phoenix all_the_time for_this_place
the_drive is worth_it
have_been_there times_now
we_had two_of the smaller happy_hour apps to_start
samosa_and the_shrimp
both_were great
happy drink deals were_good
had_the vodka lassi
good_and inexpensive
for_dinner we_had_the tikka_masala lamb_and coconut_chicken
tried a_variety_of their_naan
all_were fresh_and_delicious
favorite is_still the plain_naan but_you can't_go_wrong_with any of_them
service_was_excellent
really made_us_feel like they_were grateful that we_were_there
recommendation
go durning happy_hour and start_off with_a_couple apps and_drinks
being indian_cuisine
most_of_the_dishes have_a fantastic spicy flavor
unfortunately my_wife doesn't share this same sense_of taste
you_can request that_they keep the_spice to_a minimum if_you_can't handle it
they_served us stale rice
average main_dishes
not_as flavorful
not_enough meat_in the lamb_dishes
overpriced
i_left my iphone here_and one_of_the guys there stole it literally
i_went_there to collect and_they denied it
i sat there from noon till pm till that person_who served my_table arrived_and after too_much struggle he accepted and gave_me my_phone
he_was lucky i_did_not hand him to_the cops
never ever_go there_again
totally untrusted staff
my_first_experience with tandoori_times amounted to_a combination_of poor_service
but excellent_food
went_to check_this out_with_a groupon
food_was_fantastic
service excellent
i_would_go_back for_sure
a_pleasant surprise
i like_this_place
i_wouldn't say it's_the_best indian_food_i've_ever_had
but_it's close_by and_very convenient for_me to_get_to and_has some_good options
i_really_enjoy their wraps
an easy and_quick eat that's also_delicious
i_really_like their_naan choices too
lots_of different flavors
very_tasty
i_like_to get their_tandoori_chicken
pretty_good not the_best_i've_ever_had
but_still
if_i want tandoori_chicken
i_don't_have too far to_go
definitely a_good location
prices_are okay in my_experience indian_restaurants always seem kinda pricey
and_the charging extra_for rice_is normal
though i_don't_care for_it
i_mean really
who isn't gonna need rice_with their paneer
i_think_the one complaint i_have is_the_service
it_doesn't matter when_i_go there or how crowded it_is or isn't the_service_is_always slower then i'd_like
and_it's_a different waiter everytime so_i_don't get_that
still
worth_going to on_the ocassion i_am craving_indian_food
amy
our_server_was very_attentive_and pleasant
she_was wearing this pretty blouse and_i_asked about_it
and_she told_me the owner's mother sells them_on fridays
def going_to check that out next_time
i_really hope they_have itty bitty sizes for_me
food
nan was_overcooked
the_bottom side was burnt
chicken_tikka_masala
seasoning
texture
and consistency of_the_dish was_excellent
chicken was_just_a tad try but_overall
great_flavor
would_be more awesome if_they sliced up the_chicken into smaller cubes to_give flavor consistency
recommended esp for ppl who don't_like spicy
its very
umami
i_enjoy the_creamy touch this_place gives to_it
shich distinguishes this_place from other_places
seasoned rice
came out warm
cooked just_right
samosas choley
non spicy dish
i_eat it_with the_red sauce
spicy
to_add a lili kick
the exterior was fried crispy just_right
and_the mashed potato inside were soft_and warm
beans were_very well_seasoned and_cooked
could tell they_put time into_it
methi chicken
i_tried_this dish for_the_first_time and_i_must admit i_like_it quite_a_bit
ordered spicy
have water prepared
amy was diligent w h
i_wish_i_could go_to_this_place every_day if_i_could afford to
dropping down_to three stars
on a_recent visit
i_saw two roaches on the_main floor of_the_restaurant
no_one seemed_to care
so_i got_up and stepped on_one
i pointed out the_other
and_one_of the_staff killed it
but they_didn't seem surprised
i_know that roaches are hard_to control
but having two_of them wandering about in_a busy restaurant just isn't a_good_thing
also
our_waiter_was an overly chatty guy_who seems_to think we_are interested in_his voice
they_had some_good staff in_the_past
but_i suspect the_owner
who likes to_get drunk and hang out_on_the patio
gives me_the impression of_a guy_who would_be difficult_to work for
the_food_is still decent_and better_than anything else i've_found
but_i'm looking_for alternatives
the food_was_ok for_a top dollar pricing
service_was fine for adults with babies
two month old toddlers did_not eat or drink_and no plates was_served
each of_us_had one drink w people having refills
fairly simple service
we_were slapped with_an automatic gratuity charge as we_had people_in our_party
babies no mess
beware
we_are confused
the_waiter said its the_number_of heads and_not who eats matters
advice to_stay away from_this expensive place_that rips off customers
we_went_here for_dinner a_couple_of days back for_a celebration
we_first chose to_sit at_a booth
those seats were incredibly uncomfortable
the_back rests are_too thick which_makes the seat really small
so_we moved_to a_table
we started_with an_appetizer aloo_tikki
which_was_good
but the_chutneys could_have been_more flavorful
we_had baingan bharta
eggplant
which_was pretty much burnt and panneer tikka_masala which_was normal
the breads were_good
but the_aloo naan_was too thick in_my_opinion
and the_veg briyani was_pretty ok ish
the lassis were not_bad
while_we_were waiting for_our_food
there_was_a big party with_a kid who_was just let loose and_was running from_one table_to another
before we_could realize what_was happening
he_just threw up next_to us
his parents were least bothered and_just wiped him up
continued eating and_the kid got back_to running
we_were disgusted to_say_the least and_the_waiter moved us_to another table
but_even after_they cleaned up_the mess
we_could smell vomit throughout_the time_we_were_there
they_should have_used a_strong disinfectant
i_strongly suspect they_used only water to clean it
so anyway
we lost our appetite
ate very_little
skipped dessert and_took the_rest_of_the food home
with mediocore food_and bad ambience
our_experience wasn't all_that good
one star_for_the service
one star_for_the panneer dish
i_have_to_say that_this_is the_best_and cleanest indian_food_i_have_ever_had
from the_moment we_walked_in we_loved the smells that greeted us_and along_with_the very friendly_service i_was sold
my_husband_ordered the_coconut chicken_curry_and i the_paneer makani and three garlic tandoori breads
i_could_have just eaten the_bread
super yum
everything_was as we_ordered_it and food_was stove hot
i_love_this_place and will_go there_again and_again
to_all_the haters out_there
this_is good_food
come_on
the_atmosphere here was_great
very laid back and_relaxing
the live belly_dancer was a_nice_touch
the_food_and_service in the_other_hand was_not so_great
i_got_the_chicken biryani
number
and wren brought_the food_out was_impressed_with the_portion until i_found only small pieces_of_chicken in_the mix the_rest was veggies_and rice
the_service_was either to overboard or none existent
asked_for_a drink_and minutes later got my_drink but when_ordering the_waiter asked_me times what_i wanted when i_told_him i_needed some_time
overall atmosphere_is a_star food_and_service star
when_they drink dey rum
dey only want roti
aloo with channa
mix up_with_some curry
wish_they would play more chutney on_the radio
anyway
back_to_the review
this_is_the closest thing arizona has_to a_good guyanese
or trini
curry
since there_isn't guyanese roti shop
that_i'm aware_of
in_az i_make do_with tandoori
the_atmosphere_is cozy and inviting
the_staff always friendly and_accommodating
the_only_thing i'm not_a_fan_of is the_belly_dancing when_i'm eating
makes me_feel like i'm in_a_strip club when they're people sticking money in_the dancer's sari
i_love the_fact_that there_are always indians eating_here
that's a_good_sign
you_wait a_little longer for your_food but_that means it's fresh
it's_not fast_food so if_you_can't handle the_wait
go_to mc donalds
this_is_not_a food factory
i_always_get_the tikki_masala with the_aloo naan
it's_good and_it faintly satisfies my cravings for curry_with roti or dahl pouri
tandoori's version_of roti is_some chip thing not_a west indian roti
so_if you're looking_for that get the_naan
the_only_thing missing was_some rum haha
the_portions_are very_generous so_if you're on_a diet
be_prepared_to slip up
prices_are great
i_believe a dinner_for with_no alcohol
is around
very_affordable for fresh cooked food
yes please
nice interior
casual yet elegant
well_priced menu_with many_options
food_is_delicious
really wonderful naan
fyi bread
tandori_chicken is_great available in_all white_meat
vindaloo chicken almost the_best cesars had
make sure use the_green chutney
if indian_cuisine_is new_to you the_staff_was also r eally good_with menu suggestions and serving size
live bug in sauce
i_saw a bug crawling in green sauce_which i already put_it in_my food
when_i reported it_to waiter there she just disappeared with the_sauce
no_one came_to my_table for_minutes and_i_had to_call waiter_to replace my_food with bug infected food_after minutes
worst experience ever
i_have_to start_with the_garlic_nan
my_favorite part_of indian_cuisine_is the_nan
we oredered orders_of garlic_nan and_it_was burnt
not just_a_little over cooked
the_whole bottom of_each piece was black charred burnt
completly ruined the_meal
the tiki_masala and vindaloo were_both good_but for_the_price
i_can_get just_as_good and bigger portions just_about everywhere else
the_prices_were really over the_top
you_pay_for rice_and nan as_well regardless of_what you_order
i_did_not feel like i_had_a meal by_any_means and_that is_what dishes
one
small plate
nan
rice
and_one drink cost us
we_were_both just full but_had i been with_a guy or my step father
we_would_have needed more_food for
the_atmosphere_is great
the_place_looks really clean
the_nan_was so bad though that_it ruined the_meal_and even_if it_was_perfect
i_still would_have only given it three stars_because the_prices_are just way more_than everywhere else
i_had more reasonable meals at the_best indian_cuisine restaurants_in san_francisco
our_server_was good
however
after_our
small plate
she seemed_a_little put_off that we_wanted clean plates for our_meals
she did bring them_and was_nice about_it but_we shouldn't have had_to_ask
with_all_the sauces on_the meals
mixing them would not_have_been good_and our_plates were clearly very dirty after the_appetizer
won't be_back
just_not worth_the_price
i'm_in here_for_lunch every month or_so
and i'm_always impressed
fantastic_food at very decent prices
it's_a_great spot to_hit if you're craving_some indian_food
but_don't necessarily want_to_go the_buffet route
they've usually got_a good crowd
but the_service_has always_been top_notch
no matter how_busy
poor
poor management
i had_a_groupon voucher for_this_restaurant
and i_tried to_use_it today with_a_friend as_my guest
we_arrived and_i_asked right away what_the process was_for redeeming the_groupon
did they want the voucher now or when the_check arrives
the_nice server said
now is_ok
and_i opened the_app on_my iphone and_she wrote down the_number
she handed my_phone back to_me
and_i showed her that_i_was going_to press the redeemed button
no problem
my_friend_and_i ordered drinks
a_mango_lassi and_a diet coke
the_server brought the_drinks
and my_friend_and_i continued to_make small talk and look over the_menu
suddenly
the_server and_a manager were back at_the_table
there's_a problem_with the_groupon
when_we try_to enter the_number
it says it's_been redeemed
no kidding
i_just redeemed it in_front_of_the server
the_server then apologized because_it_was her first day
and the_manager kept saying
i'm sorry
i_can't apply the_groupon without the_groupon being active
then_he went_on to_say_that i_should call groupon_and have them reactivate this and_not to_worry because this_has happened before
um
is groupon going_to take_care of_this right_now
i_don't_think so
i_just wanted_to ask at_this_point
and_this_is your customer's fault because
so_there i_had pressed the redeemed button in good faith in_front_of_the server so that_she wouldn't get_in trouble
i've_had people thank me at_other_places because_they forgot_to ask me to_do this
so_i just do_it now in_front_of them
ease of anxiety cuz who needs that
right
and_i'm now being told by the_manager that we'll have_to_pay cash because_he has_no recourse with regard to processing the promotion
good management would_have apologized for_their establishment's mistake and_then filed a claim with groupon themselves
but not_here
and_the very least he_could have_done was comp'd our_drinks
i_think_that tab was_about
any attempt at concession might_have led me_to just stay
order_a meal_and work it_out later
but_i_was furious at_this_point
work it_out
bud
it's what_you_get paid_for
did_i_mention that_our booth was_one_of two occupied when we_were_seated before this fiasco
management here needs_to
buy a vowel
before_i would even consider coming back_to_this_place
good customer_service can_make all the_difference when dealing with_the general public
this establishment has
obviously
yet_to learn that
worst service in_town
bought certificate at restaurant
com and_was told_that we_couldn't use_it since they_don't honor the certificate anymore
i_have_to get_my back from_them
haven't tried_their food_and i_will_not come_here again
went_here the_other_night for_dinner
i_was worried
because i_am_a picky eater and_have_never had_indian_food_before
i_had_the tandoori_chicken and_a_naan
which is_kind_of like_a pita
and_both_were really_good
on_top_of_that
while we_were_eating all_of_the sudden
the_music got kind of loud and_we_were a_bit confused
as_it turns out
they_have_a belly_dancer that dances there while you're eating
our_server_was also very_nice
the_belly_dancing makes_it a_fun atmosphere
and the_food_was_awesome
have_been frequenting tt as long_as they've been in_the_valley
was_always happy_with service_and_food
but_now i_see service going down_the tube
had_to_wait min for drinks order
looks like_they prejudice their own
bring_out water with_no ice without asking
p some of_us drink with ice
our_server just wanted_to rush through
very_bad i_do know they_have good servers
but inconsistency doesn't help
one bad_experience is_all it_takes for_not coming back
if kids have to_eat whatever is on_the_menu_is not good_enough in_my_book
was highly_recommended this_restaurant by client
the_service_was_a total miss
the food_was_okay to mediocre
way_too expensive_for what_it_is
been_to_india several_times for business_and never seen belly_dancing in_india
i_asked several client friends that_are indian if belly_dancing is_a tradition
not_one said yes
the_belly_dancing was_a_bit annoying and_felt slightly uncomfortable with_my guests
the dancer was annoyed that no_one at my_table appreciated it_did_not tip
she just started_to fling her hips closer
i_would_have flung my_naan at her to_get_the hell away from us
i'm surprised_by_the low ratings that tandoori_times has received
we really_enjoy coming_here
and_will often come_for family dinners when people come into town
we really_enjoy the_belly_dancing
the women are talented
balancing candles
swords
etc
it's something different_and it's_always fun when someone at our_table gets up_and dances too
we_also enjoy_the hookah lounge on the_patio
the_patio is a_really_nice private spot
they_have tons_of different flavors and_the_staff_is always helpful_and attentive
the_free_chai is_also quite delicious
i_love_the house salad
the dressing is really_delicious
it_is_a yogurt based dressing with very_delicious spices
i_really could eat_it with_a spoon
but_i keep_it classy and refrain
i_also order_the vegetable_biryani it's perfectly seasoned_and absolutely_amazing
it_is delicate
a_little_spicy and_really shows perfect restraint
we_love getting the_naan
my favorites_are
garlic
mmmm so well_seasoned
onion
aloo
stuffed_with potato
chii naan_with cilantro and and_green chili
just the_right amont of kick
and
my_husband loves_the keema naan
minced lamb
dishes_that are notable
so says my_family
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_saag
tandoori fish
my discerning father in law called it one_of_the best dishes he's ever_had
many at_the_table agreed
also
i forget which but a_few_of the_lamb dishes_are a hit
sorry not_that helpful
tandoori_times isn't a_cheap indian_joint
but we_don't mind paying_for the_quality_of_food and the_experience
we_actually had_a_very different experience than we_have_had in_the_past last_night
we_ordered different_types_of naan
and they_forgot the_garlic and_gave us aloo instead
they_made it_right
by bringing the_garlic
but it_took_a while
i_ordered_the house salad and_it_wasn't as fresh as_it typically is
i_also_ordered the vegetable_biryani rice_with no peas
when it_came
there_were peas
i_told the_waiter and_he apologized
and_said we should keep that_one and_they would_make another one
then_he came_back a_few seconds later and_said
actually i_need_to take that_one
i_was obviously very concerned at_this_point that_they_were going_to pick out the_peas from_my dish
the_dish came_back a_few_minutes later
luke warm
with_a rogue pea or_two
this_was very uncharacteristic of_our times at_tandoori_times
and_i'm hoping it_was_just an_off night
we_will_be_back again
and_i_have my fingers crossed that it_will_be a_better experience
back up_to stars_because the_food_here_is consistently good and_their daily specials_are really excellent
the tuesday lamb_dish is exceptional
and the_goat_curry on_friday is_amazing
i'm not_a_big_fan personally of the_belly_dancing
and_their pappadum's have gotten worse just plain now
and seemingly pre cooked days in_advance
but the_food_is_great
and_still better_than anything else i can_find in_phoenix metro
most authentic_indian_food outside of_india
i_know
because i've been
don't_let_the idea_of exotic food scare you away
there's something_for everyone here
even vegetarians_and children
try the_paneer
pressed cheese
dishes or samosas choley if_you_don't_like meat
try_the_chicken or paneer makhani if_you_don't_like the_heat
for medium_spicy dishes
the_chicken_tikka_masala_is excellent with_a_side_of rice_and_naan bread
if_you_want_a bite of_something that'll bite you back_with a_really great_flavor
try the_tandoor fish wrap
the key to_eating reasonably is to_go as a_group_of or_more
get rice_and_naan and_a_couple different_items to_share with the_entire table
you_don't_have to_drink alcohol
but_there's a_full service bar at all_of_the tandoori_times locations and_the beer_selection is above_average
this_is_the original location_and offers_a great
semi upscale atmosphere and_a_nice patio complete with hookah
bellydancers join the fun on_friday and_saturday nights
decent value if you crave very_good quality_food
an exotic atmosphere_and an_authentic_indian experience
ok
the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic
but it's_definitely exciting
one_of_my_favorite weekend hangouts
solid out_of
the_lunch_specials here_are great
especially_the vegetarian_menu on fridays
the_lunch wrap is_always_a favorite
the_salad that comes_with the_vegetarian lunch_menu isn't_that great
but the_rice_is ok
the_meals are quick_and spicy and_the_service_is very_good
not an_expert_on_indian food
my_daughter took_me
and_much to_my_surprise
i_loved_it
a
wonderful indian_food
the_best food_and_service
give_it_a try_and you_will_not_be_disappointed

best_indian_food_in phoenix scottsdale
great_food

but_i've had_better elsewhere

hubby and_i_decided_to
eat outside_the box
for_our latest date_night
this_is_definitely a_good_place_to go if you typically don't_have_a very adventurous palate
the_music was_a_tad loud and_our_server was_on_the slow side
but_otherwise we_had_a_great experience trying some new_dishes
i_had_the_lamb curry and_it_was_very_good
hubby had_the saturday special
some_kind_of beef
can't remember the_name
and_it_was_very_good and_just a_little_spicy
the_garlic_naan_and basmati_rice were to_die_for
their_website states they_are_open on_weekends pretty much all_day
so my_husband called to_get us a_reservation because for_some absurd reason you_need a_reservation to_use their groupon
they_didn't answer so_he thought they_were_busy and called back
eventually someone picked up and_made him a_reservation
we showed up_on time_and the_first_thing out_of_the waitstaff's mouth was
so are_you the guy_who called times
um i_don't_think it_was times_but yeah sure
guilty
the_thing was_that_the asshole was relentless
embarrassing us in_front_of_the other customers
we_tried to_explain that the_website and_the voice mail gave us incorrect information but the_guy paolo still ended up blaming us by saying
you should_have left_a voice mail
and
everyone_was sleeping and_finally someone woke up_to answer roe you
he_didn't even apologize and_definitely made_us_feel like_we were_at fault
if he_would have_taken ownership of_the issue it would_have_been a_lot different
i_could take the_first snide comment and_let it roll
but_he wouldn't come off it nor apologize
then we_thought hey if_they_are mad that_we woke the cooks up then maybe they'll mess with our_food or_something
we_felt so embarrassed and ridiculed and everyone_was staring at_us so_we just left
i_work hard for_my money
i'm not_going_to spend it_on assholes when there_are_so many_other delicious restaurants to_choose_from
this_place is_hard_to find and i_used_to forget it even existed
we_finally made_it there mid week
the_menu_is huge
so_many traditional_indian dishes our favorites like chicken_makhani and_garlic_naan plus many others
our_waiter was_very_friendly_and had_some good drink recommendations off_the cocktail list
it_was happy_hour pricing at_the_time
the alcoholic mango_lassi_was delectable
there aren't many_indian eateries in_scottsdale
but_this_is probably_the_best
out_of_the other that i_know of
not_a fancy place
dress casual
or buy an indian_style blouse in the_front of_the_restaurant
i_tried_to use google translate to_find_out how to_say
holy crap that_was expensive
in some_indian language but didn't_have_the option
i_came_here_with a client yesterday for_lunch
it_was_my second time a tandoori_times
although this_location was a_new one
its actually kind of tough to_find
tucked_away in_a pretty large complex of businesses and restaurants
we_sat_down and were_greeted by a_very_nice waiter
we_both ordered_an indian_beer and_asked_for suggestions
he pointed a_few out_and we_got_to ordering
appetizer was_a lamb kabob
but_they take_out the stick before it_is served
just ground lamb with_some saut ed onions_and peppers
it_was accompanied by a_few sauces
it_was_ok but certainly nothing earth shattering
then we_ordered two entrees he recommended
one was_a shrimp_dish with_a reddish curry
the_other was chicken_vindaloo
pretty much chicken with_potatoes in_a yellowish curry
he_also suggested we get_some nan
a flat_bread
and some_rice
advising the_dishes_were family_style
hope i_don't sound to crabby
but the_portions_were crap
i_was_expecting it_to_be like_a chinese restaurant where_you get_a_good portion to_share
nope
the shrimp_dish had_a whopping shrimp
for bucks i_expected much_more than_that
especially after teh family_style sharing comment
if_i go_to_a chinese place and_get spicy shrimp they_bring out_a proper portion
same with_the_chicken
maybe or chunks_of_chicken with_a_little potatoes
same story as above
anywhere else and_i'd get_a mountain of_chicken
enough to_share
right
the little_bit_of lamb_was
plus they_also charged for the_nan and_rice
bucks each
anyway
the_food_was definitely good
but_when accompanied by_a bill
plus tip
this was_probably_the smallest meal i've_had
both my client and_i_could have_eaten much_more if allowed
so_i_guess to sum it_up
good_food but_not at its price point
those things have_to line up to_get_a glowing review from_this yelper
highly_recommend_it though if price isn't a_big concern
can't_wait_to have to_explain to_my boss why i'm expensing an lunch for_just me and_one client at_an_indian joint
i_figured i_would write an update on this_review since the_waiter reached out_and attempted to rebut the points in my_review
unfortunately all it_did was change their review from stars to_one
the waiter's comments are below
waiter response to_my original review
hi
i_waited to respond so_i_could look_at your check for_this day
first_i apologize for_your experience lamb seekh kabob is_served without skewers because_they_are metal ones and ' long
we_have daily lunch_specials which run from
to
its complete lunch_and comes_with everything
lunch_specials combo of two_dishes is_only
additional
we cannot compare indian_restaurant with chinese restaurant
tips were voluntary
we_will surely look into_our prices compared_to_other_indian restaurants
thanks
my response to this_is
i followed your lead when_ordering our_meal from beginning to_end
i trusted you
if you_had options that could_have significantly reduced our bill
why was_there absolutely no mention of_this during_my minute lunch
i originally thought the_service_and food_was_good
but meal_was overpriced compared_to what we_received
instead
apparently the_service_was not_good
you seem_to_have let me pay_for each meal plus an_additional for_rice and_for nan when we_could_have gotten much_more for_a lesser price
and likely left very_satisfied
we trusted you_to guide us_to good_food
not_just good_food that_would pad the_bill at a_la_carte prices
in_the_future
you_may want_to guide your customers to_your specials
eaten_here twice this week delicious_indian_food
my fianc and_i_are visiting from iowa and honestly cannot get_enough of_this_place
their staff
bobbi and joel
were_really kind and_helpful
they_know the_menu in_and_out and joel had great_suggestions
i_had_the chicken_korma_and it_was_perfect
recommend getting an order_of_naan plain_and pesto were_really_good
also_a must_have is_their delicious basmati_rice
oh
and don't_forget_to get a_mango_lassi they're really_tasty
another great thing_is that_their happy_hour is_from and_they_have a_great_selection_of well_priced drinks
it's_pretty challenging to_find_this location it's on_the north west corner_of via ventura and hayden road
google maps has it wrong
persevere it's_worth_it
this_is_my_favorite_indian food in_az
super high_quality
fresh_ingredients and_the_best flavor in_town
favorite_dishes include shrimp or veggie_korma
tandoori anything
and a_variety_of delicious paneers
and_the_naan is_incredible garlic is_my_favorite
but_i've tried plain
potato_and onion
and_they're all wow
the_atmosphere_is_nice sit down restaurant
although_the seating could be_a_little comfier
the_service_is_always friendly_and_the patio is_lovely
the indoor seating isn't super comfortable
but_definitely good_enough
seriously delicious_food
the_food_is simply superb always tasty
i_often have sag paneer and_it_is really_good
the_naan_is great
too
this_is_a very good_place_to go_with_a vegetarian because_there are_many
many_options
when_the weather is_good
it's lovely to_sit on the_patio
we_sat there a_few_weeks_ago and_while the_service_was_pretty slow
the_entire experience was_good
it_was saturday_night and they_were_busy
the vindaroo and_naan_were exceptional
good portions
it appears they_need more servers as it_seemed chaotic
or_maybe a bartender
i'm
typing
this
to
demonstrate
the
service
speed
very
slow
seriously
minutes_for dinner to_arrive and after_dinner coffee
it_was chai_tea
took twenty minutes
there were_only six of_us
went_there to_meet friends_for dinner
food_was_okay
i_won't_be back
although the_food_is_great
the_service_is just_too slow
we stepped inside_the door_and about five employees saw us_and not_one acknowledged us
i_am_not coming_back_here
had_dinner there tonight
the_food_was fine
not particularly distinguished but not_bad either
unfortunately
the_service_was brutally slow
it_really should_not take an_hour for_food
meal_was over two hours
no desert
sorry but wouldn't go_back to_find_out if_this was_an aberration
the_other_reviews suggest its_not
great_service
i'm_a_fan of the_belly_dancing on_weekends which can_be fun when on the_patio with enjoyable weather
i_also recommend_the prawn vindaloo if_you_want spice
the_service_here was deplorable
i_heard several complaints of the_lack_of service
and_i experienced it firsthand
it_took minutes_to_get a_menu
and_another to_get_the coke i_ordered
how do_you forget rice_with an_entree at_an_indian_restaurant
i_hope the_food_is_excellent
but_i doubt it
the_worst chicken_vindaloo i_have_ever experienced on three continents
i_would_not go_back to_this_restaurant
i complained to_what appeared to_be_the owner
who stated the_chef would_come and_see me
i_am still waiting
i_feel_like i'm missing something when_i don't_come_here at_least_once_a_week
love_this_place
i_can't get_enough especially since my_friends_and_i discovered they_have_a special happy_hour menu
at_this_point
we don't_even need to_look_at the_menu
i_love the_chilli naan
chilli paneer
tandoori fish
and samosa
you_might be thinking whoa
hold on tiger
that's a_whole lotta food
yes
it_is
i always_have leftovers from_this_place for the_next_day
yum
first_time_here
will_be_back_for sure
had_the_lamb_vindaloo
chicken_tiki
naan sampler and_some kingfishers
all amazing
paulo our_waiter_was awesome
very_attentive_and took time to_explain everything thoroughly to_us ignant white folks
give paulo a raise
service_was bad
come if_you're_not in_any rush
i'm talking over an_hour before you_get_a drink
they_also forgot_to bring_out if appetizers which we_were glad of in_the_end because_it may_have added another hour onto_the wait
the_belly_dancer gimmick is annoying but i_am_a joyless swine so it_might_be your thing
i_don't_like being worked for tips for_something i_didn't ask_for though and_i'm pretty_sure belly_dancing is not_an_indian tradition anyway
food
i_ordered_a chicken_vindaloo
which_is supposed_to be spicy_but was_pretty mild it was_really_tasty though so no_complaints
the missus got_a chicken_tikka_masala which she enjoyed too
naan was_decent
they_also serve kingfisher which_is_a fine beer
best tasting indian i've_had_in phoenix so_far
i_have_to write that i_was_disappointed
the_problem may_have been the_waiter but our appetizers didn't_come until minutes later when we_had_to remind him that_it hadn't arrived
he forgot
he forgot the channa_masala and_we_were too far into our_meal to_ask_for it_again
he_didn't ask_us how hot we_wanted our_food so it_all came out bland without much spice
if you look_at my ratings for_indian_cuisine
i pretty much love all_of_it
by_far_the best i_have_found in_the_phoenix_area is the_dhaba in_tempe
here the_food_was fine but given_the alternatives
i_wouldn't go_back
the_veggies were_too mashed together and_the_chicken_tikka_masala sauce_was too thick_and goopy
the_lamb_biryani was_good_but since_they made_it so mild
i_didn't enjoy_it as_much_as_i could_have
the_atmosphere_is cute and_more upscale than_most indian_restaurants_and the mall area_is attractive and upscale as_well
came_here to_meet a_friend for_lunch_and i_was_very disappointed
we_ordered biryani rice
not_bad but not_great either
coconut_chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
and_garlic_naan
after waiting min we_got_our food
the_chicken dishes_were lukewarm at_best and_there_was no_flavor difference between_the dishes
i_had asked_for my masala to_be spicy but_there_was no_spice whatsoever
the_garlic_naan had so_much garlic on_it that_it_was like biting straight into raw garlic
we_waited another min to_get_our check since our_server_was nowhere to be_found
i_finally had to_go_to_the bar to_get_the check
do_not come_here if_you_want authentic indian_cuisine
value_for_money and its_not expensive
with top rate quality_food their_lunch time menu sets the_standard for_the_rest to follow go_on try_it
satisfied
tonight's dinner was_one_of_the_best meals i_have_ever_had
the chicken_tikki_masala was_superb and the_naan_bread_was the_perfect accompaniment
we_had_a wonderful belly_dancer with_a fantastic body and personality to match
the_food_is_good
but_the_service ruins it
hence the star
i_made dinner reservations for_people for pm on_friday
april th
we_had_a movie show to catch at
pm
but_i figured
hour for_dinner should be enough time
boy
was_i wrong
we_arrived_at pm_and of_us_were seated in_a booth for_four people
go figure
after minutes
we pulled a chair for_the fifth person
not_a_big deal
but you_expect better when_you make dinner reservations before hand
anyhow
it_took_a good minutes_for_our server_to greet us
by this_time
we_had our entire order ready_to be placed
at
we place the_order
our_drinks were served_at
pm
it_was_just kingfisher
so_i_guess we_got lucky there
it's pm now
minutes since we_placed our_order
and_our food_is nowhere to_be seen
we try to_get_a hold of_our very_busy
slightly rude or_maybe he_just had_a_very dry sense_of humor that none_of_the five people_in my_party really understood
we_told the_server that we_had_a movie to catch at
and_were hoping to_get_the food asap now
the_server tells us_that our_food is_almost here
with_no sign_of regret
minutes later
it's now
pm
our_food is_still not_here
my_friend_and_i go over_to the_counter and_ask our_server
who_is now the_bartender
and_he tells us_that we_are second in_line
second in_line minutes_from placing the_order
you_got to_be kidding me
anyhow
very politely we_requested him_to cancel our_order
since_we really didn't wanna miss our movie
then our_server disappears
we_get hold of another employee outside the_kitchen
requesting to cancel our_order
at_this_point
we_just wanted to_pay_for our_drinks and_get out_of there
the_second employee then goes in_and minutes later
our_server comes out_of_the kitchen with our_food
it's now
pm
exactly minutes_from placing the_order
and minutes_from being_seated
we literally swallow our_food and_got out_of there_at
pm
of_course
we_were late for_the movie
and got_the rd row from the_front
to sum up
a
i_made dinner reservations
b
got seated in_an undersized booth for_people
c
waited_for minutes_for_our food
d
ate our_food
which should have_been_a pleasant experience
in less than minutes
e
got late for_the movie
definitely_one_of_the worst restaurant experiences
never again
came_here while_we_were in_town visiting family this past saturday_night
and i_would_say without even reading other reviews_on_yelp
i immediately thought wow
do they_even know we_are out_here
we_had requested outdoor seating
and they_put a_table together really quick for_us
however
no_one came to_give us menus until we_had_to run back inside to remind them we_were here
the_waitress was_very_nice_and helpful
she asked_how we_liked our_food prepared_and suggested appropriate spice_levels
however
getting our wine
appetizers
food and_even the_check was_a_very long process
i_don't_know_if it_has to_do_with kitchen organization or_just a lack_of needed staff
but do_not come_here if_you_are on_a schedule
the_food_is_great no_complaints there
it_wasn't the_best_indian_food_i've_ever had
but it_really got_the job done
we_asked_for chef hot_and it actually came out spicy
we_did enjoy_it
i_recommend_the tandoori_chicken
lamb_tikka_masala
lamb_biryani and_naan
in sum
good_food
slow_service
a_good_place_to go if_you're_not in_a rush to_get anywhere after
also
do_not come_here when_you're on_the brink of starvation
because by_the_time you_get your_food you_might be on_the_floor
definitely_go on_a_friday or saturday when the_belly_dancer is here
she is_great_and really invokes the_crowd and kids
i_liked_the coconut_chicken the_best
the_spicy wasn't_that spicy so next_time_i_will try_indian hot
our_server
joe was_amazing_and knew the_menu very_well
the_best_part was the_happy_hour
you_can_get_a glass_of_wine for_only
one_of_the_best_indian places_i've_been to i'm a_while
authentic
tasty_food
it_is_a_bit expensive
but you_get a_good_amount_of good for_your money
which_makes the_cost more bearable
i frequently order take_out and_they_are quick_and rarely make mistakes
i_do wish though that they_would remind you to_order rice separately i_always forget
what_a pathetic food
we_went_here to_celebrate birthday
ordered biriyani
which_is so tasteless not_even worth of touching it
there chilli_chicken is_one_of_the worst i_ever_had in_my_life
we_were_there before
but looks like it's_a rapidly going down
i_should say_this_is the_worst food ever_tasted in_a_while
watch out if_you_want_to venture out into this_place
we went_for_lunch yesterday and_wanted_to use a_groupon
but_we_had the_dinner one instead
we_both ordered_from their lunch_menu and_got wraps
i_got_the aloo_tikki
potatoes
which also_had lettuce
onions
mint_chutney and tamarind_sauce
the_menu didn't say_this
but_it also_has mayonnaise in_it
it_wasn't horrible
but_i would've preferred not_having it
overall_it was_great_and their_naan is_really_good
i_look_forward_to trying more items for_dinner
like_their biryani_and samosas
tandoori_times doesn't have_a_buffet
and_i actually thought they_had_a buffet based_on_the groupon description
but they_have killer lunch_specials
they_have different appetizers
entrees
and_desserts everyday on_a lowly discounted price_of per dish
we_were_able_to order all_our main_courses off_of this menu_and went_on our_way with a_great_lunch
the_restaurant_has great decorations and colorful ambiance as_well
i'm shocked i_haven't reviewed these_guys before
this_is my_go_to place_for_indian_food
really_delicious
pros very_good_food
i_was_a newbie to_indian_food when_i first came_here
years_and years_ago
and_now i_feel super confident in_my ability_to order_it
you_can request what level_of spiciness you'd like
scale_of to
which_is_nice if_you're_a wuss like i_am
they_have bellydancers on_the_weekends
don't make eyecontact or they_will ask you_to dance with_them lol
the_servers_are usually very_attentive
fill up soda's quickly
can answer questions
you_know
the_usual
cons i_guess my biggest gripe would_be that_they_are forever offering a_groupon
the_worst part
when i_came_here last i_was with_my aunt and_she used a_groupon
nooooo
i_hate hate hate groupon_and groupon users
sorry aunt kris
you_are of_course exempt because_you at least tip on_the full amount
i say_this with love tandoori_times as i_have_been loyal to_you since high school
no_more groupon
honestly it ruins the_experience for_us loyal full paying customers because suddenly the_restaurant_is packed_with these deal chasing vultures
we_went_to tandoori_times last_night as_it_was the_only_place we fancied that_was open
only_other tables_were taken and_our service_was_great
really_friendly server
food_was_pretty_good
i_had_the mattar_paneer and hubby had the_chicken_vindaloo 'chef hot'
also_tried_the chili naan
all very_good
not_the_best we've ever_had
but very_good
place could_do with_a good clean
the_area under our_table hadn't seen a broom or mop in_a_while
but_all in_all
we_liked it_and would_go_back
i_have_had quite_a_bit of_indian_food in_my_life and_this has_been by_far_the best
four_of us stuffed ourselves into_a food_coma
the_ingredients were_all fresh
the_lunch_specials such a_great_deal
the_flavors_were out_of_this_world
i_want_to go_back soon
i_am getting hungry thinking_about_it
great_service also by the_way
they_were attentive
friendly
and_quick
this_place just_opened last saturday and is_one_of_the first restaurants_in centennial center north of ann
west of_the
my_husband_and_i went_there tonight and really_enjoyed_it
i_think_we enjoyed not_having to_drive all_the_way to paradise to_find indian_food
the_dishes_were a_touch expensive_for the_area
but the_quality_and location made_up_for paying a_bit extra
they_are working on getting their liquor license
so our bill_was cheaper than normal anyhow
i_had aloo_gobi and my_husband_had chicken_korma
their vegetable_samosas were_very_good
served_with two dipping_sauces
you_can pick the_spiciness_of your dish from_one to ten
i_got_a and_felt it_was_very mild and_my_husband got_a and_said it_felt more_like_a so go much spicier_than you normally would
the_service_was very_polite_and prompt we_will_definitely go there_again from_the look of_the_menu
we_will have_many other_things to_try
also
i_will_be trying their lunch_special soon much cheaper and many_options there
this girl
points to self with_both thumbs
is soooo lucky to_have good eats around her
woot
indian_curry_bowl is_another semi fast_food semi sit down joint in_the northwest las_vegas area_and also down_the_street from market grille cafe
it's_located just down from fresh easy and in_the_same shopping_center as hr fitness and cafe rio
all_the_dishes are mom cooked and_the mama's and_staff are_all super_nice
too
even though i_haven't_tried everything
i_can confidently jump to_the conclusion that_everything is_probably pretty_good
the_curry isn't as thick as_other curries i've_had
but_i definitely like the_flavor resulting from_all the_spices
you_can asked_for_the chili on_the side if you're eating with_people with different acceptance levels of_heat
personally
i luv that stuff
gimme gimme gimme
here's what_i tried so_far
per the_owner
all chicken used in dishes is chicken_breast
garlic_naan slightly charred
but_it_was nice and_chewy
lil' bit_of burnt taste gives it flavor
haha
vegetable_samosa deep_fried
but_not_too greasy at_all
when do_i ever say
no
to deep_fried
butter_chicken similar_to chicken_tikka
chicken_tikka_masala
tomato based curry
chicken_saag
spinach based stew
chicken_korma
coconut based curry
p
s
they_have_a lunch_special for_a curry_bowl that's
depending on_the extras you_get
yummy curry_on fluffy rice happy lunch_time nap
woohoo
first_off
thanks_to julia and michelle for putting reviews in
i_was treated to a_lunch that_i've been waiting two_years for
much like market grille
it_is run_by the mom
this_is what_the nw was_missing
i_really can't add much_that hasn't already been said except please be_sure_to treat yourself soon
i_had_the chicken_korma
veggie_samosas and_garlic_naan for_about
and_it filled me_up for_both lunch and_then as_a leftover for_dinner
i_love eating_here
it is_my_favorite_indian_restaurant in_las_vegas
i usually_get the_chicken_tikka for guilt free dining
but_everything on_the_menu_is great
i_highly_recommend_the korma dishes
i_love indian_curry_bowl
every_time_i head to_las_vegas i_have to_make_a trip there
the_food_is simply amazing
the_butter_chicken is_awesome and the_daal makhani is_awesome
ask_for it extra_spicy
id also_like to_say_that their stuffed naan_bread_is hands_down_the best tasting naan ive ever_had
that says alot because_i have quite_a few_indian friends
ive read of other_people complaning about the_prices and_i_have_to disagree the prices_are_reasonable especially considering_that the_quality_of_the_food is top_notch
the_only_thing i'd_have to complain about is_that_they dont have_a beer or wine license
i'd_love to_have_a good beer or nice bottle_of_wine with their_food
i_actually cant wait til the_next_time im able to_visit las_vegas again
this_is_one_of_my favorite_restaurants in_lv
especially for_indian_food
the best_part_is it_is_in summerlin
the couple that own this_restaurant are sweet_and adorable
thank goodness they_are in retirement and_decided_to open a_restaurant in_lv in_their spare time
my favorites_are
saag_paneer
butter_chicken
onion_naan was_delicious too
i_also_like their tomatoe based curry_dishes
mango pudding was_delicious for_dessert
i'm impressed
although my_husband and_i_have_been eating_here for months after a_recommendation from_a_friend
tonight was_the_first_time i_had a_chance_to chat_with the_chef owner rita
i_am truly in awe about_how much she knows about food allergies
and_the lengths at which she goes to ensure that anyone who eats in her restaurant_has a_good_experience
no matter_what allergy they may_have
she_also cooks with pure
organic vegetables and_spices and_will custom make orders to suit your taste
don't wait a_minute more_to treat yourself to_a meal_here
i've recently become addicted to_indian_food
and had_heard about_this great things_about this_place_for sometime
i_finally deceided to_give_it_a_try yesterday evening
man am_i glad_i_did
the_food gods have smiled upon this_restaurant
befor eyou walk_in you_can smell the_curry from the_outside
mmmm
i_ordered_the chicken_vindaloo
extra_spicy and_garlic_naan and_it_was some_of thee best_i've ever_had
the_naan_was light_and airy delicious
i_could_have eaten two baskets of_it
the_chicken_vindaloo portion was_huge
i_was_able_to split it_with my_husband_and we_both walked out full
this_place_is definitely going_to_be seeing a_lot_of more me in_the near future
so_glad places_like this exist in_vegas
a funny thing happened here in_las_vegas
the couple that owned and ran the_samosa_factory had one_of_the finest indian_restaurants here in_town
well
they sold it_off to a_new agey couple who_have proceeded_to debase what the_original owners created
then they retired
then this_place called the indian_curry_bowl opened to_a deserving lack_of fanfare
things weren't going well until_the icb people coaxed rita and her husband out_of retirement and once_again las_vegas has these wonderful chefs running one_of_the_best_indian places_in_vegas
the_food_here_is top grade
rita is an_indian_food goddess
taste one_of her mango pies for proof
the lamb_dishes are_always cooked_well meaning tender_and moist
the_lamb_biryani is a_good_choice to highlight this
the chicken_dishes retain the_flavors in all_the_dishes
without being dry or overpowered
try_the sweet and_sour curry_chicken for_a hot
flavorful dish done to_perfection
the_service on_the_other_hand is can_be lacking though
rita's husband helps out here_when needed and helps smooth over the_lack_of professionalism of_the remaining wait_staff
this_is_the weakest element to_the business
along_with_the not made_for human shaped tables
bad design and harmful to functionality
and_a_little music would fill in_the sound space as_well
this_place_is not_going_to impress anyone on decor or service
but_once they taste_the wonders coming out_of_the kitchen
well
the_food speaks for itself
so
yeah
i_was_really_excited about this_restaurant after_reading_the reviews_here and have_to agree the_food_is phenomenal
i_had_a wonderful butter_chicken
i_haven't_had indian_food_that good since returning_to the_states
very nicely seasoned
naan wasn't greasy_and the_portion was_more_than_enough for_lunch_the_next_day
with a_second order_of_naan
i_can't in good conscience give_this_place higher than stars
however
because the_wait_staff_was absolutely atrocious
i_went_there with_my_husband and_our friend and_we_were happy_to_see that_we_had the_place mainly to ourselves
we love_indian_food_and had reviewed the_menu online before we_came
we_told our_waitress we_were ready_to order
i_went first and_ordered the_butter_chicken
level spicy
she stared at me_for a_second as_if i_wasn't speaking english
after repeating myself a_couple_of_times
she actually took the_menu_and stared at it like she'd never seen it_before
very strange
she mumbled something_about her husband
huh
finally_got it straight and_then shuffled over_to the_kitchen
she_brought over our appetizers
but couldn't remember who_had what
the_same happened with our_entrees there_are only three of_us in_the_restaurant
you_really couldn't get_that right
but the_most egregious was during_the meal
a_good waiter waitress knows how_to interject to_see_if you_need something
the_two girls in_the_restaurant had this_really strange habit of hanging out near the_table until all_three of_us stopped talking to_look in_their direction because_of_the creepy staring
then
instead_of i_don't_know
asking if we_needed more water
they_would comment on_our conversation
we_tried to_be polite about_it
but_after the_third or fourth time
we_started making things up for_them to_get
more water
tea
soda
napkins
just so_we_could continue our conversation
not_that that helped much
it was_such_a relief when other patrons came_in and_they_were too_busy to hover
the_food_is_good enough that_i_will do take_out orders
but_i most certainly won't be_eating in again
creepy
i_had_to_try this_place after hearing so_many good_things about it_and_it certainly did_not_disappoint
i'm not_really an_indian foodie but here goes
the_chicken_korma with_rice was_absolutely_amazing
the creaminess of_the coconut milk and spiciness_of the_sauce made_for a_perfect combination_of flavors
the_garlic_naan_was light
fresh_and equally flavorful
warning
if_you_get this takeout
your car will smell like garlic for_days
the curry_chicken bowl lunch_special
extra_spicy
was_tasty_and full_of spices
it was_the_perfect portion for_lunch
i_have_only ordered_take_out on_the visits i_have made
the_place seems_to be really slow
so_i hope it picks up soon
i_know i will_be_going back soon
i've heard that the_samosas_are the_best
very watery korma
the_naan had the_texture of baked pizza dough
the_only good_thing was_the tartness of_the mango_lassie
they_were the_previous owners of samosa_factory
but their_food didn't seem_to carry over
samosa_factory has surpassed this_place greatly
this_place_is decent
my_friend_and_i were looking_for_a late_lunch after_a hike at_mt charleston
i_always want_to try somewhere i've never been
so_i_can yelp it of_course
i_won't pretend that i_know_what authentic_indian_food tastes_like
the bottom_line for_me is whether or_not i enjoyed_it
i honestly couldn't care less about authentic
i_ordered_a lamb curry_bowl lunch_special
along_with some roti_and a_mango_lassi
everything_was good
maybe i'm_just too americanized
but the_portion_was pretty tiny
it costs
for_a curry_bowl and_then you add for_the_lamb
or_chicken or shrimp
that's
for a_tiny bowl_of curry
fortunately
the roti_and the_lassi rounded out_my meal_and managed_to fill me_up
like_i said
the_food_is indeed good
it_just seems overpriced
you're paying in_the mid teens for a_regular entr_e
maybe the_decor threw me_off
the_location and appearance suggest a cheaper price point
next_time
i'll take my_indian friend's advice and check out india_palace
man
now i'm hungry for some_more curry
we_went_here back_in january
the_service_was really slow
the food_was_ok but_very small_portions for_the_price and i_don't_like big servings
i cook better_indian_food at_home
service_was_good_and fast
food_was_great
the_owner suggested the_korma because i_have_never tried it_and_it did_not_disappoint
my fiance and_i_had_a craving_for good_indian_food
we_usually would_go to india_oven but decided_to pick a local place closer_to our house
indian_curry_bowl is_in_the northwest part_of_town in_a_very quiet shopping_center
considering it's location the_prices_were rather steep
for_most lunch entrees
they_do however
have_a lunch_special
curry bowls starting around dollars and_then dollars extra_for anything you'd like to_add
ie
vegetables
korma sauce
chicken
etc
the_husband
who i_think_is the_owner
was_somewhat friendly
a_little odd and certainly pushy
we_placed our_order and_he told_me to_try_something else instead
we_both decided_on chicken_curry bowls for_lunch_and he convinced me_to_try the_korma sauce
when asked_how spicy we'd like our_lunch
i_ordered_a and_my fiance ordered_a
then
we ordered_naan
plain_naan
yes
plain_naan
we_get our bowls
small
but looked appealing
we taste them
bland_and the_same level_of spiciness for_both
non existent
there_was no_spice in either bowl
the_lady at a_table near us_ordered a ten and_asked_for more spice because it_wasn't spicy_at_all
i_think she had_to_ask_for more spice times
later
our_naan came
garlic_naan
oops
he must've decided_on that for_us as_well as that korma sauce
although
it_wasn't spicy_and wasn't the_best_indian_food
we_didn't think_it_was awful
we_ate it
we_got_our dollar bill and_gave him dollars to_get_some change
he smiled and_said
thank_you
before_we had_to_ask_for change
he looked puzzled but brought_us change
overall
not awful
it_was_worth a_shot but_we aren't going back
service_was mediocre and the_food_wasn't up_to par
i'd rather drive several miles to_get_to a_great_indian_restaurant in_vegas
i_ordered_the lunch_special
butter_chicken
and also_ordered the_lunch_special chicken_korma_and mango_lassi to_go
the_only_other indian_place i've_been_to was mt
everest during_the_lunch_buffet and_mint
and_then i_was hooked to_indian_food
i_am by no means an expert in indian_food_so bear that in_mind
now
the_food
comparing the_chicken_makhani
butter_chicken
from_here to everest and_mint
indian_curry bowl's is_a_lot less creamier with more_of_a spicy raw tomatoey kick
since_i'm so accustomed_to that super creamy milky tomato sauce at_first i_was_a_bit disturbed but as_i continue to_eat i wondered if there_was_also_a healthy version_of indian_food
by no means was_it bad
in_fact it_felt extremely healthy and expertly made_with spices_and such
it's_just i_wanted that thick super creamy_sauce
which i_don't_even know_if that's
authentic
it_just appeals to my_taste_buds more
service_was_good
establishment hired a_new waitress
checked if everything_was okay
drink was_filled
etc
nothing stellar but_i never really_had high hopes either way
it's_not some super fancy restaurant_in the_first_place
i'd go_back
the_total for_two lunch_specials
butter_chicken_and chicken_korma
with mango_lassi_was near
oh_and since so many_people kept complaining about portions
we must_have some beastmode eaters here
i_eat a_lot and_it_was enough for_me_to feel really full
although takeout will_be_a liiiiiiiittle smaller in portions because_of_the plastic container they_use
and i_have_a sneaking suspicion that maybe instead_of giving me butter_chicken they_gave me_that chicken_tikka thingy
which_i heard isnt as creamy as butter_chicken
hmmm well i'll give_it another go
updated
ordered the_butter_chicken again
this_time
although the_texture was_still a_bit watery
the_taste had_that creamy milky taste
i_was served by arnand this_time
perhaps he_was in_an iffy mood today
wish the_new waitress served me this_time
she_was a_lot_more friendlier
the_food_is_amazing
i_went to_get_the vegetarian wrap lunch_special
and_i didnt expect it_to_be that_great but_i_will definately be_back after today
definately one_of_my new favorite_places to_eat
seems_like it_is family_owned and_i_loved how nice they all_were and_the care they_put in their_food
all i_have_to_say is you_should definately eat_here
i_was super excited to_try_this_place
since the_reviews were so_great
i_should_have known it_was_not going_to_be a_good_experience since_there was_not_a single soul in_the_restaurant
i_was_so disappointed
it_still astounds me_to this day
me and_my_boyfriend tried out_their lunch_specials
i ordered_a_chicken curry_bowl and_he ordered_a shrimp_curry bowl
our_server
which seemed to_be_the owner
asked_us how_spicy we_wanted it
so we_told him medium
then_he proceeded_to mumble something_about baby food
when_we_got our_food it_was utterly horrible
it_was_a watery bowl of_rice_and chicken
with no_flavor whatsoever
my boyfriends lunch was the_same
except his shrimp was_still grey
the_owner_and other workers seemed_to be looking something up_on their computer
but_when they finally_got around_to checking on_us
because i_believe i_was loudly conversing with my_boyfriend about_my disdain for our_lunch
we_asked him to_cook the_shrimp longer
and_told him there_was not much_flavor
he went_on to blame us for_the flavoring
saying_that we_wanted it not_spicy
but_that he_could bring_us flavoring on_the side
and that_we_were that ones that wanted baby food
he_also informed us_that we_did_not order the_right thing
and_that if_we_had asked him he_would have told_us what was_good
let me ask you dear sir
why is_it even on_your menu if you_know it sucks
adding the_curry paste improved it slightly
but don't_get_me_wrong it_was_still gross
when_we checked out we_had_to find him to_get_our check
he informed us_that we_didn't like_the_food
and_it_was because_it_was food we_were_not use to
i_am asian and_my_boyfriend is white
but_that does not mean that_we have_never_had good_indian_food
overall the_service_was absolutely terrible
the man was condescending as_well as ignorant
all_of this for_the grand price_of
the_worst i_ever spent in_my_life
i_walked_in pm on_a_tuesday night
it_was_really slow
in_fact we_were_the_only ones in_the_restaurant
we_were_greeted by the_waitress and_told we_could sit anywhere
the_room was arranged nicely
there_was soft jazz playing overall a_good ambiance
the_service_was quick_and to_the_point
we_shared_the whole chicken_tandoori
which ended up being too_much and_we only_had half
the_chicken_was fresh but_i_felt like_it needed something else
we_also_had_the garlic_nan which_was hot_and_fresh
overall the_experience was_good
i_will come_back to_try_out the_rest_of_the menu
hopefully soon
food_was_great
prices_were high for_what_you got
it's_been about months since_i last visited indian_curry_bowl
and_i'm sad to_say_it is_because the_quality_of_food has seriously gone down
back approximately a_year ish ago
they_were_so bomb
i_thought owner andy was funny as_the sarcastic grumpy old man
rita
wife
would_come out_and ask_us how the_food_was
i'm sad_to read that he's coming across as grumpy and condescending
and_i_can definitely see why
in_the_last few visits
gone now is_the consistency
no_more fantastically flavorful curries and_yes
the portion_sizes_are getting smaller
even the_naan comes_out soggy
conclusion
please
bring back_the tasty indian_curry_bowl that i_knew so_well
service_was awful
the mean owner should_not
be serving this_place
he_was rude_and just grumpy
i_love what the_previous person
the_owner should_not be_in the_building
the_food_was_excellent though
ill be_back
yea
the_curry and_naan_were good
but way overpriced_for the_dishes
service_was_also slow
both the_butter_chicken_and saag_paneer entrees_are outstanding
the_naan_was warm_and tasty
portions seem like they_should be bigger considering the_price
fresh
quality_ingredients
friendly_and local
a_little_pricey
maybe it's fair considering how_good it s
but two entrees
two breads
and_a pop came_to around
i_would_highly_recommend this_to a_friend_and will continue to_eat_there
both_times that i_have_been_here
it's_been dead
excellent chicken_korma_and service
had_the_chicken naan
lamb samosas
chicken_tikka_and the_chicken_korma
the_korma we_ordered mild spice
it_was_a_little watery_and since we_went months_ago
the portion_size had diminished
the_chicken_tikka my_hubby ordered super hot
it_was_not
but had_some heat to_it
the_samosas_were tasty
but a_bit greasy and_the_naan_was a hit with_my and year olds
overall
definitely_going back
the_food_comes out piping_hot_and freshly made
which i_love
and_all_of the_flavors_are there that_i look_for in_indian_food
this_is a_nice_little family_owned restaurant_with polite_and prompt service
but relaxed enough_to seat yourself
i_love_it and_i try to_go every few_months
we_ordered lunch from indian_curry_bowl yesterday
and_i_can't say_enough about_how horrible it_was
not_just the_food
but the_entire experience
the_food_was_very overpriced
for_entrees
side
and orders_of samosas
the_total came_to
i_was shocked
and looked over_the receipt
they_were charging me_for chutney
i eat_indian_food from many_different establishments on_a_regular bases
and the_chutney is_always complimentary
it's_like charging for ketchup
while_i_was waiting_for my_order
i_was watching the elderly woman prepare the_food using
a microwave
really
no burners or stoves going
just a_couple_of microwaves
the_food_was_not good at_all
the_samosas_were soggy and undercooked
the_chicken_tikka_masala and_saag_paneer were runny and looked_like they literally had_been mixed_with water
so basically
i_paid over for_food that_was microwaved
seriously
i'm_still appalled by that_one
and terrible
never again
food was_mediocre at_best
chicken_tikka_masala_was not creamy
had very_little chicken
and_had no_real flavor
saag_paneer_was relly runny and the_cheese was tough
the_naan_was_good
but how_can you screw up naan
severely overpriced
the_owner acted like_he was_doing me a_favor with_the prices_and said_that he_had new menus already printed with higher prices
i_will_definitely not_be_returning
the_wife and i_ended_up here today after discovering that saffron_flavors_of_india has temporarily closed
i'm sad_to report that this_place_is easily the_worst a_la_carte indian_experience i_have_had in_las_vegas
my_wife ordered paneer_tikka_masala and_i_ordered my standard chicken_tikka_masala
we_also_had our standard mix_of garlic and_plain_naan which_we love_to use_the mop up all_the lovely rich creamy gravy that_you usually associate with_indian_food and these_dishes in particular
what arrived was_not rich
creamy or_even remotely lovely
they_seem to_take_the
healthy take on_indian_food
to extremes here
my tikka_masala looked_like it_had_been prepared by throwing a_few pieces_of_chicken tikka into_a mixture_of blended onion
tomato
green peppers
and cilantro which_had then been cut with about a_cup_of water until watery_and tasteless
we heard the microwave going during_the preparation
so i'd say that's pretty much exactly what_was happening
imagine what you'd get if you microwaved a can of
if_it existed
progresso low fat
low sodium indian curry_chicken soup
there's something extremely wrong_with your chicken_tikka_masala when no matter how many_times you re dip your chicken_in_the
sauce
it_comes up completely devoid of anything covering it
the_chicken itself_was bland
waterlogged and soaked free of_any flavour whatsoever
we didn't_really have_much use for_our naan since_there was no_real gravy here
but_my garlic_naan_was pretty tasteless
the_only minor saving grace of_the_meal was_the excellent home_made lemonade and_the passable samosas we began our_meal with
to round things all off
a bill of close_to for a_terrible meal in_a_restaurant that felt like_a subway landed on_the_table and i_knew the_second star i was_going_to award this_place just_for_the lemonade and_friendly_service was gone
if_you're_a health fanatic who likes vaguely chili flavoured water with_your chicken
paneer etc
then this_place might be for_you
if_your looking_for wonderful silky sauces_and creamy
nutty tastes
run as_far from indian_curry_bowl as_you_can
this_is our go_to restaurant
if we_don't eat_here at_least_once_a_week the cravings won't go away
each_dish is prepared to_order with the_highest quality_ingredients
i_would_highly_recommend if_you_are vegetarian_and even_if_you aren't try_some_of the_vegetarian_dishes
the_owners andy and rita have_such a passion and_love for preparing food_with the_most amazing flavors
for anyone who_is complaining about the_cost
take_a step back_and remember you_get what_you_pay for
very_disappointing for what_you_pay
the_onion and_garlic_naan was_the_best part_of_the_meal
other then that nothing stood out or made_me want_to add this to_my list_of go_to restaurants
we_got_there at and_they close at
but the_owner_was rushing us_and pretty much pushed us_out the_door
there_were_a_few desserts we_were eying but_he would_not allow us_to try_them
so in_the_end we_will not be_back
i_am_not an_indian_food expert by_any_means but_i do like to_try_new places
i_stopped by and_they_had a_sign for_a_lunch_buffet for
but_i wasn
t sure_if i_wanted a_buffet
the i_looked at_the_menu and_saw the_prices
i_guess the_lunch_buffet sounds good
they_had about menu_items i_tried
meatballs
chicken_curry
butter_chicken
rice
okra
and_some garbanzo bean thing
the_only item i_didn't_like too_much was the_butter_chicken
the_chicken_was dry
the meatballs had_a healthy dose of cumin which was_a_little strong for_my_taste
the_chicken_curry was_tasty
my_favorite menu item_was the_okra dish
the_place_is nice_inside
i_am guessing the fella working_there is the_owner
not_exactly mister personality
but_i had_the_buffet so_he didn't_have_to do much
i_read some reviews_and i_do agree that the_prices seem steep for_this type_of place
for_those prices i_would_like_to see some belly_dancers or_something
overall i_would_say better_than average_food and decent value for_the_lunch_buffet
i was_craving_indian_food one evening_and my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in north las_vegas
saffron
is_still temporarily closed
i_was_really heading to fresh and_easy to_pick_up a_few items when_i spotted indian_curry_bowl
i_had_been curious about_this_place for_a_while and looked up reviews_on_yelp
i_remembered the microwave issues yet my man thought_that having a_large table inside was a_good_sign
i_thought_that having only table at pm_on_a saturday was a_bad sign
to_make_a long story short
we_ordered vegetable_samosa
lamb_samosa
salty lassi
chai
garlic_naan_and sweet and_sour curry
by the_way
they no_longer serve curry bowls
right after we_ordered i_heard a microwave go_on
that's okay probably for my_water for_my chai
the microwave went_on times
now please understand that the_kitchen is_in_the open
if they_did cook anything fresh one_would hear so
nobody cooked anything fresh
the microwave did all_the cooking
the salty lassi was_the_only item made_fresh
my chai had_a tea bag
the_chicken in_our curry_was tandoori_chicken cut up_in chunks
strange
the_samosas lacked flavor_and were dry
the_chutneys were_okay
again
they_used a microwave to_cook
as_for_the bill
well we_were charged for the_garlic_naan that never made_it to_our_table
at_the_time we_ordered
we_were_the_only table being_served
by_the_time_we got the_bill we_were of tables
total of_people
my man called him over and_said we never_got our_naan
he looked around on_our_table to be_sure because he_didn't remember if he_had made naan
really
using a microwave to_cook star
cute restaurant
food mediocre and_not authentic
i_guess this_place caters to gringo palates
we_ordered samosas which_were pretty_good
the_naan was_a_bit lacking_in flavor
myself and_a companion who_were familiar_with_indian cuisine ordered_the matar paneer_and vegetable kofta
food wasn't_bad
but lacking_in spice_and deep traditional_indian flavor
this was_disappointing as we_had specifically requested that our_food be_very spicy
the_rest_of our_party ordered lamb_korma_and chicken_tikka_masala_and were generally pleased as_they liked their food_on_the milder side
the_owner
who acted as our_waiter
was stingy with_the rice
he_brought us one bowl for five people_and gaped at_us when_we_asked for_more
mid dinner service
not that_we_were being greedy
but_this_was like the_size_of a cereal bowl
when most_indian_restaurants will give_you_a serving bowl
he_then proceeded_to bring_us half_a cereal bowl full_of rice then said
ok guys this_is all we_have
really
he_then paced around the_restaurant then glared at_us until we_left
i understand that we_came about an_hour before closing
which can_be annoying for_most restaurant staff
but_there_were also two_other couples dining
way to_get_your message across
i get_it
you_want us to_get_the f ck out
noted
so_we quickly finished and_left
needless to_say_i will_not_be_returning
i've had_better_indian_food in_the backwoods of north carolina
service_was fast
food is_ok in_a pinch if you're desperate
but for_me
indian_curry_bowl is_to indian_food_as taco bell is_to mexican_food
this_was_our second_visit to_the indian_curry_bowl
we_ate there shortly after it opened
and_decided then never to_go_back
it_was_very expensive
especially for_the no frills location and_decor
there_was no_one in_the_place at pm except us
and they_still got our_order completely wrong
but it's_been awhile
and_there_is_a sign_that says best of_las_vegas
is_there a_restaurant that_isn't on the_best of_las_vegas list
so_we_went in_for_the_lunch_buffet
the troll that owns the_place_is almost enough_to make_you flee in fright
but_we suffered through him anyway
there_were about different_things on_the_buffet table
two chicken_dishes
meatballs and_the_rest vegetarian_dishes
naan at the_beginning of the_table should_have been enough to_make us change our mind
it_was charred
flat and_dry
but we_took a_piece anyway
the_chicken_curry was_okay
and_the
butter
chicken
whatever that_is
wasn't too_bad either
however
most_of the_rest_of_the dishes_were less than good
naan
usually one_of_our guilty pleasures
was_awful
we_have_eaten in_many
many_indian_restaurants here_and around_the_world and are_very familiar_with_indian_food
bad and_good
origin india in_las_vegas
in_our opinion
is_the very best in_town
and india_oven is_pretty_good too
there_were only_two other_tables of_people in_the_restaurant while_we_were there
at_the noon hour
and one_of_them was eating_the food_with gusto
i_don't_want_to question their taste
because this_place_has been_open for_a_couple of_years
so_there must_be some_people who like_it
however
we_don't
and won't be_going back
the_best_indian_food_i've_ever had
their_lamb is cooked_to_perfection
first few_times i tried_this_place
i_liked what_i usually order which_is chicken_korma curry_with rice_and_naan
i'd only go when i'd_have the urging for_curry and bc it_is_in my neighborhood
but_i'd spend an easy even just for_my small lunch and_always thought_it_was overpriced
i_was_so pleased to_see their_lunch_buffet for
during_the week
on_weekends
i've been twice now and_each_time i_had a_little_bit_of every item
which were_all nicely flavored
both_times
finished everything on_my_plate and was_super happy
so spending a_for weekend_buffet
drink_and tip was_worth to_me bc i_got to try_everything instead_of just_one item for the_same_price
service_and ambiance there has_always been_a_little lack luster
but_they must_be reading their reviews bc the_old man was_no where_to be_found and the_wife was_super welcoming_and friendly
and_they_had an attentive bus boy to_help out
i_think_they need some nice_indian music_playing to kill the monotony
but_i'm glad they_are still open and in_the_neighborhood
i'd_recommend trying the_buffet during_the week for_the_best deal
we_had take_out_and it_was_pretty_good for las_vegas indian_food
we_had different_dishes and_each of_them was_delicious
the_nan_was okay
the_garlic_nan could of used a_little_more garlic
overall it_was_good though
check_it_out if_you_are_in_the area
i_go before closing and_order the_tandori_chicken
they_serve it_with bell peppers_and onions
it ask comes with_rice_and lemons
i_order rai cucumber sauce_and garlic_nan
the_owner is_very_friendly_and always knows what_i want
nice to_see a_family_run business
the_chai ice tea is_good too
will_try buffet soon
my_wife picked up orders_of lamb_and_chicken vindaloo_and naan
the_vindaloo was_supposed_to_be level_of for heat
it_was_so bland i_would_say it_was_actually level
the_naan_was very_dry and_did_not even hold together
it_was_like bread particle board
not_a_good meal
but_it_wasn't over
hrs later i began to_have_the most violent episode of_food poisoning i_have experienced in_years
hours of projectile fluids coming out both ends
i_am lucky i_was the_only_one in my_family eating_the curry_bowl fare
i_will_never go near_the place_again
but_hey
at least it_was_too expensive
i_have_been_here times
i_don't_know why i've chosen to_go so many_times
but each time has not_been a_good_experience
my old roomie said_it_was her favorite indian_food_in_town
it_must have_been the_only_place she's ever_tried
horrible service
very_bland food
i_was_craving indian for_lunch
and_this_was the_only_place in_the northwest at_the_time
i ordered_take_out
took longer than i_was_told
charged me_for the_extra rice_and_naan i_ordered
but failed to_give_it to_me
again
the_food_was_very bland_and watery
they_had just advertised a_new buffet_for_lunch
my_boyfriend_and_i had both agreed this_place_was not_very_good
but_we decided_to_give_it one_more try for_the_buffet
horrible service
and_very distasteful food
they_didn't direct us_to anything
just expected us to_know how_it worked didn't ask_us if we_needed anything
there_was hardly any food_to chose from and_what there_was available was_cold and hardly any left
if you've never_had_indian_food
this_place_will most likely not ever give_you_a good impression of_it
finally there's indian_cuisine in_the southwest part_of_the valley
opened april
and looks promising to_me
located_on the northeast corner_of mcdowell litchfield
contemporary atmosphere
nice stylish square plates
but limited seating
very_nice menu_with traditional_indian favorites
plus some_of_the uncommon items_that i've_found in cities
such_as chicago
that offer more diversity in indian_cuisine
for example
i_don't normally see bhindi_masala
mushroom palak
and my_favorite bombay aloo
beautiful cumin seed spiced potatoes
tandoori breads are reasonably_priced
which_is certainly a change_from_the norm in_the west valley
again the_menu offers more diversity garlic roti
gobi parantha
paneer naan
in_addition_to the_usual favorites
they're all rather small_and circular
flat thin like tortillas though which_isn't too exciting
there_are about appetizers to_choose_from
which is_a_nice change_from_the west valley competition which offers just_a_couple
or only offers them_on saturday and sunday afternoons
prices overall are_quite reasonable
open days a_week
for_lunch
and_dinner
to pm
buffet offered main course entrees to_choose_from
with choice_of bread
and_vegetable pakoras_were a_tasty appetizer
only_complaint_is_that the_staff owners have_a heavy accent and_it_was difficult_to communicate at_times
for ethnic cuisine
though
is_this such_a flaw
we've been twice for_the_buffet
we_are happy_to report that sutra has one_of_the tastiest and_most diverse indian_buffets_in town
favorites include chicken_tikka_masala_and vegetable_pakoras
diners are given a_choice_of plain or garlic_naan
it's_not all raves and applause the bismati rice was_a_bit over or undercooked
crunchy
on my_last_visit
and_on both occasions the owner's long winded chit chat actually kept us_from enjoying our_lunch while it_was_still piping_hot
still
as_far as_indian restuarants in_the_valley go
this_one_is tops
we hope sutra
opened in april
will_be_a fixture in goodyear
we don't_want_to go_back_to driving to glendale or tempe to_find decent
or meh
indian cusine
i_must_say
i_am_a picky_about my_indian_food
when this_place came_to goodyear
i_was stoked
i_have_been driving over_to bell road to_satisfy cravings for_indian and_that_was for mediocre satisfaction
i'm_always a_bit worried to fall in_love_with a_restaurant
especially in this_area
as_most are gone within two_years
but_i_did
i_have_been_to sutra seven times_now_and every single time i_think
god i_hope this_place makes_it
this_restaurant has climbed to_my top three favorite indian_restaurants
the_food_is nothing short_of amazing
each time
a_bit different
but always very_good
the_buffet_is my_favorite b c i_like_to try all_of_the flavors
they_have five vegetarian_entrees and three or four meat_dishes
there_is nothing on_the_buffet that i_wouldn't eat again
the_tikka_masala sauce_is rich_and flavorful_and is spiced just_right
the_palak_paneer
they call it something else
is_also wonderful
the_service_has improved since opening and_the
son
is_very professional and_is johnny on_the spot
my_drink never_went below full_and i_can_get in_and_out in_minutes if i_need_to
it's_the
father
who cooks and i_think_the recipes he_has brought to_this_restaurant are truly unique
if_you_love indian_food
or_even if_you_don't
please check_this gem out
and_in response to another's comment on seating
it's_a_nice modern place
well_decorated and_there_is plenty of seating even at noon sharp
when_they first opened they_were slammed
but things have settled down_to normal business now
they_also_have_a full_bar with_some very interesting wine selections
i take everyone i_know there just_so they_can experience truly excellent_indian_food
yum
living_in laveen
there_are not a_ton_of indian_places to_visit
unless you_want to_take_a little trip
the_bf and_i were_looking_for something different
something we_don't normally have
after a_little_bit_of yelping
we_found_this_place
neither one of_us have had_indian_food
and yelpers seemed_to like here
so we_thought we'd give it_a_shot
although urban spoon gives completely opposite reviews
we decide
eh why_not
i'm super glad_we braved it_out
because everything_was real good
the_bf asked_what my_favorite_dish was
and_i_didn't have_an immediate response to_this question
one bit
food_was_great
i_really_liked_the flavors
everything we_ordered seemed_to be tomato based as everything had_a redish color
i_don't_know_if this_is typical indian_food_or not
but_it could_be
anytime the_bf and_i try something out
we normally order things to_try_out and_of_course end_up taking a_bunch home
but i_think_it's only fair to_us
and to_the_restaurant in_order for_us all to_get_a feel for each_other
i_wish_i_had a pen and pad so i_can_say what_we_had
but i'll_try to_describe as_much as possible
we_had_a lamb dish_that_was served_in_a tomato sauce with_potatoes
and i_ended_up calling this my_favorite
come_to think_of it this_is actually the_only_one i_didn't_know
i_know_it was_in_the lamb section of_the_menu towards the_bottom
then we_went_with the_chicken something masala
they_have_a regular masala
and we_went_with the_one with words
haha
it_was_very_good too
little_bit oily
and_the_chicken to_me was very_dry
almost flakey
then we_went_with the_beef curry just in_case we_didn't like the_other too
this_dish was real good_too
we_ordered this with a_side_of_rice
which_was fantastic
i_loved_the rice
its basamati rice
was_very fluffy_and light
i_loved that the_rice didn't take over my whole meal_and fill me_up before_i could enjoy each_dish
sauce
is_more what i'd call it
considering you really_need the_rice
all in_all
we'll definitely_go back_here
i_guess until we_actually try another_indian spot_on our_way home_from work or_something
the_place_is small
they_had cute plates
a_little bar
that seems as_if it_will grow if the_people come
i_can_see upgrading the stars with time
and experience
oh_yeah
those things
plus the_rice came_to just under
so definitely sweet on_the pocket
delicious_indian_food
as_good_as_the dhabas in_india and los angeles
my_family was so_excited to_see_this place open
i_do hope it makes_it
go_there and_try for_yourself
you will_find amazing_food
great_service
and_a television for_your sports viewing pleasure
they_also_have_a full_bar
which_is an added plus
my_fellow goodyear avondale peeps get out_of_the chains and support this local gem
after spending many years living_in silicon valley
i_couldn't wait for_an_indian_restaurant to_open up_in_the west valley
it's_hard_to list a_favorite because_i loved everything_i tried
garlic_naan
shrimp_vindaloo
curry_chicken
karahi lamb
etc
don't_forget to_try_the mango_lassi_and kheer if_you_have_a sweet tooth
they're family_owned and operated and_all great people
i_love the_decor_and ambiance
and_i_can't wait_to_try their_lunch_buffet and_their beers from_india
one_word
wow
having moved_to buckeye after years of living_in boston
ma
i_have_been suffering miserably without my weekly fix of_indian_food
this_place_is not_just great
but better_than most_indian_restaurants i_have_tried in downtown phoenix
i_really hope this_place stays afloat
as vegetarians
my_boyfriend and_i_ordered_the mushroom bhajii and_the beingan bertha
sorry for_any misspellings
both were_excellent
we_also_had_the vegetable_pakora and_garlic_naan and_everything_was equally as_good
waitstaff were super_nice_and friendly_and genuinely concerned about_how we_liked our_food
we_went_on_a sunday_night and_there_were lots_of diners
though still plenty of seating
it's_a_great size
and i_really_enjoyed_the music
very non descript location in_a shopping plaza
but_then what would arizona be without that
check_this_place out
you_will_not_be_disappointed
i_plan to_return again and_again and_again
very_excited
just_got home_from here
my_first_time eating_indian
i_am quite happy
it_will stick_with me like thai food
i_will crave it_at least weekly now
the_only part i_wasn't impressed_with was the_chicken_biryani
it_tasted_like rice a roni a_little
it smelled like heaven though
we_had garlic_naan_and another chicken_dish
but i_can't_remember the_name
it_was_very_good
i_had_the mango_lassi
very_good
they_also brought_us what the_owner called
indian doughnuts
they_were like wet doughnut holes
very_good
but very_sweet
i could_only eat one
i_am_going_to go for_the_buffet next_time
so_i_can try a_little_of everything
i_recommend trying_it
they may_not make_it
we_were_the_only ones in_there the_whole time we_ate
i_hope more_people go
it_is worth_it
it was_the_first_time for my_husband_and_i to_try indian_cuisine
we_both liked it_very_much
yes
we_will_be coming back_to_this_place
we_ordered_the non_veg assorted snack
seesh kebab
fish pakoras chicken pakoras
for_an appertizer
the seesh kebab was minced lamb mixed_with spcies cooked on skeker in clay_oven
not_like the normal kebab you_think it_is
the_taste_was different
not_my cup_of tea
but the_fish and_chicken parkora was_very_good
for_our_entrees ordered up_a karahi lamb boti masala
boneless tansoori lamb_in a tomatoe and_butter gravy
and chicken_biryani
basmati_rice with chicken_cooked with_nuts
herbs
raisins
and_spices
the karahi lamb_dish was_served as medium and the_chicken_biryani was_served as mild
the lamd dish_was too_hot for_me
but_then i_am_a super lightweight
but the_flavor_was good
i_loved my chicken_biryani
the aromatic rice
herb
and_spices was_just wonderful to smell and_taste
the_waitress suggested the_garlic_naan_bread
it_was_like a pita with small chunks_of garlic_and herb
it was_very_tasty too
we_got_to chatting with the_owners
they_were_very patience to_explain what everything_was and_give us different sauces to_try
cucumber yogurt
minty cream
etc
with our_dishes
they_also brought_out_a sample of the_kheer
rice_pudding
my_husband inhaled it
he_loved it
yes
so_happy to_find indian_food_in_the southwest part_of_the valley
went here_for_the_lunch_buffet good selection_of_vegetarian and_non vegetarian_options
my_favorite_was_the chicken_tikka_masala really flavorful_and tender i_was_able_to cut through it with_a fork
i'll definitely be_back
okay
it_almost seems a_shame to burst the bubble of_the positive_reviews of_this_place
but_i_just have_to
i'm_not an_indian_food expert
but i_am_a serious enthusiast and_i've eaten_at dozens of indian_places on three continents
not_to_mention my_family being from_the vicinity of_that area_of the_world and therefore having grown up_on curry_and rice_and all_things spice
we_went_here for_lunch yesterday
sunday
thanks_to a_yelp aloqa recommendation after we'd had_a romp at estrella mountain park and_were starving
the_place_was almost deserted at pm
with only_one other_table occupied fair enough
we_went_for_the buffet
and_i_have_to_say
it_was simply
okay
the_buffet didn't_have a particularly wide_variety_of stuff several items_were cheap regulars such_as the_saag and_the dhal spinach_and lentils for_the uninitiated
they_did have aloo zucchini
never seen that before tasted okay
about_as good_as i'd_have been_able_to make_it
and_that's actually not_a compliment
no lamb_dishes disappointing
but unfortunately this_is also rare
flavorwise
i_found_it boring and unspectacular
saag is saag
tandoori_chicken_is tandoori_chicken
except their_chicken was very_light on the_tandoori smoke flavour
none_of_the food left the slight zing on_my tongue that_it should_have
rice was_okay
but_then you typically can't_go_wrong_with cooking basmati
although another reviewer's mileage apparently differed on_this count
we_had our almost year old along and_he did_have a_little rice
chicken_and beef it_was his first real curry_and thus a_pretty substantial milestone for_us
then the_wife went to_get_a little kheer and_a gulab_jamun ball
the_kheer was watery but tasted okay compared unfavourably to_the sabudaana kheer at_india_palace
the jamun ball was_almost completely solid you had_to press real hard with_a fork to cut it
normally they're nice_and soft_and soaked
however
another one i_got was normal so_it_was just_the luck of_the draw there
beef curry was_nice
although the_first piece i_ate was mainly fat whatever
you_get that and_i_don't mind it
the_fried pakoras can normally be cut through with_a fork
these you had_to saw through with_a knife not_great
chewy to_the_point of almost being crunchy
no samosas in_the_buffet
the_naan_was unusual
i've had_a_lot_of naan before_and this stuff was_the uncommon kind
not thick_and pita ey but instead a_little more_like_a roti
it_tasted very_fresh we_had plain_and also garlic_and the_wife really liked_it
kid did too
i personally prefer the_other sort of_naan softer and a_little_more substance to_it
but_this_one had merit regardless
however
it_took at least fifteen minutes_after our food_was_served before the_naan arrived
all up
middle_of_the road as_far as_i'm concerned
although the_wife quite liked_it
note that_this_is for_the_buffet only we did_not_have a_la_carte and perhaps_the to_order cooked food may_have tasted better
i've_had better buffets the_best one in_phoenix west of_the imo is india_palace a wider variety
a_lot busier
as a_result
i'm_sure
and_more flavourful food
admittedly
i_haven't_tried any other_indian_places south of bell but west of_the except_for sutra
bell appears to_have most of_them
i_would normally have_given this_place_a flat three stars
but i'm_going_to give_it an_extra half and round up for_a_few reasons
firstly
the_waiter_was real nice_and very_attentive up_to_the standard of_a typical us chain place
rather than_the silent wanderers with_the easter island statue facial expressions at_other buffets who do no more_than refill your water_and clear your dirty dishes every fifteen minutes or_so
he_was asking us how_we were_doing
offered refills of_my wife's iced_tea at appropriate times etc
spot_on
next
there's_a buffet discount where all kids under are however
we noticed_that they appropriately knocked the_price down_to
for_us
unbidden and i_guess for_the simple reason that_he was set_up in_a high chair and obviously only ate of_a breakfast bowl worth of_food in total
third
the_place had nice_decor
although i_was_a_bit concerned there_were_no tablecloths
with_my kid banging his plastic sippy cup and spilling sh t all_over_the tabletop
and thankfully they_didn't_have sh tapple wudda wudda waa waa pretentious bhangra muzak playing in_a cheap attempt at making you_feel_like you're actually in_india
i'd eat_here again
but_only if_i'm in_the_area_and dying for_indian_food
it simply didn't measure up
either buffet wise or flavour wise
for first timers
i_can_see how they_would_have enjoyed_the experience clean seating_area
americanized flavours_and a_good waiter
my_experience
however
has_been burned in over almost four decades and_i've kicked the tyres of more cuisines from_this area_of the_world than i_can recount
especially indian
three and a_half
rounded up_to four
seacrest out
this_review_is_for_the buffet
typical buffet_food
i_had saag
bombay potatoes
tandoori_chicken
curry_chicken and pakoras
i_think_they must leave out the_spices for_the_buffet in_case first timers come_in
the_saag was_good
but_it_wasn't anything special
bombay potatoes were_just meh
this_was however
the_first indian_buffet i_have_been_to where the_tandoori_chicken_was not dry as_a bone
it_was_actually juicy
props for keeping the bones in_the curry_chicken
although there seemed to_be_more bone than meat
and the_pakoras
bleh
i_ordered_a roti_and a parantha
it_was_the weirdest roti i_had ever seen
i_am_going_to agree_with dean ryan s and_say it_looked_like a_mix_of roti_and naan
it_wasn't horrible though
the parantha on_the_other_hand was_dry and_almost burned
i_was_there by myself and_the young guy and older woman were_both very_friendly
at_first the_guy was making conversation with_me keeping me entertained but then_he went in_the_back
i'd return perhaps for_dinner
but_since i_don't live here i_doubt that_will happen
best_indian_restaurant i've_been_to_in forever
i_was spoiled by_the great places_in england
sutra is_as_good if_not better
great_flavors and use_of spices
super_friendly staff
extensive_menu
if_you_are_in_the vicinity you've got_to check_this_place out
we_stopped by for_our first_experience of_indian_food a_little_more then a_week ago
there_was_only my_husband_and_i and one_other couple in the_whole place
the_one waiter spent the_entire time talking to_the_other couple
we_ordered drinks that we_never actually received
at_the suggestion of our_waiter who_was friendly in_the few minutes he actually spent speaking with_us
we_had_the buffet
it seemed_very very_bland
i_was_really_excited to_try_indian food_because i'd heard such wonderful things_about the_flavors
we_will_be trying_indian_food again
but_never from_here
my_wife_and_i love us some_good curry
we_went_here on_a double date and i_like_the cafe type atmosphere
we_were_the_only ones in_the_restaurant for_the_first min
the_food_was_pretty_good
warning
these_guys are serious about spicy
medium is_a normal person's hot_and hot is
wow i'm gonna feel that tomorrow kind of_hot
the_chicken seemed really fatty to_me_and not cooked enough_for my_tastes but_i_like my_chicken well done
since its the_only real_indian place_on the_west_side we'll probably go there_again
i_was running errands and hungry
so_i stopped_in to_get_some lunch
oh_my goodness everything_in the_lunch_buffet_was amazing
i_am new_to_indian_food
but i_love_it
this_place_is_great
sutra here sits in a_large shopping_center
i_would describe it_as_a stylish
mid sized cafe
there's a_full_bar
which features several special wines
plus beer varieties
along_with_the usual well drinks
the salad_bar had_the expected chopped lettuce
sliced tomatoes
cucumbers
purple onions the chopped salsa like topping mix
the_name_of which escapes me
there_were also lemon slices
cut the_right direction
chunks_of cantaloupe
the_naan_bread_was warm but plain
there_were mostly the_usual dishes
including chicken_tikki_masala
tandoori_chicken
something i_hadn't seen before was egg burgy
minced
curried egg with onion
whatever it_was
it_was_good
for_me
though
there_was nothing particularly exciting about_this_place
having both medium and large plates out was a_nice_touch
the matronly server lady was_friendly attentive
the_lunch_buffet_is
it's
a_ok
this_is the_first_time i_have_tried this_restaurant
and_the_atmosphere_is very_pleasant
dinner was_amazing the_soup
the_bread
and_the curry_chicken were_just fantastic
the_spices and_flavors perfect
the_staff was_very_nice_and helpful
i_am recommending sutra to_all of_my_friends
and my_family
i_will_definitely_be returning_to enjoy_this fine indian_cuisine again and_again
it_is also reasonably_priced_and very_clean
it's just_ok
i've_lived in_india and_would have_to_say this_is_an american version_of indian_food
otherwise
i_guess it_would_be quite_tasty had i not visited india
probably_would not re visit
nor recommend
attempted to_have dinner here_tonight
but appears they_were_closed
no signs confirming
but pm on_a_thursday and_not open makes one think they_are gone
if_i find_this to_be in error i_will remove this_review comment
we chose to_go_to india garden on dysart instead
very strong first impression
superior dining_experience
the_decor_is embellished and thoughtful
the_food_was_very tasty
lunch_buffet review to follow in_an update
for_dinner
though
lamb_curry
medium_spicy
vegetable_samosa
of_them as appetizer
garlic nann and
yes
mixed pickle
and_a bottomless coke for around
i_felt the_quality_and quantity of_the_food_was superior
and priced correctly
visitors to_las_vegas should appreciate this_restaurant
please note
to_find_this restaurant from_the_strip
drive on flamingo or tropicana or_even spring mountain westward
up_the slope
until you_get_to valley view
turn right
northward
and drive to sahara at_the stop light with_the rebel gas station
at_the stop light
intersection of valley view and sahara
turn right again
going down_the slope
back toward the_strip
the_restaurant_is immediately on_your right
right_next_to the rebel gas station
in_the_same parking_lot as marianna's supermarket
please do_not attempt to turn left against traffic on_sahara at any_time of_the_day in_an uncontrolled intersection
you'll be thankful for_both the_dining and_the driving experience
enjoy and make_sure_to review this_restaurant
i and co_workers tried_this place_for_lunch
i_was anticipating this_place opening as_soon_as_i saw the_sign that_it_was an_indian_restaurant and_had lunch_buffet so_when it finally opened
we_had_to go
it did_not_disappoint
the_lunch_buffet_is
and_there_is_a great_selection_of food
it's not_the_best_indian that i've_had but_for_the value
it_is excellent
the_thing i_also appreciated was the_naan_was included with_the_meal and_you didn't have_to_pay extra_for it as_i_had at other_indian_restaurants
they_give_you_a choice_of either plain or_garlic so_we_went with garlice
it_was_awesome
hot_and_fresh from_the oven
had herbs_and plenty of_garlic to_our liking
the_service_was_great as_well_as_the servers attended to_our_table and made_sure our_drink glasses_were never empty
they checked regularly to_ask how everything_was
all_of_us left very full_and happy_with our_experience at_mt
everest
we_will_definitely_be returning regularly for_lunch
we_went the st day they_were open and it_was_fantastic
easily the_most variety_of_indian food offered
curries
tons_of veggie_dishes
for_a_lunch_buffet around_town and the_price_is unbeatable
service_was_friendly_and extremely attentive which prob had to_do w this being their grand opening
i_left stuffed beyond belief
highest quality indian_lunch_buffet
wow
very tasty_food
spicy_enough for_most americans
though not_so spicy_for many from_the region
twelve bucks with drink_and tax
very impressive restaurant
this_place has_a_great variety_of_indian dishes
we_were here_for_the_lunch_buffet and were_not_disappointed
the_naan_bread was_a_little fatty and not_as crisp as_i hoped it_would_be but_all other_dishes made_up_for_it
we_will_be_back for_sure
i_took the_family for_the_lunch_buffet_and it_was_the_best indian_buffet in_las_vegas
i_had_been to just_about every indian_buffet_in_town before getting a_recommendation from_a_friend
the_place_was clean
the_food_was well_stocked
and_the fresh_naan that's included with_the
was_excellent
particularly_good was the_chicken_tikka_masala
since_my kids liked_it
i will_be_going back_there often
amazing
amazing_food
even_better price
forget spending
at_a casino buffet when you_can_eat here_for_lunch
trust_me
the_service_is amazing
i_love waiters that fill your drink glass without you asking
well
lets just_say my glass was_always full
this_place_is really really_really reaaly good
it_was_a
yelp it to_get off_the_strip
find
everything made_fresh and
instant
see the_naan on_the_menu
the_buffet_is for_lunch only and_yes
it had_some weird decor
a_couple_of electriic guitars and_a neon billiards sign
go_here
eat_here
love_it
i_have_eaten here_about ten times_now
and_it_is a_pretty new_restaurant
so that_is saying something especially since i_am_a very_picky eater
at_lunch you_can either have_the_buffet or order from_the_menu
at_dinner you_order from_the_menu
many_of_the items on_the_lunch_buffet vary from day to day some days there will_be chana_masala
some days vegetable_korma
etc
it's_always great
i_actually like ordering from_the_menu better
though
the_owner_is_a very_nice guy and works hard to_make_sure his customers have everything they_need
i_have introduced several people to_this_place
and they_all come_here regularly now
and_some_of them are_pretty picky people
too
i give_a star_for the_food_and_service
my_wife_and_i were_a_bit hesitant when_we only saw others eating in_the_restaurant
also it_looks_like a converted burger_king and_the_decor is_a_bit drab
but decided to_try_it anyway
we_had great dishes_and_the naan_was_excellent
if_you_can overlook the_very basic decor_and consider the_food end service
this_place_is_great
we_would eat_here again
a note to the_owners if you read this
get rid of_the florescent lighting and add more soft lighting
maybe get spend a_bit to warm up_the atmosphere_and you_will_have a_winner restaurant
good luck
prices seemed mid range for_indian_cuisine
i_think_we had two_dishes and_naan totaling about before taxes
very fair for quality_food
when_i saw mt_everest getting ready_to open i_was initially a_little put_off by_the locale in_a defunct burger_king building
next_to a gas station
in_a grotty parking_lot outside marianna's mexican supermarket on west sahara
eventually we_tried_the extremely reasonably_priced lunch_buffet_for
and_were immediately blown_away by the_quality_and variety_of_food here
i_am_a meat_eater and_my_wife is_a vegatarian
but_there_is so_much for both_of_us
the_chicken_makhani and_chicken_tikka_masala
these two rotate so you_will_get either one_of_the other
are_both wonderful and_there's always a_few delicious vegetable_dishes that_are cooked_and seasoned to_perfection
vegetables that i_would_never consider eating elsewhere are somehow transformed into pure delights
also_excellent is the_selection_of pakora_and the_large
delicious samosas
i_usually manage to polish off three of_these
freshly cooked naan
so_fresh you almost burn your hands if you aren't careful
is_so_good you_could make_a meal out_of it and_some_of_the sauce from_the_buffet alone
our hosts usually offer us_our choice_of plain or garlic_naan or_even both
they_are eager_to please their_customers here_at mt_everest
quite often i_can tell when an_indian_restaurant is_going_to_be good by the_number_of indian_people eating_there mt_everest attracts a diverse mix_of clientele
yet does not fall into_the trap of becoming too westernised
if_i have_one small criticism it_is that gulab_jamun
a personal favourite
never seems_to appear as the_dessert on_the_buffet
but this_is_an extremely minor complaint
the_dinner_menu is_extensive with as_many as ten options_for each base type_of food
veg
chicken
lamb etc
at_dinner you_get_a free serve of papadums along_with well_priced servings that_were a_good cheaper than_in some_of_the local competitor restaurants_and possible twice the_size extremely good_value and_the dinner_time butter_chicken could_be the_best_i_have_ever tasted
note
you_might want_to look over_all star reviews_of mount_everest
and for_that matter
all vegas indian_restaurants
with_a critical eye
you'll notice they_are often from people who_have written no other real reviews
i_strongly suspect there's some
review wars
going_on between different establishments
you'll notice they will_always claim that staff_are
rude
disrespectful
etc
there_isn't an indian_restaurant_in_vegas i_have_been_to where the_staff have_been anything short_of gracious to_the_point of humble and mt_everest is no_exception
don't believe_the bogus reviews that claim otherwise
this_is_an extremely good_indian_restaurant
the_chefs certainly know their way around a_spice rack
my_favorite_dish so_far is the_vegetable_korma
i'd suggest ordering a_side_of_garlic naan with_your_meal
since_it's hands_down_the best_naan in_town
i_highly_recommend_this restaurant
fail to understand the_yelp hype here
very standard north_indian restaurant
solid
and_in the_top half_of that category
but_not star by_any stretch
only a_couple_of nepalese dishes
vegetable chow chow was_kind_of lame
just_a_few chopped peppers_and onions
there_are too many_indian_restaurants bringing the_same menu_and they_all blend together
india_is a_huge country
especially when_you're including neighboring countries like nepal
and it_has_a vast variety_of cuisines and styles
somebody please bring something more adventurous than saag_paneer and_chicken_tikka_masala
good solid indian_food
the_lunch_buffet_is an_amazing deal
the_food_is_always made_to_order
dinner_and take_out is_always great
would recommend_this_restaurant to_any one craving_indian_food
don't judge_a book_by it's cover
they_got new windows that_makes them look closed hehe
we love_this_place
great_selection
changes per day
good_thing because_we do come_here consecutively
the_service_is friendly_and_attentive
lunch_buffet
wow
for_the low maintenance diner
i've_been_to mt_everest several_times for_lunch
buffet
and_dinner
and_have_been pleased on each visit
i_had dinner_there about week ago
portions_were large
food_was_good quality
service_was fast_and friendly
overall definitely recommended
don't_let_the location put you_off
i've_been_here over a_dozen times for_both lunch_and_dinner and_have left happy each time
definitely try_the buffet_for_lunch
food_is hot
fresh
and_tasty
you_get both plain and_garlic_naan as part_of_the_meal
all_for
dinner_is great_as_well
lamb_and_chicken dishes_were quite_tasty
the_only dish which_has disappointed was the_tandori which_was flavorful_but overcooked_and dry
i've tried_it twice with the_same result so_i'm sticking with the_curries
this_place hits_the spots and location is_a_little dirty looking on_the_outside
but inside clean_and totally different atmosphere
they impressed my_friend that they_use real table clothes at_lunch
it_is off_the_strip
no casino buffet_line here
prices_are great_and food_is_tasty too
if_you_have few friends get the_coupon on_their web site to_get_a discount
lunch was hot_and_fresh
and_we_got garlic and_plain_naan
with our_meal
oh yummy
and you_have_to splurge and_get the_mango_lassi again yummy
i had_dinner_here tonight
it_was my_first_visit
i_had_the_lamb saag_and an_order_of garlic_naan
i_really_enjoyed my_meal
i_asked_for it_to_be spicy
it_was_a_little mild for_me
but_it_was_still very_good
i'll be_back_to_try the_lunch_buffet to_get_a mix_of their_food
a luncheon with my_fellow yelpers
misti y
and blair t
at_mt
everest india's_cuisine was_just delightful
this_indian canteen is_clean
but small
the variety_of_food choice was short
but it_was_good
they_had cuisine choice_for predators and plant eaters
my_favorite is_their nan basket that they_brought_out from_the back
which_is delivered to_your_table as you_sit down_with your_food
i_like_this concept because some indian_buffets will_have the_nan sitting on_the_buffet to_be grabbed individually
the mt_everest way
keeps the_nan fresh_and savory by delivery
the_big plus is_that_they offer a_coupon to purchase buffets_and get free
which_is good until may
you_can redeem this online http

i_will_be_coming back_and especially being located close_to_my office
i_had_a fabulous lunch_here with yelp's misti and honey
i'm_not an_indian_food expert i'd defer you_to misti's review if you're looking_for technical insight on the_food_quality
overall i_was_quite impressed
this will_be my_new go_to_indian food buffet spot for_lunch
with coupon
is_definitely_a great_price for_the_quality level
as the_other ladies mentioned the_naan basket is out_of_this_world
garlic_and plain
yes please
i_might have_eaten like half_the basket sorry girls
i_should also mention despite_the location and_the shady looking exterior
the inside_is neat and_clean and_very spruced up
don't_let_the location scare you this_place is_worth_the investment
a_great steal for_lunch_buffet
person
gets you fresh_garlic butter nan_bread
every item in_the_menu was_great
with a_great_selection from about items on_the_table
ample parking space about miles from strip
my_fav lunch destination in_vegas
had_the_buffet and_it_was among the_best_indian buffets_i've ever_had
and_i try_to test them_all out
the service_was_a_bit strained
because there_was_only one_person doing everything
being a_buffet
that didn't_really matter too_much
but a_little_more attentiveness would_have_been nice
i_saw a_review about_it being too cold
but when_we_went
it_was super hot_and humid in_the_restaurant
so_much_that we_wanted_to hurry and get_out
if it_is like_that every_time
it will_definitely put me_off of_going in_the_future
edit
i've been_back for_the_buffet probably times_since this initial review and things have_been great ever_since
i'm upgrading to stars
i loooove this_place
veggie_options are_very_good here
i_love_the basmati_rice
it_is cooked_to_perfection
i_have_been_here many_times and_they_have different options_in veggie_dishes
my_last_visit they_had an_excellent cabbage dish which_was sauteed in yummy herbs and_spices
curry
makes the_world go around
the_world go around
the_world go around
curry
makes the_world go around
it_makes the_world go 'round
money
from cabaret
with_some slight changes
there's_a reason indian_restaurant lunch_buffets are_so popular all the_curry you_can_eat and_lots_of varieties
mt_everest knows it_and does a great_job with_its buffet
options of_vegetarian curry
lamb_curry
chicken_curry anchor the_buffet offerings and_they_are all tasty
although a_little lacking_in spice
those looking_to set_the
roof
of_their mouth
on fire
will be_a_little disappointed
what makes mt everest's buffet exceptional are_the additional offerings delicious samosas
sweet sticky rice
soft basmati_rice_and free
warm
garlic_naan on_the_table
all_of which_makes this the_best indian_buffet_in_town
outstanding
my_favorite indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
very_busy during_the lunchtime buffet
evening dinners are_more relaxed and_comfortable
what's up_with me
indian_buffets_in days
that must_be a first for_me
i_don't_think i've_been_to one for six months prior_to this
my craving_for the_indian buffet_had not_been satiated by_my visit_to mint_and so_i_was determined to_have a_good_experience today
after extensive research on_yelp i_decided_to_try mt
everest
a co_worker of_mine agreed to join me
ditching his diet
thanks_to the_fact_that shari s had described the_naans here_as being
billowy
we_made the_long mile trudge to mt_everest from_the office
this buffet_is seriously amazing
for a_little tiny place charging
per_person
it seriously hit every craving and made_us happy campers
there_is_an extensive vegetarian selection in_the_buffet
soft basmati_rice with_peas
palak_paneer
punjabi kadi
malai_kofta
dhal
cauliflower and_potato stirfry
sambar
idly
samosas
pakoras and_a myriad of_chutneys
yogurt
salad_and dips
i_have_only good_things to say_about every single dish on_the_buffet
tasted good_and_the ingredients were_all fresh
indian_buffets frequently omit primo dishes like paneer
indian cottage_cheese cubes
kofta
indian dumplings in gravy
samosas_and fresh
not frozen
veggies in their_food
mt
everest did no such thing
they spared no expense and_made this_buffet experience fantastic
my co_worker who eats meat couldn't_stop raving about the_creamy chicken_makhani
lamb_curry and the_samosas
he went pretty crazy with_all_the chutneys
and_yes
the_garlic naans that_came_with the_buffet
we_asked_for garlic
were billowy
and_extremely tasty
my_only gripe with mt
everest_is the_dessert selection
they_had sweet_rice
which really is_a cop out dessert
but_i settled for_their fresh fruit selection
oranges and watermelon
i_would_give these_guys a
stars
taking off a_half star_for_the dessert
but_since i_can't on_yelp
they_get a four
next_time
if they_serve gulab_jamun i_will_be more_than happy_to up it to_a no questions asked star_review
it's truly heartwarming to_see an_indian_buffet keep it's quality consistent even_after being open a_while
mt
everest really did warm my_heart and_brought back some_of_my lost hope in_the indian_buffet genre in_las_vegas
thanks to_all_the yelpers that_did a_wonderful job describing this_place
you_guys were spot_on
the_buffet_is pretty_good compared_to all_the_other indian_buffet_in_town
but you_really have_to_try some_of_the stuff off_the_menu
the_vindaloo and jalab gamun were excellant
i_also_tried the_chai here
but_it left something more to_be disired
all in_all
its always_a positive experience_here
and_like everyone says
you_have_to try the_garlic_naan_bread
i'm_not down_for indian
but_i gave_it_a try
i unfortunately eat with_my nose
too
and i_cannot stand the_smell_of curry
but_i tried
the plus for_those who don't_like indian_cuisine but are forced to_eat_at an_indian_restaurant is the_naan
eat lots_of it
it's awesome
i_gave a based_on_the bread and_the_lamb
lamb was_good_and not_too overwhelming
ignore my_review
though
it's_not fair because_i'm biased
lunch_buffet_was mediocre
flavors_were good_but meat quality_was below average
service_was average
nothing_special here
as_a kid i_used_to hang out with_a_lot_of guys from sri lanka and malaysia and_this_place reminded me_of_the food they_made
i didn't_look at_the_menu much on_this visit because that buffet called to_me
teasing my nose like_a cartoon depiction of the_smell_of food tickling scooby's nose
the_curry selection here is_fantastic and_so are_all the_other_dishes on_the_buffet
this_is_definitely my_favorite indian_cuisine restaurant now and_i_will come_here anytime my better half lets me lol
i'm_not an_expert_on_indian food
it's probably not_even on_my list_of top cuisines
maybe every or years i'll_have a craving_for_indian_food
i'm more_of_a japanese or thai curry person
after today's meal at mt_everest i_will b eating more indian curries
the_lunch_buffet was_really_good
everything_was hot_and_fresh
the_naan_bread both garlic_and plain was_super
everything_i ate i_enjoyed daal
tandoori chix
some spinach_and cheese dish a_lot_of other foods don't_remember the_names
service_was_attentive and_the_restaurant look alot better inside then out
i_think it_was_a burger_king in it's former life
like_i said not an_expert_on_indian food
but_this_was goooood
there_are already plenty of reviews
so i'll focus on the_korma sauce
it's_a creamy concoction of special magnificence
whenever this_buffet has anything with korma
i_have_to eat_it
the_sauce is rich
slightly spicy
and_quite magical
everything else_is also tasty_and_the bollywood videos are hypnotizing
my only_complaint_is_that on several occasions the_service_has been rather grumpy
a_bit sketchy on_the_outside
and thankfully i_did_not judge the book_by its cover
buffet_had many good options_and was a_steal at only
naan_was among the_best_i had_in_vegas this trip
the_korma sauces_were rich_and flavorful
just_as other yelpers mentioned
i_think_the one i_had_was cheese cubes with_peas
and_it_was quite delectable
this is_by_far_the_best_indian lunch_buffet i_ever_had in_vegas
the_service_was amazing_and restaurant_itself it clean_and quiet
most_indian restaurants' lunch_buffet are dishes from days_ago
at mt_everest i_could really taste the_flavor_of different spices they_use and the_meat_dishes were tender but_not_too soft
the curry_dishes were_just perfect
enough sweetness but_also taste_the kick of_other spices they_use
i truly believe this_place roast their own spices_and grind it_up themselves also
loved_the place
glad_we found_it on_yelp because the_outside isn't very inviting
i'd_definitely pass the_place if_i saw it since it_looks very plain and_the buiding is aging
first
the_price_is great at under for_the_lunch_buffet
the_manager_and staff_were_very nice and_attentive
we_were_seated right away
so_no wait around_pm
i_tried everything
the_chicken_curry
chicken_korma
veggie_korma
palik paneer
dahl
soup
rice_pudding
etc
with_a hot indian chai
the veggie_korma was_very creamy_and seemed even better_than_the chicken
though the_chicken was_really_good
this_isn't diet food and_we_had_a very_light dinner since_we_were full all_day
i_saw some_people get the_buffet_to go
which seemed_like_a good idea
at
you meet or beat the_price_of most_other lunch spots
other stuff
chai_was as it_should_be
nothing super special
but_i'd order again
the_garlic_naan_was different
but_we prefer regular_naan
the_garlic changes the_flavor_of the_food too_much
regardless
it's_nice having warm
fresh_naan brought to_your_table instead_of having it sit on_the_buffet
due_to our complete
total satisfaction
the_price_and friendliness of staff
i'm_giving a rare stars
stars_is really giving the benefit of_the doubt here
i_would_say service_was_a solid stars
although there_was a_bit_of the soft upsell here_on beer_and extra side items like multiple orders_of naan
but food_was stars
stars tops
i_really_like_the strong and bold flavors of_indian_cuisine
and_also the_quality_of_the sauces
which tend to_be_very smooth
with supporting notes of texture like cashew or other_items to provide some 'tooth' to a_dish
i_found_the sauces here to_be_very heavy
a_bit 'gloppy' and_just lacking_in quality the_sauces just weren't inviting to_me
actual taste of_the_sauces was_ok serviceable
but_nothing great
also
lamb was_pretty tough
and_chicken had small bones
the kinds that_should not_be in_a dish
small enough_to catch in one's throat and cartiledge just unappetizing
paneer dish we_had_was one_of_the_better items
but sauce still_had that heavy and unpleasant texture
i_have_not yet found an_indian_restaurant_in vegas_that measures up_to origin india_in its heyday
went here_for_the_lunch_buffet a_couple_of days_ago
it_wasn't_bad
but_it_wasn't my_favourite
i_will
however
come_back_again for_sure in_the near future as i_know_the nature of indian_buffet is_to constantly rotate the types_of food
for_those just trying_out indian for_the_first_time
there will_be at least some thing there you_will like
the_place_was clean
white table cloths and stemmed water goblets on_all the_tables
and_they_are very_attentive to_the used plates_and the empty water
worth_the_price for_sure
wow
i'm_going to_be_the black sheep here and_give this_restaurant only_two stars
when my_husband_and_i entered for_lunch a_few_days ago
the_manager or owner_was talking on_the_phone
we stood by politely waiting
until he pointed us to_sit with_his chin the_phone still strapped to his ear
never once addressing or welcoming us to_sit by words
i_was_surprised
but_didn't say anything
the_restaurant_itself was_really dark inside
there_were_no lights turned on at_all
just_a_little natural light coming_from the_small heavily curtained windows
nice surroundings and kind interactions make food taste better in_my line of thinking
so this_restaurant just failed in these respects
the_buffet itself_was fine
nothing was_amazing nor was_anything bad
after we_sat with our_food
the_same manager brought a_basket_of naan_and actually tossed it_down onto our_table as_he walked by without even making eye contact with_us
still jabbering away on_his phone
my_husband_and_i just looked_at each_other and laughed
it_was_that bizarre
needless_to say
i_will_not_be going back
there_are other_indian_buffets in_town that serve great_food
have_an inviting ambiance_and treat me like_a valued customer
i_visited this_restaurant in june
and_i_had their_lunch_buffet
the_food_was_excellent
and their_prices reasonable for_good indian_cuisine
i_would_definitely_go back_there when_i return_to the vegas_area
o happy days
when on site at_my client in_las_vegas i_cannot_wait for_my lunch break so_i_can jet down to_mt
everest india cuisine for_my much needed indian_food fix
i became aware of_this_place after searching yelp for_an_indian_restaurant and_have_never looked back
the_restaurant_is just a_couple_of minutes away from_my work site so the_lunch_buffet works out really_well
i_can immediately sit down
order my plain naan_bread_and start dishing up
the_food_is_always flavorful and_there_are always very many_options to_choose_from
they_take care_of the_vegetarian and the_meat lovers between us
i take particular joy in the_chana_masala at_this venue a_delight which_is shared by one_of_the waiters who told_me this a_while ago
i_love the_fact_that i_can go_back_to scoop some_more of_any indian_curry with which i_can enjoy_the remainder of_my naan_bread
i_have_ordered a chicken_tikka_masala take_out with mt
everest before_and that sparked off my 'must have' mindset with which_i now approach every trip to_las_vegas
i confess that_i_will easily come_here more_than once per single work week because that_is how_good the_food_is
and_as for_the_price you_will hardly ever convince me_of better value_for_money elsewhere
we_went_here for_dinner about a_month ago
we_had_the samosa chat for an_app
cubed samosa with yogurt and_mint sauce
it_was_good but_i'd probably try something different next_time
seems_like it's made out_of leftover samosas
we also_got raita which_was_good but_a_little tarter than i_like
the_garlic_naan_was yummy
for main_courses we_had prawn biriyani and mateer paneer
the prawn biriyani was_tasty though the_rice_was on_the al dente side
the matter_paneer had_a_nice sauce
the_dinner was_good overall
but there_are_better indian_restaurants_in_town
not an_expert_on_indian cuisine but i_love_this_place
very tasty_food
the_waiter
owner
has always_been very_kind and_has dishes prepared as_i like them
i_never see any crowds here_and never have_seen more_than_a few tables with_people at them
i_don't_know why and_its a_shame
but thumbs_up from_me
i_really hope it stays in business
i've visited other local indian_places
this_one is_by_far my_favorite so_far
really good_quality indian_dishes
especially spicy ones
can_be hard_to find and_they go downhill really fast if_not prepared_with care
i_had never_tried_indian_food before and_there's no better way_to_try it for_the_first_time than to_come_here for_their_lunch_buffet
prices_are_very_reasonable
and the_selection_is pretty extensive
there_were at least different vegetarian currey options_and different meat_options
all the_food_was_very fresh with tons_of flavor
you're instantly smacked in_the face with_all_the different aromas of_the indian_spices as_soon as you_enter the restauarant
the_service_was_also great
my_water_glass never_got more_than half empty before someone was by to_refill it
i_was_very_impressed
i_think my_favorite part_of_the whole experience was_the_naan basket
they_give_you_a basket_of what looks like toasted pita_bread
but_it's so_much_better
it_comes plain_and with garlic_and wow the_garlic_naan_was soo good
i_could probably just sit there and_eat that all_day
overall
this_was_a good first_experience
a_little overwhelming since i_didn't_know what half of_the_food_was
but it_all tasted delicious
today was_my second_visit to_this_restaurant
and_like my_last_visit
i_was thoroughly impressed
the_cost of_the all_you_can_eat buffet_is
and_it's worth_every_penny
i'd_be willing to_be a_couple_of dollars more
it_would still be an_excellent deal
the decor_is_nice
nothing_special
but_it's white table cloth and_clean
the_service_and attention that your given is_excellent
the_food_is absolutely fabulouso
the_lamb will melt in_your_mouth
the curried dishes_are absolutely_delicious and_there_is_a great_deal of_variety so_if your a_vegetarian you'll be very_happy
the_food_is hot_and very_fresh_and naan_bread_was quite_tasty
i'll be_going back to_this_restaurant again and_again
i_came_here_with my_husband about an_hour before closing time
i_don't usually like going_to restaurants last minute but i_have_been craving_indian_food for awhile
i really_wanted to_try a_lamb_dish even though i've never been a_big_fan_of it in_the_past
i've_always thought the_taste_of lamb had_a weird after taste
i_tried_the lamb vindoolo
which_is cooked_with potatoes_and chilly sauce
the_lamb_was_tender and surprisingly no weird after taste
it_was_really_good
i_also_had a_mango_lassi that was_super delicious
i'm glad it_came in_a clean glass because at bollywood they gave_me_a glass with a_whole bunch_of fingerprints all_over it
that_was_a turn off
my_husband_had a_salad with_garlic_naan
the_salad tasted_great with_the_naan but too sour without_it
the_naan came out hot_and had_a_nice garlicky taste to_it
we didn't_feel rushed even_though_we came_in an_hour before closing time
the_service_is attentive
quick
and_friendly
buffet doesn't look_like it_will_be tasty_but all_of_it is_very_good
plus the_garlic_nan bread_is the bomb
i_found great review from fellow yelpers about this_restaurant but_never gotten a_chance to_try_it_out until last_week
wow
i'm glad_i_did
i_have lived in_vegas_for half_a decade already and this_is_by_far the_best_indian_buffet restaurant_in_vegas
the_price_is reasonable
but_the_food_is what made them apart from other_indian_places
the_tandoori_chicken_was flavorful_and moist
other_places tends_to have dried out chicken
and the_curries_were awesome
they removed the_bone from_the chicken_and_lamb curries so_it_was so_much easier to_eat_and not bite into one of_those small bones
so many_other varieties
so little time_and stomache space
i_wish_they were closer_to where i_live
the_service_was alright
we_couldn't understand what one_of_the waiters was saying but_he main guy_was super_nice
we_waited_for about min for_the_food_to arrive
i_had_the lamb_korma_and my_husband_had lamb vindoolo and we_shared some traditional and garlin naan_bread with a_cup_of chai
the_spice was_perfect
my_husband_had_the hot and_i has medium
hot enough_for him and just_a_little kick for_me
perfect d i'd come_back_again in_a heart beat
according_to my_indian roommate
this_place_is ok
however
when_she is comparing the_food_to her mom's home cooking
that means the place_is_pretty legit
we_stopped by to_check_out_the lunch_buffet
you can't_really beat it_for
lots_of food
plenty of_curries
veggie
chicken
lamb
samosas
buttered chicken
etc
the_naan was_really_good
they_brought it_out piping_hot from_the_kitchen
i'm not_the_best person to_ask about_indian_food
but_i_thought it_was_good
so_i would def come_back
went_to mt_everest again last_week and noticed_that some items_were changed
so_i'm_not sure_if they_have different_items each day or_not
no goat_curry
bummer
anyway
the_food were not_as_good_as the_last_time_i tried_it
i_mean
it's not_bad
it's_just_not as_good to_be rated stars
anyway
last_week experience deserved only star
so_i kinda averaged it out_to_be star
great local place off_the_strip for_indian_food buffett
have_been twice_and love_it
i_used_to come_to this building all_the_time
when it_was_a burger_king
this_was my_first_visit since mt
everest took_over
i went_for_the_lunch_buffet
the selections were somewhat limited
but the_food_was_pretty_good
they_bring naan to_the_table
those who have_eaten_at other_indian_buffets know that_this_is a_nice_touch
because it_seems that_you always have_to_wait and fight for_the_naan if it_is on_the_buffet_line
the workers were_friendly and_efficient with water refills and plate removal
strangely though
they_did_not come to_refill the soft_drinks
like_i said
this used_to_be_a burger_king
with that_being considered
the_decor_was nice
the_white tablecloths are a_nice_touch
the_parking situation can_be_a_bit dicey as_it_is located in_front_of a_busy market
i_love_indian_food but_we usually_go to_india_palace so_when i_got_a off coupon
we_decided_to_try them_out
i_am_so glad_we did
their_prices seem_to be slightly lower than india_palace and_their portions_were definitely much larger
we_had_the vegetable_samosa to_start it was_a_tad salty but_with the_two chutneys
they_really balanced out
we_also_had
chili naan_was_good
not spicy_at_all
chicken_tikka same_as tandoori_chicken but boneless
it_was_good
some pieces were_a_little dry but_overall pretty_good
i_don't understand the french fries on top though
that kinda threw me_off
hmmm
lamb_vindaloo delish
lamb were actual pieces_of lamb
not_the ground lamb like_some places use
very_flavorful
not_too gamey
aloo matter potatoes_and peas in_a sauce
again
large portion and large chunks_of potatoes
overall everything_was excellent
medium_spice still gave all the_entrees a_little kick
i_just asked_for hot_sauce on_the side to_add to_my food_since i_really_like it_spicy
will_definitely be_back
next_time with my_daughter as_i know she will really enjoy_it
no butter_chicken on_the_menu but think i'll_try the_chicken_korma next
stopped by_this unassuming little indian_joint before going_to a show a_while ago and_i_found it_to_be a_great_find
the_restaurant_is actually an_old burger_king
but the_decor inside hides its tragic past
the_food_was well_made and_came out_quickly
the_service_was_great
the_waiter_was attentive but_never hovered
he even made_sure my_table knew_we ordered both vegetarian_and meaty dishes so as to_avoid confusion
i_would_recommend_this_place and happily go_back again
we_received pappadum plus delicious tamarind and_mint sauces to begin our_meal and_after an exceptionally long_wait we_received our aloo tiki
deep_fried mashed potatoes
which_were overdone and virtually inedible
a_few_minutes later the remainder of_our_meal
chicken makahani
lamb_saag
plain basmati_rice_and kabuli naan
stuffed_with raisins_and nuts
appeared
the_naan_was flat as_a pancake and_the filling was very_bland
both entrees_were large_and delicious though the_lamb was_on_the tough side
we concluded the_meal with_a shared portion_of carrot_halwa which was_a_bit too_sweet
service
other then by_the busboy
was abysmal from start to_finish
the sole waiter
i_am guessing the_owner
sat in_a booth across_the room from us playing with_a cell phone and_never once looked in_our direction to determine if_we or_any of_the_other diners needed anything
i_had_to call_the busboy over to_get_our check and_then it_took the_waiter an inordinate amount of time_to process the payment
i have_been_going here_with_my bangladeshi friend_for over_a_year
i_found_it while going shopping at_the mexican market next door
didn't buy anything
kinda crappy selection
but_i_was looking_for_a horchata
anyway
it_is_not a large_selection for_a_buffet
but the_items that_they_have are_very_good
there_is half for_vegetarians and half for meat_eaters
i usually_get a_lot_of_the tandori chicken_and_lamb with curry
their dessert rice_pudding of some_sort is_pretty dang good_too
i_think it_is_a staple of most_indian_restaurants but_they do_it well here
i_usually grab co_workers and use buy get free coupon and pig out once per month during_lunch hours
dinner_is the_same but_they dont have_the_buffet
the_place_is_clean and_the nan_bread comes_out hot
i_told my_friends this_was_a hole in_the_wall
and_it_is on_the_outside
but inside_is tastefully done
on_the_wall is_the obligatory indian dramas who dance away the_whole time_you are eating
read_the_reviews and_wanted_to give_this_place_a try
bonus this_restaurant_is on restaurant
com
located_in_a seedy area_of town but_very welcoming inside
first_thing we_ordered_was the_lamb samosa_and was_disappointed
way salty
but the_garlic_naan_and chicken_tandoori was_yummy
learned something new though
one_of_my favs 'butter chicken' is called chicken_makhani
up until now_i never_really liked indian_food
especially a_buffet
everything just seemed soggy
overcooked_and old
this_restaurant however
is completely the_opposite of_my preconceived notion
we went_for_the_lunch_buffet
it_was_amazing
everything_was fresh_and_hot
a_very_good selection_of both vegetarian and_meat_dishes
most everything_i tried was_absolutely_delicious
i_went_back for_seconds and_even thirds
the_next_day
i came_back for_more
the_restaurant_was clean
the_decor tasteful and_comfortable
the_price_was very_good too
careful though
all_that curry can_get to_you
this_was our_first_visit to_mt
everest
and we_went_for_dinner
the_ambience was_perfectly okay
not fancy
just_a typically decorated indian_restaurant with decent lighting
meaning it_wasn't_too bright
initially
i_was put_off by_the young guy_who came to_take_our drink_orders
he_was asian
but not_indian
and_i_could barely understand a_word he_was saying
i_thought he might be nepalese
and_it turned_out i_was right
i_don't_think he's been_in the_desert long enough to_be dealing with customers
since his english was unintelligible
but by_the_time he_took our_food orders
i'd caught onto his rhythm enough_to understand and_be understood
and_by golly
he_got the_order right
i_was happy_to_see three different thalis on_the_menu
i_like being able to_taste a_little_of everything
we_ordered_the special mt
everest thali_and also_a vegetable_biryani
almost_everything on the_thali was terrific
the_appetizer plate came_with one very large veggie_samosa
a_bunch_of very_small pakoras
some pieces_of ground mean whose name i_can't_remember
and boneless tandoori_chicken
we_were full before the_main event
then came the_thali platter
on_a thali
the_dessert is_right there on_the platter
along_with_the food
it was_supposed_to_be gulab_jamun
which is_not_a favorite
but instead
there_was kheer the_rice_pudding and_it_was the_most watery kheer i'd ever_tried
we asked_if_we could_have kulfi instead
and_were cheerily obliged
the_only_other problem_with the_meal_was the_raita
every indian_restaurant makes_it differently
but this_one_was special
especially awful
it_was watery
tasted a_bit sweet
and_just downright peculiar
nevertheless
we packed it_up along_with our other leftovers
when_we opened the container the_next night it_was fizzy
it_got the boot immediately
the_biryani was_a_huge portion_of rice
it_was well_cooked and_tasty
but not_much in_the way_of veggies
which_made it a_big disappointment
overall
we_enjoyed the_meal_and definitely will_return
but i_don't_know_what we'll do for raita
love_this_place
i_make excuses to_be on_that side_of_town mid day so_i_can do the_lunch_buffet
delicious
wish_i didn't_get full so quickly
went the_first_time with_a visiting friend
we_had_the big sampler deal took home two styro containers
it_was even delicious cold the_next_day
indian_cuisine_is not for_everyone but_if_you like_it you'll love mt
everest
this_place may_have tasty indian_food_but somehow i_felt bloated all_day after eating_here
maybe because_of baking soda in_the bread
i_remember hostel messes in_india doing that to_keep people from eating too_much
i_agree_with some_of_the reviewers here_that the_owner waiter needs_to have_an attitude makeover
he scowls if people ask_for another round of nans
thankfully his cellphone did_not go off while_we_were there
and_rice_pudding as_a desert
i_can't_remember when a_indian resturant got away with pulling that stunt off
india has so_many wonderful deserts and surely rice_pudding is somewhere down at the_bottom of_that list
if_you_have to eat_indian in_lv
maybe this_would_be my recommendation just_because others are worse
mint ok
origin terrible
i_guess it's_not fair for_me_to review this_place while_i didn't_get there until the_last minute of lunch_buffet
i_was actually surprised they let us_in
food_was old_and dried by then
but_they sure tasted_great
next_time
i'll come earlier
we spotted when_we_were just driving by on_the_way to church
we decided_that we'd give_it_a try on our_way back
the exterior doesn't shout yummy indian_food
but the_interior was_nice_and clean
i_always check the restroom to_see_how well it_is maintained before dining somewhere
it_also was_quite clean
there_are booths against the_walls windows with round tables in_the center
there_were several families and_a_few couples dining
what_i really noticed was_that everyone seemed_to be having a_good_time and_the conversations from_the other_tables could_not be heard from_where we_were sitting
i_thought_that was_a plus because_you could_have a private conversation or laugh at jokes without disturbing anyone else
they_did an_excellent job at seating their_customers throughout_the restaurant
all in_all
we_were impressed_with_the quality
portions_and price of_the_food
for_starters
you_get_a basket_of papadum with_two little dipping_sauces
we_ordered lamb_vindaloo
classic spicy lamb w potatoes
chicken jel frenzi
chicken_with bell pepper
onions
mushrooms in sauce
aloo kauli
potatoes cauliflower
and two_orders_of naan
garlic keema lamb
the_dishes had wonderful sauces with excellent consistency for sopping up_with naan
everything_was fresh
hot_and yummy
the_service_was_good
the_waiter never let our_water_glasses get empty
and the_food_came_out as ordered in_a timely manner
i_will_definitely put mt
everest at the_top_of my_list for non franchised indian dining
great_atmosphere and_even better_food
i_am_not experienced in indian_cuisine
this_was_my st experience
i had_the_lunch_buffet so_i_could try a_little_of everything
the lamb_and_chicken were moist_and tender
and_everything_was very_flavorful
the_lunch_buffet_is a_steal at
i_was overly impressed_by everything at_this_restaurant
wow
i like_indian_food
but_i_am very_picky with_it and_only have_made a_few_dishes at_home which_i like
my_sister and i_walked over here while_i_was getting my windows tinted a_few_weeks_ago and man was_i impressed
very_much so
i_have_never_been a_fan_of lamb
but_their lamb_curry was_to_die_for
everything_i put on_my_plate was_absolutely phenomenal
and the_sweet_rice
oh the_sweet_rice
i_would live on_that stuff forever
the_service_was fantastic
and they_were_very concerned that we_enjoyed everything
the_naan_was fresh_and_delicious
i_ate two plates full until i_was ready_to burst
i_have decided i_love_indian_food
and_am so_happy because_i_was always thinking i_wasn't so big on_it
i_cannot recommend_this_place enough
absolutely_delicious
i went_here_for lunch_buffet_and think that_its an an ok for an_indian_lunch
its_not over the_top but_its not_bad either
very_limited items
tandoori_chicken a_little_too dry
the_lamb meat was_good
chicken was_good_and thanks for_the_naan that cooked fresh
i'm not_a_huge_fan of_indian_food
but_this_place was_pretty_good
lunch_buffet_was only
great_price for_indian_food and_they_had an array_of different_dishes
i_really_liked_the sweet_rice
i've_never_had that before at_an_indian_restaurant
great_place if_you_like_indian_food
the_bf and i_came_in and_we_were sat down immediately with_some ice water_and papadams with chutney as_we browsed the_menu
we_decided to_get_the
mt_everest special
which_comes with
mixed appetizer
salad
papadam
chicken_tikka
dal_makhani
palak_paneer
lamb_curry
chicken_tikka
rice
naan
raita
for_dessert gulab_jamun and chai_tea
we_did_not really get what_was on_the_menu as_we didn't_get salad or our dessert but kheer rice_pudding instead
i_didn't realize this until looking_at_the online menu_for this_review
either way it's alot_of food_but would_have_been nice to_get what we_ordered
the mix appetizer was_some grilled sausage
chicken_tikka pieces
a_samosa and little papadam bites
it_was_a_very big plate_and was_super filling
the_main_dishes were decent with the_paneer being my_favorite
my one_thing was_that_the paneer_and the_dal needed a_bit_of salt
but_still_good
raita was_more tangy and watery than_most i've_had
but was_good to_dip my_naan in
the_kheer was_very_nice_and not_too_sweet
chicken_korma
entrees come with_rice
it_was decent
but was_more yellow curry flavor than_other kormas i've_had
we also_got some_garlic_naan
thinking that_there might_not be enough naan_with the_mixed plate but_if we_didn't order this the plain_naan would_be more_than enough
the_amount_of_food for_two_people with that_is crazy
we had_leftovers which_i had for_two separate and_still very sizable lunches
we would_have_been very full_and satisfied with_just_the mixed plate
but_we_had a_restaurant
com certificate to_use
service_was okay
they started_off good_with drink refills when_they came_to drop off food
after_a while_they were_doing tasks and_seemed to_be really into_it towards of_our_meal so we_sat there for_a_while needing things
overall
the_food_here isn't my_favorite_indian but decent
it_definitely is the_most value large_portions than_any others i've_been_to
i_was_surprised
driven by this_place countless number_of times_but never ventured in seeing as_it used_to_be_a burger_king back_in the_day
the food_was_tasty
tried them_out via a_groupon now
the cashier didn't know anything about the_groupon which_was a_little_bit_of a turn off cause i_felt guilty trying to_use_it but_they honored it anway for_takeout service
had_the_chicken briyani and_the_chicken jalfrezi
i_think_the briyani could_have used for_chicken but it_wasn't_bad
the jalfrezi was not_bad either
i_love spicy_and i_miss the_one restaurant_in los angeles
closed recently
that used to_make_the best chicken_vindaloo
while_in vegas_i discovered_this_place and i'm_so looking_forward_to my_next_visit
awesome_food
super delicious
wish_they moved_to los angeles
op
i_took_my family here to_eat for_an dinner_at
pm
since_we purchased a_restaurant
com certificate
it may_have the_old structure of_the burger_king
but it's_a_nice and_relaxing atmosphere where they_don't rush you
i was_impressed_with their_tandoori oven chicken
it_was_very_good portion
i've ate_at some_other places_like san_francisco where they_don't give_you too_much meat_on the_chicken
but_this_place in_vegas is_really_good
to_tell if an_indian_restaurant is any good is if_they can't make the_most common
typical naan_and chicken_tikki_masala taste good_that indian_restaurants_are famous for
then_i advise you run away_and head for_the hills
but seriously
their onion_naan was_good_and tasty
everything we_ordered was_good_and we_will_definitely go_back
i_was_looking_for indian take_out so i_went_to yelp
this_place_is out_of_my way
but_i_thought i_would check_it_out
i_am glad that_i_did
i_called ahead_and ordered_take_out
minutes later when_i_arrived it_was_not ready
it_took almost more minutes
ok
now_i know
so_that is_fine
i_ordered_the lamb_korma_and garlic_naan
woah
portions_are for sharing
i saved some for the_next_day and_it_was even_better
the_large chunks_of lamb
which i_had_to cut in half
were tender_and tasty
the_sauce made_me realize how_much i missed indian_food
the jasmine rice was_perfectly done
the_garlic_naan delicious
i_saw there_is_a lunch_buffet_and plenty of seating
maybe another day i will_do the_lunch_buffet
thanks_to everyone who yelped on this_spot
i_found a_new_indian take_out spot
after misti y
suggested mt
everest to_me
i_had_to stop_by to_try_out their
lunch_buffet
i_had such_a pleasant experience_here
i dined solo and arrived around
pm
buffet ends at pm
the_food_was still hot delicious
the_rice_was still soft
and it_wasn't_too loud or too_busy
the_server and the_manager were_so incredibly polite
they periodically checked_on me to_make_sure everything_was to my_liking and my_water cup was_always filled to_the brim
the_food_was_awesome
a_variety_of lamb_and_chicken curry
a_few vegetarian_options
the_samosas_were on_the salty side but_still incredibly delicious
they_had plain_rice and_a bright orange sweet_rice which was_awesome but_i preferred to_eat the plain_rice with_all_the sauces_and meats
the_naan_was fluffy_and as delicious can_be
i managed_to scarf down a_whole basked by myself
next_time i'll be asking to_try_the garlic_naan too
i_saw a_table next_to me order it_and_it looked awesome
the_food speaks for itself but_the_service is_what will keep_me coming back
two thumbs_up
i ws in_vegas_for the_weekend
and was_craving_indian_food
so_we_decided_to go_here based on_yelp suggestions
we_went for_lunch_and had_the_buffet the_food_was nice
decent
nothing extraordinary but not_bad at_all
overall decent place
the_service_is_good
another lunch favorite
i've been several_times for_lunch
and_always eat at_the_buffet
the_food_is_delicious
there's various traditional options
including basmati_rice
samosas
chicken_dishes
e
g
chicken_tikka
dal_makhani
and_other vegetarian_dishes
there's_also fruit
the_buffet actually has_a_good variety_of_food
my absolute favorite_is_the sweet_rice
which_is orange colored and_has peanuts
or cashews
in_it
i_have_a sweet tooth and_love rice
so this_is_the_best of_both worlds for_me
i'm not_a_huge meat_eater
but am_not vegetarian either so_i end_up loading up_on the_sweet_rice
my runner up favorite
or actually maybe tied
is the_naan
whoa nelly
the_naan_is always warm_and soft
we always_get a_basket that_has plain_naan and_naan with_garlic
the_garlic_naan_is super good
although i'm_sure it's a_huge faux pas
i_love getting_the orange marmalade from_the_buffet
for_the fruit
and putting just a_little_on_the naan
that's my dirty little secret at_mt
everest
overall
it's a_great_place_to have lunch
it's generally busy or_at least half way full
i_think_it also feels a_little nicer because the_tables in_the center of_the_restaurant have linen table cloths
oh
and_another plus they_usually have_a bollywood movie playing on_a flat screen tv above the_buffet
the sound is_not on or is low
but_it's fun to_watch nevertheless
tried_their lunch_buffet_and it_was_good for_most part
they_had_a big selection_of veg and_meat_dishes and_also a_south_indian sambar and idli option
the_place_was very_busy and_it_took about min
after we_had served ourselves to_get_a naan
the_good items_on_the_menu were
kheer
rice_pudding
amazing
samosa nicely seasoned_and not_greasy at_all
butter_chicken very_good
roghan josh
lamb
very_good
the not so_good
dal_makhani dal was_not cooked completely and_was tooooo salty
kadhi it_was made very_well but toooooo salty again
pakora dry_and hard
white_rice dried out
since they_were_busy
it_was_very difficult for_us to_get_the attention of the_server
who_was the_only_one doubling as_the cashier as_well
we_gave up_and didn't_get a_second naan
it_also took_forever_to get the_bill so we_finally walked up_and paid at the_register
it_may be_a_good idea to_get more help on_the_weekends
we_had lunch today at mt_everest india's_cuisine with_an out_of_town guest
we_have_been there_before
but_we feel this_is_the very best_indian_restaurant_in the
las_vegas area_and beyond
all_the_food on_the_buffet was_outstanding
we especially love_the spinach_and lamb_and_chicken curry
we_had_some
special indian hot tea for_our digestion after the_meal
the_two kinds_of naan
was_awesome
the_owner_is extremely pleasant_and made_us_feel welcome
our guest was_impressed_with the variety_of_food on_the_buffet and remarked
that_everything she tried was_delicious
the_service_was outstanding and the_value of_the_meal was_incredible
i_can't
say_enough good_things about this_restaurant_and recommend_it very highly
was_a_very good_experience
the_owner literally ran to the_kitchen when_i ran out_of water_and was_very_attentive to_us
i_had lamb_curry and_it_was_very_good
although i_ordered_it a_little_too spicy
will_definitely go_again
this_has become our regular indian place_to_eat
great_food
great_prices and_friendly_service
the_food can tend to_come_out a_little_spicy
so_if_you normally order say a at other_restaurants
it's safer to_go_with a
we_eat here_every couple_of_weeks and_always bring friends_and family
mt
everest_is a_great_find and_we_were really impressed_with_the caring service_from prakass and_food
we_had chicken_tikka_masala
fabulous
we_were_eating the_sauce by itself when the_chicken_was gone
rogan_josh
lamb
was_tender_and no fat
the_naan_bread_was fluffy_and crispy
i'm_not_a beer drinker but our_server prakass suggested that_we try_the indian_beer
taj_mahal
loved_it
the_food portions_are generous as_well
will_definitely return

i tell my_server owner guy
no problem
he_took it away_and brought_it back re done at_a more acceptable spiceness
i'm pretty_sure that's_not a_word
sorry
delicious
served with_rice_and_a garlic_naan
wifee has chicken_saag
she ordered on the_heat scale
perfect
water_was always topped up
drinks were_offered frequently
really_great and_we_are going back
often
thanks yuhi k
by far
my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in vegas
i originally found_out about_them through groupon
i_stopped by while in_the_area for_take_out
my_go_to dish_is often chicken_makhani
heat
but the_second_time i_decided_to opt for_a dish_that wasn't_so heavy and_the_waiter recommended the_lamb_curry
the_lamb was_cooked_to_perfection
lamb that is_not cooked correctly is tough and gamey
the_portions_are generous_and the_price_is more_than reasonable
i_will continue_to go_out_of my_way for mt
everest
yet again a_great_meal here
we eat_here a_couple_of_times a_month and_the_food remains fabulous
it's_nice to_see_the place getting busier as_well
have_eaten the_lunch_buffet here_at_least times over_the course_of years
and_i_must_say that mt
everest_is finally in it's prime
i immediately sensed a_new chef visits ago
and_my guess was confirmed by the_owner
the_owner_was visibly excited_about the_new chef's contributions
smiling and describing all_of_the new_dishes
tastewise and lookswise
the_buffet has_never been_better
it costs more_than before
but_it_is worth_it
the_sambar soup is perfectly seasoned
the new_dishes
chicken chili
vegetable_korma
are colorful and_tasty
and_the overall spice_level is kicked up one notch closer_to a straight up medium
the_chicken mahkani is masterful and complex as_good as_some of_the_best chicken_tikka_masala type curry i've tasted
the_dal mahkani is_a or bean variety_and is_much improved over the_previous chef's version
great samosas_and aloo vegetable varieties
very importantly
the_buffet console is boiling hot so all_of_the_food is steaming hot_and remains hot on your_plate several minutes_after you_sit down at your_table
this_is_a huge detail that can_make or break an_indian_buffet
mt
everest nails it keep_it up
business seems better_than ever
which_is a_good_sign that i'm_not the_only_one who feels_like this food_has gotten really_good
typical to an_indian_lunch_buffet
the_fresh baked naan_and roti are complimentary
but_the whole_wheat roti is especially good_here one would_expect it to_come_out traditionally thin_and flat
but the_mt
everest version can_be mistaken for_a puffy naan_bread a_nice surprise
whole_wheat roti has taken the_place of_white basmati_rice in_my indian_lunch diet
buffet plates_and bowls are clean_and shiny
water_glasses are refilled constantly
every single visit
finished plates are picked up quickly
overall service_is_great
my_only warning is you_may smell like_indian_food for the_rest_of_the afternoon
so if_you_are on_your way_to an important meeting in_a_small office space
maybe bring a_change of clothing if_you_are self conscious about_that kind of thing
i_guess this_is proof that_when you_eat the_lunch_buffet at_mt
everest
you_are immersed in_a cauldron of_indian deliciousness
go now_and get_it while it's hot
i've waited this long to_write a_review because if_i really care_about a_place_i want to_make_sure it's_right before friends go try_it for_the_first_time
see my cravin' cajun review
the_very best_indian_lunch_buffet in_town
i literally enjoy every hot dish they_offer and_i'm glad they're still doing brisk business
stand outs for_me include the_korma
saag_paneer
chicken_tandoori and the_chana_masala
how do people operate after stuffing their faces here_for_lunch
i_only go_on my days off since_i'm in_a coma for_at least a_couple_of hours after
went_there for_a_lunch_buffet and_was greeted by a_very_nice gentleman
for_the_buffet they had_a_few chicken_dishes as_well as lentils
samosas
saag_paneer sweet_rice and regular basmati_rice
chicken was_spicy_and flavorful_but nothing too crazy since_it_was covered_in chili peppers
the_chicken tandori was_good_but a_little_on_the dry side
the_chicken makahni was_very_flavorful and wasn't_too creamy
their masala_chai was_very_good_and nan_bread was_excellent
i_was_a_little disappointed_in the_saag panner because there_was_a lack_of paneer i_had scoops of_it and_only managed_to get small pieces
but good_thing they_didn't overload it_with heavy cream though
for_dessert they_had watermelon
oranges and_rice_pudding
i_had_the rice_pudding_and it was_on_the thick side
aside from the_lack_of panner and tandori_chicken this_place_is_good and_i_will_be going back
i'm a_simple man
you serve butter_chicken on_your menu_and it_doesn't suck
instant fan
actually
their murgh makhani is_as_good_as anywhere i've ever_had it
i_ate the_whole thing
not_sure what else i_need_to say on_the matter
my_wife_and_i went last_night
this now is
by far
our_favorite_indian joint
amazing
i_was wary of_indian buffet_style but_this_was a_good_choice
good_service
good_variety
tandoori_chicken
the_paneer
and masala were_good enought that i'll be_going back
the_food_here_is delicious
flavorful_and colorful
this nice indian_buffet on_the corner_of valley view and sahara costs
and it's_worth_it
the_restaurant_has_a nice elegant setting as_well
super yummy foods and_a_great buffet selection_for veg heads like_me
the_mango_lassi was_one_of_the_best i've_had_in_a while
nice friendly_service and good_food makes_me a_fan
the_staff here is_very_nice
i_came_to expect much less from indian_pakistani restaurants
they understand the meaning of hospitality and the_food_is_outstanding
try_the_chicken or fish tikka_marsala with_garlic_naan
snagged an online deal for_this_place after_i heard_about it_from friends
it was_really_great
the_portions_were generous
the_prices_were reasonable and_the_staff_was very_kind
they_don't_have a_full_bar here though
so plan accordingly
a_few friends_and_i visited mt
everest india's_cuisine and_we_all agreed that we_enjoyed this_place a_lot
the_service_was_very_good we_felt neither rushed nor neglected
the_owner_is good_at guiding hesitant diners to_the type_of dish he feels each would appreciate
we had_a_lot_of fun sharing different_dishes all were_delicious
definitely a_place_to return_to
delicious lunch_buffet_for bucks
good_variety and fresh_food
i will_return
excellent
i_knew i_was_in_the right place_when i_saw paneer pakoras on_the_menu
mango lassies smooth as silk
its hard for_me_to rate any_indian_restaurant at stars_because no_one will_ever compare_to some homecooked meals by my_mom
but_that being_said this_food was_rather tasty
they_used an appropriate blend_of_spices that weren't overpoweringly spicy
for_an_indian person i_don't do as_well with spicy_food as_one might expect
this was_a_great balance_of flavor amidst the kick in_my_mouth
i_did ask_for mild
i_came_here for_dinner_and not_going_to lie was_a_little turned off_by the_outside
very seedy looking place
then_i stepped inside and_saw that_it_was decorated in_a comfortable manner
clean and_efficient enough
at least for appearence's sake
they_brought_out some papadum and_a_couple sauces to_go_with it
i_ordered_the shahi_paneer which_was_good
not the_best_i've_ever_had but again i'm partial to homecookin
one little complaint i_had_was that i_needed to_ask_for water a_couple_times as i_tend_to drink a_lot_of it while_eating
this_is usually_a given at higher end places
but_as there_was_only two people_working and_it_was rather busy i'll give them benefit of_the doubt
also when_i asked_the_waiter if_i should try_the shahi_paneer or_the paneer_tikka_masala he said he_didn't know because_he didn't_eat vegetarian_food
in_a slightly rude manner
overall worth_the_trip and_they provide a_solid indian_food experience
this_restaurant_is really wonderful
went_on_a friday_evening
and_was greeted by_a friendly host right away
appetizers_and main course arrived quickly
the food_was_absolutely divine
the_flavors_were rich_and full
spicy
but_not_too spicy
the_kind_of food_that you_want_to keep eating even when_you_are full
the_staff_were all very_friendly_and_attentive
my_family will_definitely be_going to_this_restaurant again
it_was_a fluke that my_friend_and_i passed by mt
everest in_search_of a_quick lunch after visiting the salon
we passed by chinatown because she_could not_eat anything in_that vicinity
running short on time we_were_not able_to_get to_our original destination
while on_sahara we passed by this_place_and good_thing because my_heart was set on_indian
seeing that most of_my_friends has written so highly of_this_place
it_was_worth giving a_try
for
the_lunch_buffet_is one amazing deal
i wasted no_time
got_a plate_and created a mountain that would_give everest a run for_its money
saag_paneer will_always be my_favorite
i spooned some onto my_plate and_was elated with_the large cubes_of cheese swimming in_my spinach
the_sweet_rice can_be eaten on_its own as_a dessert like_the similarly florescent orange rice found_in vietnamese eateries or used_to balance out_the spice_in your favorite curry
i_ate it_with my_meal and_it contributed a_nice contrast to everything else on_my_plate
the_aloo_gobi was seasoned well
but did_not_have much cauliflower
the_goat_curry was_tender_and did_not possess the gaminess that people normally complain about
the stew did contain many small bone
i spent some_time picking through to_be safe
the_tandoori was_dry on_the_outside and_moist on_the_inside
i_have_never seen that before
so it_was_not a_total bust
if there_was_an aspect to complain about
it_was_that i_was_not at_the_table to_order garlic_naan
plain_naan just doesn't do anything for_me anymore
the_gulab juman are_delicious
but more_than two_of these fried milk balls and_i_am sure_to become diabetic
the_buffet_is good
but placing a_regular order is the_way_to_go
the_korma and_tikka curries_are both great
lousy part_of_town
but_the_food_is very_tasty
prices_are good
especially_when compared_to orange county
ca
my_favorite_indian_place in_vegas_for sure
everything_is spiced right
portions_are good and_filling
its one of_those places you_can be adventurous in ordering and_you wont go_wrong
stars_because i_cannot validate the care
and freshness of_everything as_they have_a_lunch_buffet
and buffet's for the_most_part are suspect
you_could do a_lot worse
plus my_friend tried_it who is_not an_indian_food fan
and_he did_not get sick
and_ate almost all_of_it
small victories
four_stars for meeting my_expectations based on other yelpers
we_were_not extremely hungry
i_ordered_the_chicken tandoori tiki
hope i_got that right
as i_don't_have my handy dandy asian indian_food guide close_by
and_my_wife
ordered the_okra
which_comes with_basmati_rice
we also_ordered garlic_nan
and for_a specialty beverage
the_mango_lassi
a_mango yogurt drink
i'll say up front
everything was_very_good
and_the_mango drink_was very_much like what_we drink
brasilian style
mixing papaya
mango or passion fruit
with_various forms of yogurt
ice_cream
or condensed milk
i bet i've passed this_place twenty five times over the_past few years when in_vegas on business
the_building is old looking
near_the bus stop at_the_front of_an older strip center
and in_an older section_of west vegas
but_once_you walk inside
see_a relatively nice interior
and_see the_many regulars we_saw
you're probably going_to_have the_same high level_of confidence we_had
while service_is stereotypical etchnic restaurant slow_and spotty
the_food does deliver
it will_never be as_good as homemade
if you cook indian at_home
but_then
as_a brasilian family
we rarely find stateside restaurants_that meet our standards
that's to_be expected
but having enjoyed indian_cuisine over_the years
i'm comfortable recommending this_restaurant
i've added mt
everest to_my
black book
of off strip restaurants
if_it's good_enough for_the many_indian clients i_saw there tonight
then i'm_sure it'll be_good enough_for you
remember that_indian clients could_go anywhere in_town
but_there_was a_good number_of couples and foursomes dining_in tonight
this alone told_us it must_have passed their test for authentic_and good enough_food preparation quality to compete with_their own home_cooked meals
so as they_say in_vegas
i'm_in
at least for this_indian_restaurant
i_love_indian_food_and this_place delivered
i_ordered_the standard fare for_me at an_indian_place
tandoori chicken_tika
chicken_masala
and_a mixed_grill dish
all were_very_good
i_was with my_parents and could_not ramp up the_spice so_it_was pretty_cool but_i_didn't order_it spicy
so_i_am curious to_hit this_place_and tell them max spice_and see how it_is
each_dish was_good i_thought_it was_kind_of odd that i_only got one rice_with what appears to_me to_be entrees
i requested a_second rice and_got charged
i dunno
thought_it could_be included
i_also_ordered these deep_fried chiles to_start
they_were_good but_really unpredictable
one chiles was melt your_face off the_next had nothing so_it_was an_interesting experience not_sure what would happen next
i_would_go again for_sure
everything_was done well_and the_food_was_good
hopefully with_some spice it_will_be great
oh_yeah
had_a_groupon there too which_was_nice
yummy buffet
reasonable_price
love their_chai
try their_buffet
their desserts was_awesome too
service_was_awesome
outstanding service
prakash is_awesome
food_is_delicious
i traveled all_the_way from green valley
henderson to_have_the sumptuous buffet
great_food
great people
i_love_indian_food_and am able to_cook most indian_dishes being an_indian from singapore
occasionally
we_will eat out_and my_first choice is mount_everest india's_cuisine
why
the_service rendered by prakash is_worth mentioning and_he caters to_our every needs
thank_you prakash for excellent_service and delicious_food
love_the tea too
first foremost
this_is_one_of our_favorite_indian buffet restaurant
scrumptious spread of fine_dining
loving every bit_of it
not forgetting their masala_chai desserts
we_were_served with tender
loving care by prakash
thanks once_again for attending to_us today as_always
we appreciate it
the_mt
everest is_the_best of_both veggie_and meat worlds
my_wife is a_vegetarian and_i_am on_the atkins diet
i_love_the huge selection_of meals and prakash
the_owner
is the_nicest man
the_restaurant_is spotless
table cloths
with endless attention_to detail
i_wish_i_had known about_this_place years_ago
try_the_buffet lunch_for welcome surprises
they change the food_selection every_day
we tried_the_lunch_buffet
it_was_wonderful
food_was_very fresh
service_was_prompt
the_only_reason i_am_giving stars instead_of is i_wish_the items_were listed in english as_well or_maybe just_a description
i_went_with my_husband who is_not_the biggest fan_of_indian_food and_i know_what_i like but_i can't_really explain exactly what_is in each_dish
took_my punjabi friend there_for_the buffet_lunch and_we really_enjoyed_it
will_be_back again again
cruising in_my lotus elise rental
i_wanted_to get_some good eats a_nice drive off_the_strip
indian_food popped up and_i dialed in_this_place
the_inside was_a_bit darker cooler than i_thought
with_just_the buffet lamps giving light besides the natural light
still pretty_nice
the_food_was_great and_the_waiter owner
was_nice
when_i_asked them about not_having rice kheer dessert
they_said it rotates with_other different_items
that_day had_a mango dessert
darn
to_my_surprise
he brings out_a complimentary bowl_of kheer
awesome
it is_one_of_my_favorite desserts
so simple
yet so_good
the_naan is_nice_and fluffy
too
i_am_a regular here
best value_for an_indian_lunch_buffet
the_naan never disappoints
try the_garlic_naan most_of_the_food is somewhat spicy_as it_should_be
the_owner doubles as_a waiter_and even_with tables_and booths the_service_is still excellent_and he_also works the_register
my fave indian_joint in_vegas
best lunch_buffet ever
the_food_is_always on_point great_selection and amazing_service
the_owner_is always in_the dinning room ensuring everyone_is enjoying their meal
this_place_is fantastic
everyone must_try
mmmmmmmmmmm
if_you_can look past the_fact_that this_place_is obviously a former burger_king
this_is_a_great lunch_buffet
jam packed on_a_weekday
the_only_thing we_had that we_weren't crazy about were the_samosas
they_were small_and not very_flavorful
otherwise
pretty solid
we went_for_the_lunch_buffet
which was_absolutely_amazing
the_service_was_great_and the_food_was unforgettable
i_highly_recommend_this_place
the_location_is easily accessible too
just_got finished_eating at mount_everest for_their_lunch_buffet and_i'm literally reeling in pain at_my desk
this opening line would work much better if you couldn't already see_the star_rating i'm_giving them
yes
this_is that sushi mon all_you_can_eat and_then some
pants button undoing type_of stomach pain
and_not_the having flashbacks of_the subway employee not washing his hands while making your sweet onion teriyaki chicken sandwich type_of pain
i_wish_i_could describe what_i ate in detail
but_the truth is i have_no_idea
on_the first plate i_tried everything_on_the right side_of_the hot buffet_items
which resulted in a_plate of_rice_and an assortment_of deliciously spiced veggie_and chicken_dishes along_with some veggie_samosas and pakoras
after a_while
sauces_were blending into each_other
pakora were getting smothered with_various other_items
left became right
black became white
and soon a harmonious melting pot had_been achieved on_my_plate that rivaled any buffet experience i've_had
with each bite i had_no_idea which item
s
i were_eating
but they_were_all fantastic
some of_these bites provided quite_a kick and_the quickly refilled iced_tea and_water were much appreciated
i_had_no need for_a nd plate
i_had_no room_for a nd plate
someone should_have stopped me
but alas
they_didn't
walking up_to_the buffet_line
the_only game plan i_had_was to_try everything_on_the left side that_i_didn't try the_first_time
chicken_curry
chicken something else
chicken something else
done
unfortunately i_also couldnt resist some_more daal
some_more samosas
some_more pakora
bites in i_knew i_was_in trouble
bites in_i started_to hurt
bites in_i tapped out
now an_hour later i'm finally starting to recover
you may_have won the battle mount_everest
but_i_will be_back_to win the war
first of_all
please don't_go by their advertisement
vegas's biggest indian_buffet
it_is_not
food was_alright
not good_selection_of appetizers
place is_ok
best_indian_food_in_vegas
highly_recommend
fantastic food_and_service
te best_indian_food_in_las_vegas by far
i_come at_least_once_a_week for_the_buffet lunch and_i_can honestly say i've_never_had a_bad_meal here
the_food_is_always fresh
hot_and ready to_go_for you as_soon as you_walk_in and_the bread_is always made_to_order and_at your_table as quick as can_be
i've been in_las_vegas_for four months_and don't_go any where else
the_staff sets everything apart
they_always welcome myself_and friends in_with a_smile and_fast service
you_can get good_food in other_places but_for great food_and_great_service you_have_to come_here
we_went_here in_our may trip
we_are generally pretty picky_about indian_food_as we_have_eaten in_india and almost_all across america in many_indian_restaurants
we_were craving_for some indian_food_in_vegas and_decided_to try here
from the_outside
it didn't_look that inviting
but_once
we_were_in
the service_was_awesome
every food we_ordered_was authentic_and to_our taste
tandoori_chicken_is one_dish that_i_am usually never satisfied in_most indian_restaurants_in_the states
but the_tandoori_chicken here just rocked
it_was juicy
scrumptious and perfectly_cooked
just_like the clay_oven cooked chicken in_india
we_love it
the_host was generous in proportions and_very_friendly
its_a little_gem in_vegas
best_indian_food_in_vegas
we_always go_here and_this food_is_delicious_and authentic
ok we_went_back again since_my company wanted_to_go and_i_think the_lack_of service_from my prior experience_was because the_owner_was stressed out
service_was_good again_and food was_actually much better and_flavorful when_you_order it fresh
food_with flavors
just wonderfull
they_never let my_water_glass get lower than_half
the_best
would you care to feed a_small army
does your army enjoy delicious_indian spiced foods
then bring them down_to mount_everest
i_don't_know why
but my_husband_and_i always_order our
staples
when we_go_to an_indian_restaurant and_we can_be pretty particular about_them
things_were no different here
our staples are
saag_paneer
called palak_paneer here
vegetable_korma
mango_lassi
and_garlic_naan
because we_had_a restaurant
com_coupon
we_were also able to_order paneer tiki_masala and vegetable_samosas
normally at other_indian_restaurants this_would_be_a ton_of_food for_us which
sadly
we_can finish if we_are hungry enough
but we_are giant pigs
mount_everest takes the cake for largest serving sizes in_the_valley
we_had two boxes of leftovers
you_are definitely getting your money's worth here
not_only are the_portions huge
but_this_is some_of_the_best_indian_food i've_had
they have_given my beloved mint a run for_their money
the_paneer tiki_masala had great_flavor and_lots_of paneer
plus the_paneer_was fantastic it_was denser than_most paneer and_had_a very_mild flavor
i could_be wrong
but it_seemed_like it_was made_fresh
the_vegetable_korma was mildly spiced
in_a good way
and_was loaded with_a_large variety_of fresh vegetables
the_saag_paneer was_a_little different_than what i'm_used_to
but_i_still enjoyed_it
it_was_a_little milder
had_a_lot_of cream
and the_spinach was_well blended
all these dishes_we_ordered medium
but_they_were pretty mild on_the spice
i_think_we could_have could_have ordered spicier and been ok
the_free papadums were_good_and i_enjoyed_the mint and_tamarind sauces
the_mango_lassi
while having a_very interesting intense orange color i'm_not used_to
was_very_good as_well
the_vegetable samosas_were gigantic but_a_little bit_on_the greasy side
the_garlic_naan had every inch covered_in garlic
hooray
but seemed_a_little uncooked in_the_middle
the_service_was_very friendly_but a_little_slow at_times
especially_when the_place began to_fill_up
the_building may_be_a little iffy on_the_outside
what_is that
an_old pizza hut
it was_very_nice on_the_inside and very_clean
plus they play bollywood movies
oh
and did_i_mention that they_gave us an_extra giant order_of rice_for all_our leftovers
for_free
overall
this is_a_great_place_to enjoy some delicious_indian_food
just be_prepared_to take some home
absolutely_delicious
best food_in_vegas
everything_we_had was_delicious
there_were six people on our_group and_all of_us_were very_happy_with the_food_and_service
every_dish was_perfect
we_came_here for_lunch_buffet when_i_was majorly craving_indian_food and_my_husband insisted we_finally try something other_than our usual place
mint
the_food_was honestly good
and spicier_than mint
which_was_a welcome change of pace
but_the surroundings are kinda bleh and_we didn't_get refills on_our naan_and we_had_to_wait forever in between pop refills
the_service_was_pretty iffy
the_buffet selection_is decent_and i_liked that_they_had samosas on_the_buffet
the_food_was_good_and i_wouldn't object to_going back but_there_are other_places that i_think offer a_better all_around experience
being_indian and_all
i_can cook indian_food fairly well
but_i seek out indian_restaurant for_the beautiful diversity of regional specialties that_i just_don't know_how_to cook or do_not_have the equipment to_cook
eg
tandoor oven
in_the years
that i_lived here i_have_yet_to find an_indian_restaurant_that blows me_away
but mt
everest is_one_of_the
better
ones
came_here on_a_saturday_night around
pm
not_the_best looking place from the_outside
but_still hopeful this_was_a diamond in_the rough
the_parking_lot was_full however
surprisingly there_were only_two other_tables filled
however
towards the_end_of our_meal the_restaurant filled out
my_husband_and_i got_there before the_other couple joining us
it_is one_of_their favorite_restaurants
the_staff immediately greeted_and seated_us
we had_a_few moments to_look around
decor is_a_bit dated with_the dark green upholstery
but_well kept
we_ordered_a bottle_of_wine from_the limited but reasonably_priced popular wines
once the_other couple arrived
they_were immediately recognized as familiar faces by the_staff
prior_to ordering we_were_served complimentary papadoms with_the tradition mint and_tamarind chutneys
we_ordered tandoori_chicken as_an_appetizer
this_is_a_great value given there_were atleast pieces
it_came_out sizzling hot
serve on_a cast iron skillet
i_wanted_to love_it as its sight and sound captured my senses
but_it_was missing that aromatic smell
that_is right
it_was_not aromatic or flavorful
kind of bland for tandoori
but_nothing offensive and_definitely well prepared
still worth getting
because_it comes_out fresh_and sizzling
just spritz with lemon and sprinkle salt it_is more_than fine
shortly after_our main_dishes came out palak_paneer
chicken_tikka
rogan_josh
garlic_naan
and_a_side kachumber salad
first_off
the_portions_were plentiful
and more_than enough_to feed four hearty adult appetites and_two for_lunch_the_next_day
the_palak to the_palak_paneer makes that dish silky
creamy_and very comforting
but_could use a_bit_more spice although_it_was ordered at a_level on spice scale
to
the_chicken_tikka was_tasty_and familiar in_the sweet
tomatoey style
i_prefer it slightly less sweet
but again
well_made and worth_trying
the rogan josh's flavor_was complexly layers and my_favorite_dish
it_almost like_my moms
however
we_ordered_it at a_level spiciness
but_it_was much milder than expected
although_i don't_eat bread
according_to my_fellow dinners the_garlic_naan_was fresh
warm_and soft
the kachumber salad was standard
throughout our_meal
the_manager owner
kept checking to_make_sure we_were satisfied and_of_course
asking if_we_wanted more wine once we_finished the bottle we_order
he_gave us generously filled glasses for
and_we_had_a friendly conversation
overall
the_food_was prepared_with quality_ingredients and_with care
but lacked a_bit_of seasoning
i_haven't returned to_many indian_restaurants_in_vegas
but_i_am sure to_return to_mt
everest because the_food_is_good
well_priced
and the_manager_and staff_is_friendly
a_special combination lacking_in most_indian_restaurants
stars
outstanding food
incredibly friendly_service
slightly understaffed
but we_are patient dinners
for_the_price the_quality_and portion_size was_wonderful
if the_food_was_not so affordable
then_i would_have_been turned off_by the_atmosphere
it's certainly is_not classy
but doesn't offer any warm old divey feelings to placate my_heart either
i_would_come here_again and_again
i_kept hearing
that_was the_best_indian_food_i've_ever had
from fellow patrons
and for_the_price i_would agree
you literally have_to_pay twice as_much to_come close_to beating mount_everest
always a_great_experience
food_is_amazing with_a excellent variety_of spices
excellent place_for_indian buffet
i stayed in_las_vegas_for days and i_tried couple_of indian_restaurant but_this stands out because_of_the quality_and variety_of_food available
a
best_indian_buffet i've_had
ever
used a_groupon deal here
wasn't sure it_was_good for the_thali
which if_you_go to_an_indian restaraunt is_your best deal
you_get a_bit_of everything
like previous reviewers
this_place_is owned by nepalese
when_you drive up it_looks almost_like it_is dark
not open from the_outside
but_i_think thats because_of_the glare stuff they_have on the_windows for the_heat during_the day time
the_service_was_great
we_ordered_a vegetarian thali and_i_ordered_the mt
everest thali
which_came_with lamb
tandoori_chicken_and butter_chicken
along_with_the vegeterian options
normally at other_indian_restaurants i_never get appetizers with the_thali
this came_with_the usual paperdums
which_had both mint_chutney and tamarind_chutney
which_was made_fresh you_could tell
in_addition_to that we_got pakoras
fried califlower
and appetizers size chicken pieces_and lamb
ours came_with dessert
rice_pudding_and gulab jamman
the_best we_have_had thus far
the_gulab was_nice_and firm and_the syrup was thick not watery like_i normally have experienced
we also_ordered chai
it came_in a_big oz cup
like_a take way
and_was made_fresh because_it_was pipping hot
my_boyfriend wanted_to_go back the_next_day just_for_the tea
highly highly_recommend_this
especiallyif you_know your indian_food
much better_than tamba on_the_strip
per very positive yelp_reviews
a_couple_of friends_and_i stopped_in here one evening
and_very glad_we did
food_was_amazing service_was_excellent
we_ordered saag_paneer
chicken_tikka_masala_and garlic_naan all phenomenal
and_i eat quite_a_bit of_indian_food
our_server
which i_believe was_also the_owner
was_incredibly nice_and sincerely thankful for_our business
such great_service seems hard_to come_by these days
so this_place really made an impression on_me
i'd recommend_it_to any one in_town craving something other_than hangover pizza
excited for leftovers tomorrow
got here_at exactly
we_were_seated and given papadam right away
the_staff_were friendly
food_was_delicious
the chai_tea was_excellent
the_best_i've_had
it_was_just a_little_bit_of a_wait but i_didn't_care since_i had_all night
lol
i_shared_the appetizer with my_bf
it_really filled me_up
i_was done after that
great_price
must_try mt_everest thali specials for
trust_me its a_lot_of_food
didn't i_mention
awesome customer_service
for sho'
my_boyfriend_and_i tried_this because_of a_groupon now offer
and we_weren't disappointed
we ordered_a_chicken appetizer
the paalak paneer_and a_lamb_dish we_had not heard_of before
along_with some_garlic_naan
the_order was_more_than we_could finish
even_though_we enjoyed every_bite
particularly
the_lamb_was so_tender and succulent
the_atmosphere_was comfortable and_the_owner came_to greet us
we would_definitely go_back again
a surprisingly awesome buffet_in a_place i_would_have never guessed
a_bit_of_a shady corner next_to a gas station
easily the_best indian_buffet_in_town
this_place offers_a small_but very_tasty buffet
about items or_so
accompanied by some_delicious naan
the_owner_is very cordial and_welcoming and_will make sure your_table is_well taken_care of
a_lunch_buffet with a_mango_lassi
very_tasty
btw
will run about and_will_be worth_every_penny
they_also_have_a la_carte items
which i_have_never tried
but_i bet they_are just a_tasty as_the buffet_items
i've_never_had indian_food_before so_i_don't have_much to_compare this_place_to
you definitely have_to_be somewhat adventurous with_the different strong smells and exotic looking food haha
i_would_say that_i enjoyed_the_food but_the poor_service i_received is_why i_am_giving them stars
when_we_walked into the_restaurant we_weren't really greeted_and the_girl just pointed at a_table for_us_to sit at
we_went and filled our_plates with a_little_bit_of_everything
no_one came to_take_our drink_orders so_i_had flag someone down_for some water
then_a guy dropped off some_naan and_i said
oh
but we_wanted_to_try the_garlic_naan
can we get_some please
and_the man just rudely said we_had finish this order first
we kept having to_flag someone down to_refill our_drinks
ugh
i_will_say though that i_loved_the hot fresh garlic_naan_and_the delicious chicken_curry
so_much so_that i_find myself craving_it
hopefully next_time the_service will_be better
i'm normally not a_fan_of_indian_food
but this_place_is am az ing
we_ordered_a ton_of_food and gobbled it_down like vagabonds who had_been starving in the_desert for centuries
i_highly_recommend_the chicken_tikka masalla and okra dishes
ps
you definitely can't judge this book_by its cover
my_parents in law
husband_and_i were_looking_for some_really good_indian_food on_our thanksgiving trip to_las_vegas
my in laws had_been to_this_restaurant before_but this_was_the_first time_for my_husband_and_i
we_were_not_disappointed
the_food_was_very tasty
but_not oily at_all
the_buffet selection was_wonderful
lots_of chicken_and non_vegetarian choices along_with vegetables_and dessert_and salad
the_service_was_excellent and_the_atmosphere was_perfect
my father in law does not_eat naan and_the_restaurant offered to_make him roti's instead at no charge
they_are_so kind
the_best_part
at
per_person for_lunch
this_is_the_best deal you_can get
i_wish_they had_a location where_i live_in california
i plan_on visiting this_restaurant everytime_i come to_las_vegas
please visit_this_place next_time you_are in_las_vegas
i_have nothing bad to_say at_all
excellent_indian_food
don't_be scared by_the looks of the_building
i run a software company with employees in bangalore and travel there a_couple_of_times a_year
so while_i wouldn't call myself any_kind_of expert
i_do know when the_palak spices aren't fresh or the_nan_was left sitting
neither_of those things happened at mount_everest
definitely recommended
this_is our go_to place_when we're craving an_indian_lunch_buffet
favorite items include their murgh makhani
butter_chicken
and_saag
in_fact
their saag is_so incredibly tasty that_we suspect it_is prepared_with msg
the wifey gets very sleepy after consuming msg so_we generally avoid it
but yet we keep coming_back_for more
although the_ambiance needs refreshing and their_naan_is too doughy for_our taste
overall this_is_the_best tasting place_in_town
stars_for_the food
stars_for_the service
pleasant size
and great_price
for a_small buffet it_had great_variety
i_particularly liked_the goat_curry_and sweet_rice
what really made_my visit great was the_owner
he_was constantly attending to_all_the tables
providing refills on water_and asking his guests how their meals tasted
attentive_and kind
while providing great_food
earns stars in_my_book
this_is_by_far my_favorite_place for_indian_food_and i've_been_to many_places all_over_the city
the_food_here_is comforting
full_of delicious spices
and_nicely priced
the_entrees come_with delectable basmati_rice
which_you usually have_to_order separately at_other_places
and_the_naan the fluffiest
softest pieces_of heaven
the_buffet has a_good_selection_of tasty things
and_its always different so you_get_to try_everything
the_owner_is so personable and_nice
we come_here at_least_once_a month
if_not more often
and_will continue to_do_so
love_this_place
fantastic lunch_buffet_and friendly_staff
the_saag_paneer is_the_best
love_the service_and_food
this_place really has a_family_run establishment atmosphere
perfect naan_and paneer tiki_masala
hands down
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
the_naan comes_out hot
the_saag_paneer is_amazing
masala_sauce is the_best_i've_ever_had
the_owner_is_a very_nice guy_who isn't afraid_to roll up his sleeves and wait tables
try the_lunch_buffet_for a_wonderful variety_of_dishes
the_only_problem i've ever_had here_is eating too_much
the_food_is_delicious_and the service_is_excellent
i've_had their_buffet a_couple_times
and it_never disappoints there_are the_typical things_that i_know and_love
but_there_are always other_dishes to try_that are_always yummy
when_we come for_dinner
i usually_get chicken_makhani at_a spicy level positively to_die_for
i_know there_are other places_in_town
but if_you_want the_best_indian_food
look no further than mt
everest
i_love_this_place
i've_eaten here_many_times and they've never disappointed
the_food_is_delicious i_almost always_get the_chicken_tikka_masala
but the_chicken_tandoori is_to_die_for
spicy without being too_much
and_the_naan
i've_had garlic_and regular
is_fabulous
really
all_the_food i've_had here has_been excellent
i_also love their_lunch_buffet
it's_a_good deal at
and_there_is always great_variety
i've been_able_to try many_things that_i_would have_never ordered
goat_curry yum
but_there_are also always some of_my_favorites
their_dinner menu_is reasonably_priced
especially_with a_groupon
but the_lunch_buffet_is definitely the_deal to_get if_you're_in_the area at_lunch time
the_first_time_i went the_location was_a_little scary it's on the_corner next_to a gas station and mariana's supermarket and the_outside is_not super bright
i_was_a_little nervous
but as_soon_as_i stepped inside i_felt much better
it_is_a cute place tablecloths on_the tables
well lit
not bright but definitely_not
shady
and_the people_are so_nice
i've_always had excellent_service definitely the_nicest servers i've_had in_a_long_time
i_definitely highly_recommend mt
everest
roti's were softest ever and buffet_items were decent
i_am_giving one_star because_of_the rudeness i_received
we_wanted_to order_from menu_and we_were_told there_is_a minimum per head including kids for ordering
this_is after the_waiter asked_us if_we_wanted to_order
owner manager came and_told_us that_there_is such_a minimum and thats why they provided buffet
kind of telling us we cant afford per head luxury of ordering from menu
so if_you_are desperate for_food
go_here
food_was no good
there_were lots_of indian customers inside
is_it a sign_of good_indian_food
for_our taste
not_good at_all
couldn't even find a_spicy dish
find another place in_lv
wow
we_went_for_dinner tonight at
shady looking building but_the inside_is cute and_of_course it smells amazing
the men working were so_nice
we_ordered_a lot
the_fried paneer
shrimp tikka_masala
shrimp_vindaloo
garlic_naan
lamb naan
and_mango_lassi
everything seriously was spectacular
indian_food_is my_favorite and my_boyfriend_and_i are_very judgmental diners
i'm not_sure i've had_better_indian_food than_this
the_only suggestion i would_make is to_use larger shrimp
one_of_the guys even_brought over_a rose for_me as_we_were leaving
thank_you all_for giving us such_a_great experience
we come_here every_time we're in_las_vegas
which_is times a_year
major trade shows
and weekends away
and_the_owner
prakash always recognizes us
which_is_nice
the_food_is_great
especially the_vindaloo
which is_my_favorite
get the_samosas
and_some naan_to round out your_meal
bring_your appetite
the_portions_are generous
and_the_prices very_reasonable
well_with_the trip off_the_strip
first let me say i'm_not_a vegas guy
if_i never_came back_here i'd be_happy
and trying to_get_a decent affordable meal on or around the_strip is_a nightmare
if you're being wined and dined
then by all means
have_the sales manager take you_to whatever over_priced bellagio restaurant you_see fit
if
like_me
a_great_meal in_a quiet place_is what you're after
run
dont walk
to_mt
everest
prakash and_the fellas serve up some_of_the tastiest indian_cuisine i've ever_had
don't_let_the neighborhood
it's_quite safe
or_the former pizza hut exterior deter you
as_soon as you_walk inside it_feels_like an oasis
and_the delicious smells of_curry and_tandoori greet you
the_chicken_tikka
served sort of fajita style
was_tender_and delicious
and_spiced to_perfection
the_saag_paneer
one_of_my_favorite_indian dishes
was savory_and so inviting that i_kept going_back_to it as_i
filled in_the corners
at the_end_of_the_meal
when i'd already eaten too_much
we_also_had their_lamb curry_which_was not_a ground lamb_curry but featured a_generous portion_of cubed lamb shoulder perfectly_cooked and_tender
this is_my_new go_to spot in_this ridiculous town
mount_everest is_fabulous
my_husband_and_i went to_have_some dinner_and we_didn't realize the_time
the_restaurant_was actually closed and_the_owner prakash welcomed us and_gave us the_option to_order take_out
we_really appreciated that
and_we_were worried that his staff would_be upset with_us for ruining their closing routine
prakash was_so_nice and_he took_our_order and we_even ordered extra sides after we_had put the_original order in
and_he still accommodated us
he_didn't even charge us_for the_extra sides
we_will_definitely come_here again within hours when we_are_in town next_time
the_food_was_amazing spicy like_we enjoy
we noticed this_place as_we_were out driving around
we thought_it_was_a drive through indian_restaurant
which_we thought_was such_a_great idea that_we_had to_check_it_out
to_our disappointment
the_drive through window isn't operational
going inside
i_expected fast_food furnishings and_decor to match the_outside of_the_restaurant
no_way
white tablecloths and cloth napkins
waiters attending to_the patrons
and_best of_all
fragrant
delectable indian_cuisine at_a
lunch_buffet
the disappointment of_the non working drive through window was_completely forgotten once_we experienced the excellent_food
it_was_so_good that_we kept embarrassing ourselves
mmm
mmmma
oh_my gosh this is_so_good
every_dish was_fresh
seasoned perfectly
not_greasy
gamy or too_salty
occasionally they_even changed the_food
putting out_a completely different dish in place of_something that_was there_before
the_naan_was amazing
i_could go_there just for_the_naan
they_offered more
but_we_had to_say
no thank_you
because the_rest_of_the food was_so_good
the_vegetarian_dishes were_at a_separate warming table than_the chicken_dishes
this speaks volumes for how_they care_for their_customers
and i'm_sure the_vegetarian customers appreciate this
the_service_was impeccable
our water_glasses_were kept full
even the_water was_good no chlorine taste
they_didn't bring_a check so we_paid on_the_way out
but_that might just_be how_they do_it there
which_is fine by us
we_gave the_highest tip percentage that_we give due_to_the fine service_and quality_of_food
we_will_definitely_be_back
this_is now officially our place_for_indian_food
we_just went_back again today
it_was every bit as_good this_time
and they_offered an accommodation for_our disabled son without our asking_for it
which_was very_kind
we'll be_back_again soon
some_of_the_best_indian_food in_the_area
to_be_honest
it's not_in_the nicest neighborhood
but if_it's mighty tasty_food you crave
at_a_very reasonable_price
take_the minute drive off_the_strip to_enjoy delicious grub
don't_be scared by_the exterior
which rather needs some tlc
because the_interior_is actually quite_nice and cozy
and_well maintained
try the_vindaloo
it's some_of the_best_i've_ever_had anywhere
i_wouldn't recommend the_salad
it's not_exactly as pictured
the_naan
however
is fragrant and_fluffy
the_owner actually still recognizes us_from when we_visited one year_ago
either we're funny looking
or he's got_a good memory
the_best indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
don't waste_your time
money or taste_buds any where besides mt
everest indian cusine
i_have_tried almost all_of_the indian_restaurants_in_las_vegas
tamba indian_restaurant was the_worst of_all i_would_not eat_there even for_free
if_you_want real_indian experience of_indian cusine then definitely you_should go_and try_this_place out
best_of all excellent customer_service from all_of staff
guru
great_food
great_service
the_staff took great care_of our needs
the_owner even assisted in waiting on_us and brought_us a_free dessert at_the_end_of our dining
we frequent indian_restaurants_in all major cities we_visit due_to lack_of options_in arkansas
i_would_say this_was_one_of_the_best we_have_been too
we_visit las_vegas often and we_will_be visiting mount_everest during_our next_trip
well_worth_the cab ride from_the_strip and we_just hailed a_cab from the_street when_we_left
this trip_to_vegas my_husband put_the kabosh on expensive strip restaurants
so_after yelping the_best off strip restaurants we_decided_to see_what all_the fuss was_about
the bottom_line
in_case you_don't wanna read on
food so_good we_came_here days in_a row
don't_let_the neighborhood scare you
only_a lil sketchy
the_food_is spectacular
best_indian_food we ever_had
ever
we_tried_the mt_everest thali which_was plenty of_food_for big eaters
the_naan_is yummers both plain and_garlic
even the_lamb
which i'm_pretty picky_about was so_tasty
not gamey at_all
our favorite_dishes
chicken_tikka_masala
saag_paneer
we came_back for_the_lunch_buffet the_day after
i_highly_recommend it if_you_like variety_and don't really_know the_names_of the_dishes
there_wasn't_a single thing_we didn't_like
not_only_is the_food amazing but service_is_great
prakash is_a_great host
we_will_be coming_here every_time_we come_to vegas
i_went_here to convert two_of my girlfriends to_try and like_indian_food
and_it_was_a success
a classmate of_mine told_me about_this_place
she said this is_hands_down her favorite_indian_restaurant in_the_city
so_after a_couple months of persuading
my two friends_who aren't so adventurous in cuisines as_much_as_i am
finally decided_to accompany me to_mt
everest
i'd admit the venue is_a_bit sketchy but_i_just kept pulling the_two inside
i already know my_favorite indian_dishes
so_i_ordered for my_friends since they_don't know what dishes_are what
we_went_for chicken_tikka_masala
korma
and_tandoori
i_thought those dishes_were the_most
friendly
to those who've never had_indian_food_before
so yeah
we also_got garlic_and regular_naan combination
and_mango_lassi
my_favorite
i_liked every_dish we_ordered
especially the_korma
i_can't stop dipping my garlic_naan into_it
and the_lassi was_just perfect
i_wanted_to drink a_whole pitcher if_i_could
the_service was_very_friendly_and he_didn't hesitate_to help us_with any questions regarding the_dishes
in past experiences with indian_restaurants
i_felt_like the_service have_been quite rushed and somewhat rude
but mt
everest's server was_quite congenial
i_think_the prices aren't bad and the_serving was_enough for_people to_share
i_think i've_found my_go_to indian_restaurant
i'll definitely try their_lunch_buffet
hubby_and_i went_here a_couple_of_weeks ago_with a_restaurant
com_coupon
we_like indian_food_and based_on_the reviews were looking_forward_to this_place
it_was virtually empty when_we_arrived
and we_were_seated_immediately
i_mentioned our coupon_for off_with_a purchase of or_more
so_we_had to_eat a_lot
easy enough
our_waiter
who i_think was_also the_owner manager
suggested the_tandoori_chicken to_start as_an_appetizer
eat a_few pieces_and take the_rest home
which_is_what we_did
the_chicken_was that awful red color that you_find on most tandoori_chicken
but it_was_very moist_and delicious_as were the_onions and_peppers served along_with_the chicken
side note
we_have only_had tandoori_chicken at_one other restaurant_in_town that_wasn't that awful red
and it_was_the_best ever
but_i digress
we_ordered two kinds_of naan
garlic_naan_and lamb filled naan
the_lamb filled naan was_ok
but didn't_have a_real lamby taste
but the_garlic_naan omg i_could_have made a_meal on just_that
i_wanted a_lamb_dish for my_entree and rogan_josh was suggested
and_it_was_delicious
very_tender and_the_sauce was_perfect
put some on_my lamb
the_rice_and scooped up_some with_naan
my_husband got_a fish_curry
it_seemed to_me to_be_very much the_same sauce_that was_on_the lamb but_with fish chunks in_it
i_wasn't crazy about_it
but_he really_enjoyed_it
we_also_had_a cauliflower and_potato dish_that we_really_enjoyed
i_forgot to_order raita
which_i usually love with_indian_food
we too got_a complimentary rice_pudding dessert
which unfortunately we_were too full to_finish
but it_was_delicious too
so next_time i'll make room_for it
i_didn't notice the_neighborhood
it's in_a_strip_mall with_a_large mariani's supermarket behind it
it's_not inexpensive
but definitely_not over_priced
while it_is number two on_our list_of favorites
it_is somewhat less expensive and_definitely closer_to home than our number one
so we_will_definitely_be returning very_soon
everest was part_of my quest for the_best_indian_food vegas had to_offer
luckily
it_was_quite fantastic
i've been_back a_couple_times
and both_times have_been full_of great_flavors
i_don't_remember the_exact name
but there_is_an option on_the_menu i'm a_huge_fan_of
it's essentially a large_selection of_their foods
in little metal dishes
lined up_and ready for consumption
it's delicious
it's a_great_way_to familiarize yourself with indian_cuisine quickly
if you're new_to it_all
both_of my experiences here have_been with_this item
everything has_been of great_quality and_flavor
like most_indian_restaurants
the na'an is extra
however
you_do have a_choice_of regular and_garlic na'an
maybe some_other choices as_well
always go with_garlic
you're welcome
the_atmosphere_is dark for_dinner
almost questionably so
service_is acceptable
although my_first_visit here wasn't positive in terms_of recommendations
we_asked some questions about the_menu_and they must_have interpreted that_as
you_want everything you're asking about
we_got a_lot_of_food back
this wasn't good on_the server's part
because really
who orders that many entrees without question
who doubles up_on the_same item
just keep a careful eye ear out
other_than the overloaded order mishap
i'll have_to_be back hear for_this amazing lunch_buffet i_keep hearing about
updates to_come
mt
everest's food_is_good
it covers indian_cuisine from different parts of_india
which_is_nice
the_lunch_buffet_is huggggggggggggggge
like waaaaaaay tons_of options
i_like that_they_have sweet_rice
because that makes_me think_of my mom's sweet_rice
and_well nostalgia makes everything taste better
they_have_a nice_selection of meats too
i've never seen a_lunch_buffet serve goat meat
gotta give_the props on that_one
the_naan is_fresh_and fluffy
i_like_that they_give_you both plain and_garlic_naan
their roti is_decent
overall
it's_a_good option when home_cooked indian_food isn't happening
let me start by saying_that the_food_is_delicious
on most days
my_review will_be covering my lunch_buffet experience only
so please keep that in_mind when reading
pros
plenty of_variety chicken_tikka
tandoori_chicken
saag_paneer and_so forth
the_naan_is freshly made
but be_sure_to mention custom requests such_as garlic_naan etc while you_are being_seated
or they assume you_want_it plain
cons
while the_food_quality ranges from good_to excellent
the customer_service_is lacking
depending on_the season
the_owner_is_a really chill guy
but_he seems have person working all_the tables sometimes
which gets chaotic during_lunch rush
and customer_service suffers
i've noticed he's hired more staff lately
but_i suspect its only seasonal
my note to_him keep your location well staffed
i_love_their carrot dessert
gajar halwa
which_is light years better_than_the sugary gulab_jamun
they_have_a salad_bar
which is_decent
my advice to readers you better make_sure_you are leading an active lifestyle
if indian_buffet is_your goto for_lunch
although the_food_here_is tasty delicious goodness
its_not really_good for_your body
authentic_indian_food isn't this greasy or creamy
and_most indian_people don't_eat like_this
because_of_the health implications of_eating such loaded items
i_tend_to go_there once every weeks
maybe once a_month
i_have_eaten_at everest many_times
the_aloo muttor gobi
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_biryani
garlic_naan
and_more
the_owner_and staff have consistently been helpful
i will_be_returning soon
i'm_a_huge fan_of_indian_food
it_all started in a_place back_home in daytona beach fl just_a_few years_ago
since then i've been on_the hunt for_more great indian_restaurants
i just_can't get_enough of the_chicken_makhani
also known as butter_chicken
lamb_korma_and naan_bread
so_yummy
this_place was_really_great
the_flavors_were great_and very_fresh
i_agree_with all the_reviews
i_do think_the service_was_a_bit_slow
it_seemed the_hostess was_also taking orders and closing tickets
we_had_a show to_go_to so_we literally had to_take_the check up_to_the register to_pay our bill
i_still don't_think_i have_found a match for_the place_in daytona beach but_this_is very_close
highly_recommended
no_complaints or disappointments
i_have_been searching for_a_good indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
there_are many place who claim to_have it and_they fall short
my_first_visit to_mt
everest proved to_be nothing less than fantastic
this family_owned and worked restaurant offers the authenticity i_have_been searching_for
the_food_was nothing less than fantastic
it_was fresh
delicious_and great
we_ordered_the garlic_naan
chicken mahkhani
lamb_saag and_an onion potato cake
everything_was delectable
additional note
the restrooms were_extremely clean
which_is another great sign of_a_restaurant for_me
if_they care enough_to properly maintain their restrooms
then they genuinely care_about their business
there_are several restaurants in_this valley that charge huge prices_for everything and_their bathrooms are trashed
i_love_this_place
this truly is_some_of_the_best indian_food_you can_get in_las_vegas
their_lunch_buffet_is awesome
and_the best_part_is they_are_not afraid of actually giving some heat to their_dishes unlike some_of_the_other indian spots in_vegas
the_food
finally some heat with_my lunch_buffet food
the_food_here isn't too_spicy it_has just_enough heat to_get_the job done
you start in_the vegetarian section which_has some amazing dishes then move your way_to the_meats
i_love_the chicken_dishes and_the_goat curry_is one_of_my_favorites
you then move onto condiments and desert
make_sure_to grab some plain yogurt and chutney to_dip your naan into
service
if anything is low just let the_owner know and he_has them cook_it right away
service_is_excellent water or soda glasses are kept full
if you come_in after_they stop cooking for_the_buffet the_owner will let you_know when_you_walk in
he_will also ask you to_go take_a look_at what he_has out_to make_sure_you would_like_to stay
also don't_forget if_you_are just driving by during_the_lunch_buffet hours you_can grab a_to_go box and load it_up for the_same_price as the_lunch_buffet
this_place is_one_of_my_favorite las_vegas indian_food spots
it_doesn't quite hit the_same level as mint for_me but_it_is up_there
stopped by this_place twice the_last two_times i_went las_vegas
loved the_mango_lassi
awesome service_and friendly_too
would_go there_again
my_wife_and_i drove past this run down
ex burger_king shack on_sahara dozens of_times before_we finally_got over_the creep factor and_tried eating_there
it_was_worth_it
the_atmosphere inside won't win any prizes but_the_food passes the test compared_to the_other_indian options in_town
the_lunch_buffet has_some interesting selections you don't_see very often
and_overall we_had_a relaxing
tasty_and filling weekday_lunch here
we'll probably return when_we don't_feel like going all_the_way down to_mint
the lesson
don't judge_a restaurant by_its fa ade
or its interior
for_that matter
this_place_has the_best_indian_food_in_town
i've_lived in_las_vegas years_and i_have_tried many restaurants
and_i keep coming_back_to this_one and_have_never been_disappointed
this_one should go right up_in_the
best of_las_vegas
along_with pin kaow on rainbow
for best thai food
their_lunch_buffet_is reasonably_priced_and you_get a_lot_of choices
their butter_chicken is_the_best
and_their chicken_curry is_awesome also
and they_serve you fresh_naan with_the_buffet
if_you_go for_dinner
its a_lot_more expensive
but_you of_course can_order anything on_the_menu_that way
the_owner_is always there_at lunchtime and knows us too well because_we are_always there
i_highly_recommend it

mt
everest_is a_fantastic hole in_the_wall indian_restaurant
i had_a_few hours to kill before flying out_of vegas today
and_wanted_to grab_a leisurely bite to_eat
while i'm_not usually a_fan_of buffets
i'm a_small dude
the_value isn't there for_me
i_know the_lunch_buffet_is the norm with indian_cuisine
everything_was_very fresh_and_tasty
the_naan_was particularly_good
as_was_the vegetable daal
and_the_owner and_his family were_very_friendly and_accommodating
i_don't pass through vegas often
but_i'll stop at_mt
everest the_next_time i'm in_town
my_favorite_indian_restaurant
gaylord
is_now out_of business and_other indian_restaurants_i've_been_to have_been mediocre which_is why i'm so_glad i_gave mount_everest a_try eventhough the_place was_kind_of creepy
the_quality_of_the_food is comparable to gaylord's but you_get more_food and pay a_lot less
the_people that work here_are very_nice_and friendly
they_have bollywood videos on at_all times
they_give_you_a basket_of papadum with_mint and_tamarind sauces
we_started of with samosa
they're like potato filled empanadas with ginger and_spices
and aloo_tikki
fried patties of mashed potatoes_in chick_pea batter
mango lasi
creamy mango shake
veggie_samosa
you_get two pieces for
the crust was the_right thickness and wasn't_too doughy
you_can definitely taste the_spices
i_had_to use_the tamarind_sauce to tone down the_heat a_bit
very_filling
aloo_tikki
you_get patties for
crispy deep_fried mashed potatoes
very_filling as_well
great_flavor
palak_paneer
i_was_looking_for the_cheese on top since that's_what i'm_used_to
garlic_naan
i_love_this stuff
we_had orders
hot
garlicky and buttery bread_to scoop dip saucy dishes_with
chicken_tikka_masala
my_favorite_indian dish
we_ordered mild but_it_was_still quite_spicy
but_it burned so_good
kulfi
a_mild cheesy ice_cream and_you_can see pistachio bits
gulab_jamun
my_favorite_indian dessert
they're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup
i honestly wasn't expecting the_food_to_be that_good
this_is_my new_favorite in_vegas
they_also_have_a lunch_buffet from am pm for
i'd come_back_here for_that
love_this_place
the_food_is_great
i_had_the curry chickin and_my fiance had a_lamb_dish
we_also_had_a few appertizers
everything_was so unbelievably tasty
fresh and_the_food_was served piping_hot
the_place_was small_and not_really fancy but clean and_a_nice atmosphere
awesome authentic_indian_food
ambience is_not_that good but_the_food_is just great
one_of the_best_in us
i_love_this_place
i_love how every_time_i need another refill it_has already been done
they_have this chilli_chicken dish which_is little pieces_of_chicken covered_in their special chilli sauce_and cooked for long time_to become delicious as_it_is
i_have_been trying to_find_a great_indian place_for a_while_and this_one does it for_me
i_love the_service_here and_will continue to_come_back
being spoiled with california's many_indian_restaurants
i_was sad when_i came_back to_las_vegas to_find_a very_limited selection_of places to_get_my chicken_tikka_masala_and garlic_naan cravings taken_care of
i_thought_the only way to_get_my fix was_to fly back_to_the bay to_get_it
but_then i_came across this_place
i_have probably driven passed this_place_a billion times before_i considered to_try_it and honestly
it_wasn't until i_saw_the awesome ratings from yelpers before_i decided it_was_a go
boy am_i happy i_did
everything_on their_menu_is so_flavorful and_rich
my_boyfriend_and_i looooooooove this_place
it's inside of_what used_to_be_a burger_king in_front_of_the mariana's supermarket
the_area isn't aesthetically pleasing
but_don't you dare judge_a book_by it's cover
their service_is hospitable
kind of quiet_and shy
but hospitable nonetheless
their_mango lasse is amazeballs
their_chai is alright
probably wouldn't order_it again though
the papadams
spelling
and_the little sauces that get served before you_order are_so dainty and_delicious
if you ever come for_their_lunch_buffet
don't plan_on eating for_the_rest_of the_day
haha
they_have_an awesome selection_and everything_is fresh
we're so_excited that we_found_this_place
the boyfriend_and_i were talking about_how we_don't know_why indian_food has such_a negative social stigma when_it's actually delicious
but_i_guess we don't_really mind
more for_us
the_portions_were larger than_we expected
the_mango_lassi_was delicious
and_they_have a_huge variety_of_dishes on_their_menu
it_is_very rare that_i change my_first impression
but_that_was the_case here_with this_one
my_first_visit to mount_everest was_not a_good_one
i_didn't_think there naan_was_good
didn't try the_sweet_rice
and the_samosas_were overcooked
well
wow
i_have_been back like
times in_the_past month since that initial visit
it is_by_far my_favorite indian_lunch_buffet place
i_had_in the running but mt_everest is_on top
first
the_price
i_believe it_is
not_bad
second
the choices
it_has the_most choices i've seen
what could make this_place better
if their labels were_more specific
i_love_the way some buffets put
vegetarian
as_a_vegetarian i_like a_quick reference guide to vegetarian_options
but
with_my minor knowledge of_indian_food i_know_what most_of_their dishes_are
if_it_were my_first exposure to_indian_food
however
i_would_be s
o
l
also another thing they_could make better
their_naan
i_don't_like their_naan
i_like buttery
garlicy soft guusy naan
this_is_not my_favorite_place for naan
saffron is
if_you_like medium textured
little buttered
barely garlic ed naan then you_would like_it
other_than_that
it's so_good
their choices are_amazing
final thing
this_is_the nutrition student in me
they_are_so sanitary
one_of_the only_indian buffets_i've seen with in place
sneeze guards
on their_buffet
their_buffet_is actually buffet_style so_it has_the coverings
furthermore
their bathroom has_a sanitary spray above_the handle
how great
so even_if nasties don't wash their hands
i_won't get_their germs from when_they open the_bathroom door open
foodborne illness is_no joke
yo
p
s
try the_sweet_rice
p
s

the_bollywood they play on tv is_a_great compliment to the_atmosphere
a colleague and_i changed our business lunch venue to mount_everest today and_i'm sooooo glad_we did
i_love_indian_food_and haven't_had any in_a_while other_than the boil in_a pouch variety from trader joe's so_i jumped at the_chance to_try_a place_in_town i_hadn't been_to before
just pulling up_and waiting outside_the aroma was_so enticing i_could tell good_things awaited
of_course
since_we_were there_for_lunch we_got_the buffet
as_someone who primarily eats vegetarian_vegan i_was immediately impressed_with_the number_of veggie_dishes offered and_i_loved the_fact_that they separated the_meat_dishes into a_different station all together
everything_i loaded up my_plate with_was delish
from the_basmati_rice
dal
veggie_korma
samosas_and pakoras everything_was outstanding
the_service_was super kind and_prompt too
i'll be_back with_my_husband in tow next_time
hands_down_the_best_indian food_i've_had in_the_us
spicy actually means spicy
the samosa's were_fantastic
the_service_was_great
we_had samosa's
garlic_naan
raita
lamb_vindaloo
chicken kadai
the_best dish of_the_night
all_for
unlike most_indian_places
portions_were big enough_to take some home
we probably wont try another place in_las_vegas
seriously good
left_overs didn't last til lunch
had_it for breakfast
super yum
best_part_is its very_clean authentic_indian
not_that greasy chewy stuff you_might get other_places
loved_this_place will def
be_going again
came again after_our initial visit and_we_had_a much_more enjoyable experience
the_server_was friendly_and_attentive this time_around and_kept our_water_glasses full_and answered any questions we_had
i_am addicted to the_chicken_curry
i_didn't_know i_liked indian_food till i_found myself at_home craving the_creamy
flavorful curry_with moist bits_of chicken
mmmmm
i_think_the lunch_buffet is_definitely_worth it at_around since dinner entr es can add up
all_the_other buffet_items are_just bonuses but the_chicken_curry with_garlic_naan are what will keep_me coming_back_for more
hot tip
get the_garlic_naan
way better_than_the regular_naan but make_sure_to place the_order as_soon as you_sit down or they_will bring_out the regular_naan and you_can't order a_new batch till you finish_it haha
modest atmosphere great_food
i_went_with a_couple_of friends while_in sin city
garlic_naan fluffy_and garlicy yum
samosas solid not amazing
mint tamarind chutneys were_really_good
chicken_tikka_masala outstanding
chicken kardai really_good
lamb_vindaloo great_flavor lamb a_bit tough
saag great_flavor
rice nice
owner couldn't have_been nicer
his son even drove us_to the_closest hotel to catch a_cab because_it would_have_been more_than minutes_for one to_come
get off_the_strip and get_some real_indian grub here
thursday lunch
spouse and_i arrived_at about
and were_seated quickly by_a friendly male
the booth had white linen table cloth and white cloth napkins with better_than_the usual flatware and_water goblet
unfortunately
lunch is_only the_buffet_for
it_is_not clear if_this_is all_you_can_eat
a_menu is_only for_dinner
the_buffet_had a
sneeze
shield with sticky notes with handwritten names for whatever was under_the shield
the labels were for the_indian name of_the_dish
not very_helpful if_you're_not an_indian speaker
the
wet
items_were soupy and_the
dry
items_were dry to_an extreme
the_two best items
imho
were the_chicken_curry_and the white_rice
while the_others were forgettable
the condiments i_normally associate with curry
like coconut
peanuts
grated onion
etc
were absent
although_the chutney_was present
but unremarkable as chutney
i_would hazard a guess that those giving five_stars are native speakers and_are familiar with_the_food in_the_buffet
since_i'm neither
this made things awkward
this_place_is_great
the_food_is_excellent and we_were_served by the_owner
he was_very_nice
i talked my_husband into trying a_different cuisine and_he_was weary about_the_place from_the looks on_the_outside
if_it_was not_for_the open sign we probably_would not_have stopped
the_inside is_very_nice
linen on_the tables_and clean
we_are early eaters so_we_were the_start of their_dinner crowd
it filled up quickly as we_ate
we_ordered_the garlic_naan_and it_was_awesome
made_to_order
my_husband_had_the lamb_korma on_my recommendation and_i_had the_chicken_korma
they_also_have_a veggie_korma that_is probably just_as_good
portion_sizes_are large
don't judge_a book_by its cover or you_will miss out_on some_really outstanding indian_cuisine
my_husband liked_it so_much he wants to_go_back before_we leave las_vegas
that does not happen often and means he really liked_it as did_i
this_place_was great
we went_for_the_lunch_buffet on_the recordation of a_friend
it_was_excellent
had never_had sweet_rice before_and it_was_awesome
the_naan was_excellent_and it_was_great to_try a_bunch_of different_dishes
will deffinately be_going back
right_off
i'm_very stingy with giving out stars and i'm_not likely to assign any value to the_outside of_any place
this_restaurant_is not_much to_look_at from the_outside but is_a medium to small_restaurant that_is pleasantly decorated inside with_a friendly_staff
the_lunch_buffet_is served_in some_of_the nicest heated tables
one iced table_for the_cold menu
with covered chafing dishes
the_food_is kept hotter than any_other buffet_with dishes refreshed regularly
the_one meat table is separate from the_vegetable tables
a_nice feature for_vegetarians to_avoid cross contamination
every_dish was_delicious
although i_would_have_liked to have_one main potato dish
there_were potato samosas and_a_great mixed_vegetable dish with_potatoes
and_would drop up_to half_a star_for_the menu selection
the food_was_fresh
perfumed
and not_overly south_indian hot
the obligatory tandoori_chicken_was both flavorful_and moist
i suspect that_the heated tables_and covered chafing dishes help maintain the_quality_of_the_food
the_pakora were_a_little crunchy
maybe not perfect
but_tasty
given_that there_are_no half stars
the_only negatives were_not worthy of dropping to four_stars considering our overall satisfaction
we_arrived for_a_late lunch
around
but_the_food_was great_and refreshed before the_dish_was emptied
keeping the_quality up
the plain_naan arrived before we_were back_from the_buffet_and i_would_have_liked to_have garlic_naan
but no_one asked
i_guess_it is important to_ask right away for naan other_than plain
but_the plain_naan was_good
the_service_was fine with dishes cleared and_water refilled
but_a_little invisible and surprisingly shy
for_any questions
just call out for_them they_really don't_want_to disturb your_meal
overall
the fixtures were superior
the_dining_room was kept clean
and every_dish on_the_buffet was terrific
not_quite the_huge selection found_in some_of_the buffets_in silicon valley
but_it_was all_good
hard_to believe_that any_other_indian buffet in_vegas will beat this_spot for quality_and value
this_is now our go_to_indian restaurant_for vegas
my_husband_and_i must_have gone here_on_a really off day for_them
we_ate at_the ayce lunch_buffet_and i_felt_like we_were_eating their scraps
food_wasn't hot
just warm enough to_eat
the chicken_and_lamb was_dry
they_forgot our drink_orders and_then when_they finally did come_out
they_got our_order wrong
the_food_was_just ok
some_of it_was_not edible though
i_hate wasting food
so_i usually eat_it if i_don't_think it's_the_best
but some_of it
i_just couldn't eat because_it_was either too_dry or_just didn't_taste right
i_hate to_say_it but i_would_never come_back_here again
especially since_we have_found better
lunch_buffet
yummy garlic_naan
one_of_the_best_indian buffets in_vegas_for a_great_price
the_curries_are amazing and_tasty
spices_were phenomenal
from the_outside appearance it_looks_like a
hole in_the_wall
but the_interior was_clean_and pleasant
near strip
i_highly_recommend mt
everest
we_would go_there more often f we lived closer
went in_for_the_lunch_buffet i_believe it_was_like
anyways
food_was_good they could_have filled up buffet a_little_more
as everyone_was taking all_of_the chicken
but_overall very_good
the_decor could use some sprucing up_and cleaning but_overall great_indian at_a good_price with good_service
did a_lot_of yelp searching_for indian_restaurant for_dinner_on our stay here in_las_vegas
that led us here_and we_loved it
environment is delightful
white linen tablecloth
private booth
enjoyed navarattan korma_and paleek paneer and_garlic_naan
mango_chutney
tasty mango_lassi
delicious and_authentic
and_great_service
owner very hospitable
we_loved it
i_visited this_restaurant last_night while in_town on_a business trip based on previous reviewers from yelp
i_was glad_that the outward appearance of_the_restaurant had_been mentioned
as_it may_have kept me_from going in if_i_had just been driving by
once you_enter though
it's_a_great environment with_the white tablecloths and napkins
as_someone dining alone
i_particularly enjoyed the_bollywood playing in the_corner
it kept me entertained while_i_was waiting_for my_food
which_was an_excellent break from_the standard of playing with my_phone
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
which_is my basis for judging a_restaurant
much like pad thai at_a thai restaurant
the_sauce_was amazingly creamy
and_had_a slow burn to_it
which_i find_the hallmark of a_good sauce
i_want the_spice
but_not at_the expense of the_flavor
the_naan_was perfect with_a crispy edge and_soft center
ideal for sopping up the_sauce
but_even more_than the_food
the_service_was phenomenal
everyone is_very_friendly
but give_you your space
my_water never_got below half way full
and_i_can put away water like_a camel
so_that's impressive
and_when_i had a_problem
they_were endlessly gracious and worked with_me while_i figured it_out
few restaurants would_take the_time or effort_to come up_with_a mutually satisfying solution the_way that they_did
end result
if_i_lived here
i'd weigh a million pounds because_i would eat_here all_the_time
as_it_is
i'll_have to settle for stopping in_every time_i'm in_town
well i_knew it would_take something really special for_me_to write my_first ever yelp review and mount_everest india's_cuisine did it
i_have_eaten curry all around_the_world london
new york
los angeles
johannesburg
mumbai and by_far_the best malai_kofta i_have_ever eaten was_right here_at mount_everest in_vegas
perfectly spiced
amazing flavor
exceptional texture
its conveniently just a_few_minutes from_the_strip
very_reasonably_priced
exceptionally friendly_staff and_just great_food
highly_recommended
wow
the_first sign_that mt
everest was_going_to_be a_good restaurant was_the complex scent of spices_that hit our noses
the_next sign was that_it_was crowded
and_most_of the_customers were indian
we_had chicken_curry_and kauli aloo and_found them to_be fragrant
tasty
and freshly prepared
the_garlic_naan_was great
the_staff_was_friendly and_prompt
the_prices_were more_than reasonable
we literally just left this_place
yes
from the_outside appearance you_make be tempted to_pass by
but_i assure you the hospitality and interior setting makes_up_for_it
all the_staff_are wonderful and_attentive but_not_too assertive and_in your_face
oh goodness the_food
we_had_the_chicken masala_and_the chicken_curry
spice_level and we_were_not_disappointed
the_food_was_so delicious_and comforting if that_makes sense
my_wife loves beer_and she_had the taj_mahal which she said went very well_with_the masala
their indian chai_tea was_wonderful as_well
please order the_garlic_naan
so_fresh_and perfectly made
it_was_just an_amazing experience
and_i_am huge on customer_service so_i thank the_staff
please go
myself_and a_bunch_of coworkers go_here for_the_lunch_buffet_and it always pleases
a_decent amount of_options for_a reasonable_price
i've yet to_have_a bad_experience
the_food_is_great and_the_service_is good_too
i_definitely recommend_it
it_was_ok
loved_the_food
but the_customer_service needs a_little work
but_i_will recommend_to olthers
yum
the_first_time_we came_to mount_everest was a_year_ago when_we_were in_vegas
it_was_so_good that when_we came_back to_vegas this year
we put_it on_our list_of things to_do
i'm_still trying_to find an_indian_place in_az that's as_good as this_one
if you're a_fan_of chicken_tikka_masala
you_have_to try_it at mount_everest
it's_the_best that_i_have ever_tasted
and i'm_just sad that_i_have to_come all_the_way to_las_vegas to_get_it
it_was even better_than i_remembered and_i_ate way_too much just_because it_tasted so_good i_didn't_want to_stop eating_it
the_garlic_naan_is also_delicious
the_service_is friendly_and_attentive
and the_location cozy
in_a good way
i_wish_i_could buy the_food_in bulk and ship it_to az
we'll be_back
for_sure
if_you're_in_the vegas_area looking_for great_indian_food
this_is_the_place_to be
great_service by_the friendly_staff and owner and_rich
tasty_food in generous portions
this_food leaves you truly satisfied
not_just full
i've been_there_for lunch and_i've_been there_for_dinner
this_is_my_favorite indian_food_in_las_vegas
the_flavors_are all there
but_it's_not as expensive as many_other indian_restaurants_in_town that i_find to_have less appealing food
as far_as buffets go
their_lunch_buffet_is excellent
they always_have several of_my_favorite_indian dishes available and_they keep the_warm
fresh
pillowy naan_bread coming
the_only_problem i_have is_that_i overeat every_time_i come here_for_the_lunch_buffet
last_night was_my_first_time trying their dinner_menu
and_it_was so_delicious
we started_with vegetable_samosas which_were cooked very_well
the had a_perfect crisp on_the_outside and beautifully seasoned potato filling inside
then for_our_entrees
i_ordered lamb_vindaloo_and my_wife ordered_chicken kurma
and we_both ordered garic naan to_go_with it
unlike many_other indian_restaurants_in_town
mt
everest doesn't charge extra_for rice
i very_much appreciated that
the_lamb_vindaloo was the_best_i've_had
so_flavorful
the kurma was_very_tasty
but_a_little too_sweet for my_tastes
my_wife loved_it though and couldn't_stop raving about_it the_entire meal
she's already mentioned to_me how_much she's looking_forward_to eating her leftovers
somebody in_a previous review seemed_to think the_fact it's_in_a building where a burger_king used_to_be
and in_a predominantly hispanic neighborhood_is a bad_thing
me
i_don't_care where it_is or what used_to_be there as long_as delicious food_and_great_service provided
this_place_has both
the_owner even_brought us_out a_free rice_pudding for_dessert for_us_to try
i_don't_think that's standard for_all guests
but it_was_delicious
i_would_recommend mt
everest india's_cuisine to everybody
my_favorite indian_food_in_vegas
always yummy and_full_of_flavor
service_is usually on_point
the_reason i_took off one_star is brach of the_ambiance
it's_not so_great
it's actually inside of_a converted burger which
while converted
is_still not the_most tranquil setting
also
not_in_the best area_of town
that being_said
i_still love_love love_it and_will continue_to frequent the_place
amazing_food
great_prices
excellent_service
i'd happily come_here again
get_the paneer_pakora
it_is excellent
just_as fantastic as my_last_visit
great_food
flavor was_awesome
spice was_out_of_this_world
my_only suggestion would_be to turn the_a c on
the_warm weather combined with the_spice of_the_food makes for_an uncomfortable visit
lunch_buffet
great_food
service_was mediocre
what with the_owner employee talking on_the_phone while tending customers
but_the_food makes_up_for_it
naan_was_fresh and_soft
a_decent amount of_choices at_the_buffet
but everything_tasted amazing
it_is most definitely worth_the_trip away from_the_strip to_come_here
hands_down_the_best_indian lunch_buffet in_vegas
one in_a_while
they_have_the
carrot pudding
and_it_is amazing
their paneer has_great texture_and in great texture
i_mean it_is soft enough_to absorb flavor_and hard enough_to not break apart
the_chefs at everest know what they're doing
if_your in_vegas_and your at_all a_fan_of_indian_food
stop_here
the_neighborhood is_a_little sketchy and the_place_is an_old fast_food_joint
but be brave
inside it's comfortable and_clean
and_on the_hot day that we_visited it_was cool
we_had_the sample plate that had_a smattering of various indian_dishes
and_all were_very_good
the_owner_and waiter were_very_nice and answered all questions we_had about_the_food
we_will go_again next_time we_are_in town
we_had_a short vacation to_vegas this year_and mt
everest was_the_best thing_that happened_to us
we_had both the_lunch_buffet_and dinner_here and_was one_of_the_best_indian food_places my_wife_and_i have ever_been_to in_the_us
their_naan and_paneer dishes_were made_from scratch and_you_can taste_the fresh_ingredients cooked_to_perfection
service_was_great and_the_owner too was_very_friendly
i_really look_forward_to visit_this_place again on_our next_trip
indian_food lovers this_place_is_a must visit during your vegas trip
best_indian_food and buffet in_las_vegas
a_great_value
we_decided_to_try this_place based on it's_pretty consistent yelp_reviews
and we're glad_we did
a_few reviewers have mentioned the sketchy surroundings
but_i say if_you_can throw some carpet
a_few tablecloths
and_the drapes from an_old bordello into_a defunct burger_king and_come up_with_a perfectly comfortable dining_room
more power to ya
i_have loved indian_food_since i_first discovered it during a brief sojourn in_london
when it_seemed that the_only options were steak and kidney pie or starving to death
i_chose the_latter
valar morghulis
anyway
as_a person_who considers curry to_be more_of_a drug than_a food
i'm usually prepared_to like what_i get_in indian_restaurants
which is_a_little meat floating in_a sea of_delicious sauce_which you happily sop up_with_some fluffy
toasty naan
and fill up_on the_rice
i'm getting hungry again just thinking_about_it
the_difference here_was that_there_was plenty of tender
juicy meat_in that sauce
apparently a_side benefit of keeping the rent low
hope_they don't_get too big for_their britches and move to summerlin
goodbye
meat
i adore chicken_korma_and theirs was_perfect
rich creamy_sauce with just_a_little sweetness and those complex
spicy undertones that keep you coming_back_for more bites long after you're full
chicken_tikka_and tandoori were_both served sizzling and_still moist_and juicy
the favorite appetizer
in_a unanimous vote
was the_lamb samosas
they_were golden little pockets of pastry stuffed_with seasoned
finely ground lamb
but the_best_thing was what wasn't there
my_sister didn't find a_hard thing
mind you
if there_is ground meat involved
be it burgers
sausage
meatballs
whatever
she always gets the hard thing
and_the_rest of_us have_to suffer along_with her
it's_one_of life's little miracles that she_didn't
and practically worth_a sixth star
will_definitely return to_try_the_lunch_buffet
but don't_be surprised if_they raise the_price after our_visit
don't judge_a book_by it's cover
the_outside may appear to have_been_a former fast_food_joint
but inside you will_find a_great_indian_restaurant with a_good_selection_of indian_dishes
lunch_time prices_are_reasonable and_the establishment got pretty busy within minutes_after opening
good_sign
my_wife_and_i were impressed_with_the selection from_the saagaloo
to the_chicken_tika and tika_masala
this_restaurant_is about miles west of_the_strip near palace station casino
the casino where oj finally_got arrested
this_indian_restaurant as_well as taj_palace
located_in henderson
are_my two favorite indian_restaurants
we've been here_for_dinner several_times and_tried out the_lunch_buffet
if you're going for_the_lunch_buffet
try_to plan around traditional lunch times because it_gets busy and_there_is about square feet of waiting area directly in_front_of_the door
that being_said
this_is our_favorite indian_food_restaurant so_far
the_service_is maybe a_little_slow
even_when they_are_not busy
but_the_food_is worth_it
the hubs sticks to the_standard tikka_masala
but we've_had the jel frezi and vindaloo as_well
everything_was fantastic
the_lunch_buffet_is a_great_way_to sample a_bunch_of their foods too
we'll definitely_be going_back_for more
i've never gone here_for_dinner
only for_the_lunch_buffet
if you enjoy eating a_lot_of meat
you'll probably_be disappointed_with_the lunch_buffet
but
that's normal for_most indian_buffets i've_been_to
i_usually only eat the_vegetarian_dishes
the_naan is_better_than most i've tried
it's soft_and thick
rather than_the tortilla bread like naan you_find at_some places
they_also have basic potato samosas_and vegetable_pakora
sadly
i_don't get to_come as often
because_i don't work nearby anymore
we_have_eaten here a_couple_of_times now
their entrees
especially paalak paneer_and tarka dal
taste fresh_and_delicious
garlic_naan_and tandoori roti were_good but_we won't order the_onion kulcha again
also
save your money_and don't_get the aloo_tikki appetizer
the_reason i_am_not giving_them stars_is because we_did_not enjoy our_dinner experience last saturday because the_service went at_a snail's pace and we_waited_for mins between our appetizers_and main_courses
the_manager went around asking how everything_was
but_he had moved on_to the_next table before he hearing our reply
it_was clear that_he was_doing his job half heartedly and_did_not really care_about his customers
the_outside of_the_restaurant does no justice to_the_restaurant
if_i_had not read_the_reviews
we_would turn and drive away
i_have_been_here for buffett and_it_was_pretty good_with a_very_nice lamb_curry
tonight we_are here_for_a take_out
unfortunately we_waited_for over min for_our_food
like_all indian_foods
the potions are surprisingly small during_dinner specially if_you_are used_to indian_buffets
the_quality_of_the_food is_good
overall_i rather go_to_indian when they_have buffett
this indian_food_was soo delicious
it_was_not too_expensive
my_friend_and_i split_a veg thali special and_it was_more_than_enough
so much_flavor
wish_i never_got full so_i_could keep eating
this_was a_nice_little find off_the_strip
we_came for_the_lunch_buffet which_was
person
buffet_items
vegetable_korma
yellow daal
chana_masala
vegetable_samosa
sweet_rice
basmati_rice
vegetable_pakora
chicken_tandoori
chili_chicken
chicken_makhani
chicken_curry
goat_curry_and the_best_part was that_they_had my_favorite gulab_jamun
the_chicken_curry was_very_flavorful
it had_a_great balance_of creaminess and_spices
it_also contained big chunks_of_chicken which_is_what most_people tend_to skimp on
abundance of protein is_always_a plus in_a buffet dish
i_was_surprised that_they_had goat_curry
gamey stuff is_not my cup_of tea so this_one i_did_not try
the_gulab_jamun were little balls of perfection
service
our_server_was very_attentive_and quick to_refill our glass_of_water
i subtracted a_star b c although the_gulab was legit
they_only_had the_gulab and_rice_pudding for_dessert
there_was no mango pudding or_the carrot_halwa the_sweet carrot dessert
but_i_guess you_can't have everything
i_also wasn't a_fan_of their_naan that they_offered
a_good naan has a_little_bit_of crispiness and_some flavor
this naan had no_flavor whatsoever and_was_very thick_and heavy
it_was more_of_a pita than_a naan
for
i_would_come again
my_favorite biryani spot
i_had visitors in_town so we_came_here for_dinner
as_always
prakash was_amazing
even though he_was busy entertaining the_other guests
he came_by to_check on_us
we_had lamb_biryani chicken_biryani last_night
it_was_delicious
we_enjoyed it_to_the max
the_chai masala was_yummy too
i've_been_here so many_times_and their food_has always_been the_best
my_friends was happy_with_the dishes ordered
i_would_recommend all my_friends to_come have buffet lunch_or_dinner at mount_everest india's_cuisine
thanks for_being awesome
it was_my_first_time having_indian_food so_i was_excited_to_try mount_everest
i went_for_dinner with_a_group_of people
we_didn't make_a_reservation but_they_were still able to_accommodate us pretty quickly
we_ordered paneer_pakora and chicken_pakora as appetizers
both which were_really_good
they_also offered free papadom along side the_appetizers
most of_us ordered_chicken entrees
all which were_pretty delicious
a_friend_of_mine ordered_the prawn vindaloo which i_really_liked
the_dishes_were rich_and spicy and_there_was enough where_we could share with each_other
i_would_definitely come_back
the_prices_were good and_the_staff_was attentive_and_friendly
the_only_thing_that got me is_that i_thought_the restaurant would_be bigger than_i_expected but other_than_that
i_liked mt
everest
dive into_this incredible buffet bucks
star i_love_indian
and_they do_it really_great here
and you_cannot beat the_price
small place_in_the ghetto
sahara and valley view
not_too ghetto
but_still
its_not pretty on_this corner
but inside
you forget about_it quick when_you start salivating at the_door
and running to_the_buffet like_a wild animal ready_to eat yourself silly
take_a breath
its ok
this_place_will give_you everything you_need
every_indian spice_is in something
the_quality_and freshness is stellar
hightly recommended
just see the_other_reviews
dont take_my word for_it
try_it and_take you own word
its amazing
we had_dinner one_night and came_back a_few_days later for_the_lunch_buffet
both were_excellent
we've tried_a_few other_places on_the_strip but this_place_is far better
worth_the short side trip
one_of_the_best_indian_restaurants i've_been_to_in a ling time
service_was fast courteous_and friendly
food_was authentically delicious
the_selection_of really_good indian_restaurants_in_las_vegas is somewhat limited
but thank goodness for mount_everest
from the_outside it_looks_like a converted fast_food_joint
used_to_be_a burger_king
but inside the_decor_and atmosphere are what you_would_expect in an_authentic upscale indian_restaurant offering fine_dining
to cut a_long story short
i_have_eaten_at mount_everest on several occasions
the_food_is_excellent as is_the_service
portions_are generous_and the prices_are_very_reasonable
i_have_tried many_indian_restaurants in_vegas_and none_of them come close_to mount_everest highly_recommended
i_feel drunk after_dinner not because_of drinks but_with all_the_great spices they_have on_the food
we_had chicken_tikka_masala_and prawn vindulo with_garlic_naan
the_flavors_were all great especially the_masala
i_think_it's the_best one i've ever_tasted
the portion_size was_also just_right compared_to the_other_indian restaurants_i've_been too
the_only_downside is_the_service that's why i'm_giving it_stars
the_servers_were very_nice but_they_were short handed
they_need more_people there
we_will_be_back for_sure
if_you_like_indian_food
this is_the_place_to_go in_vegas
pleasant atmosphere
waiters are_very_friendly
and_the_food
first
he naan_bread_is the_best_i ever_had_in the usa or europe
i_had_a chicken_korma
it_was_perfect
creamy
delicate and a_big portion
love_this_place
will_be_back soon
great_food
good vibes
the_onion bread_was off_the charts
go for_lunch_and enjoy the_buffet
the_samosas
oh the_samosas
food_is_really_good but dinner portions to_go are tiny
i spent on my_favorite cauliflower dish_that_was really small_and half of_it_was potatoes
highly disappointed_by_the portion_size considering how_much it costs and_that you_can_have all_you_can_eat at the_lunch_buffet_for the_price_of small dinner dish
best bet is_just to_go for_the_lunch_buffet unless_you have extra money to_spend on multiple dinner dishes
we spent on dinner_for about the_same amount_of_food we eat_at_the lunch_buffet
maybe i'm_just a gluttonous pig
after seeing_the great reviews_on_yelp
i_decided_to_try out mount_everest india's_cuisine
i_had never_tried_indian_food before
and_wanted to_try_something_new for_dinner so_i brought along my two buddies for_the ride
upon arriving
we_were_greeted with quick and_prompt service
which_was_a very big plus in_my_book
all_the workers there_were very_kind
and quickly assisted us_with whatever we_needed
my_friends_and i_wanted_to_try different_things and_share
so we_ordered_a prawn curry
chicken_biriyani
garlic_naan
and_a very_very spicy chicken_biriyani
when_the_food arrived
i_felt_like i_was_in heaven
everything smelled so_good and looked so_flavorful
i immediately started_to dig in
the_garlic_naan_was amazing
and_felt like_it just melted in_my_mouth
i_even ordered another round because it_was_so_good
the prawn curry_was the_right_amount_of spicy_for_me and very_delicious
it_was big enough for_us_to split between people
the chicken_biriyani was_very_flavorful and_had tender chunks_of_chicken mixed inside
it_was_definitely something_i would_order again
my_first trip to_an_indian_restaurant was a_good_one
i_hope to_come_back sometime soon and try_out something new
mt
everest has amazing_food
i_came_here for_the
buffet and_was amazed at the_quality_of_food
the_servers_were also very_attentive
the_buffet_had authentic indian_pakistani food that_would rival any_other indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
will_definitely be_back_again
this_was_a really great_place_to_go with_my bestie
we_love to_try lots_of things_and at the_lunch_buffet price who could argue
it_is_a small_place and_i wondered how come there_wasn't_a line to_eat this yumminess
we_went around_pm to_miss the_lunch rush
i_think_we did right
can't_wait_to go_back
i'm_a indian_food lover and_had_a indian craving while on mini vacay in_vegas
stumbled upon this_place on_yelp_and due_to_the great_reviews i_decided_to give_this_place_a shot
we_were_greeted and_sat immediately
the_food_on_the buffet looked pretty_good so_we_went with_that
oh boy
what a_good life decision that_was
just_about everything_i put on_my_plate was above_average in_flavor
usually at an_indian_buffet there_are at least items_that get left on_my_plate
not_here
the_only_thing_i didn't_care_for was the_potato samosas
and_that's strictly due_to_the too thick
not crispy pastry surrounding the well_spiced potato filling
the_butter_chicken_was good
made_with a_mix_of white and dark meat
and had_a_nice deep flavor throughout the_chicken_and sauce
the_paneer palak was_wonderful and_flavorful with_a kick of chilies
my_partner in crime enjoyed_the veggie_korma greatly
as did_i
it_was creamy
with well rounded flavors_and tasted very unique compared_to other veggie kormas i've_had
heck it put mine to shame
they_didn't shy away from spice or heat as_some indian_places do to adapt to american palates and_i dig them for_it
service_was_a_bit_slow
plates weren't cleared as fast as_i would've liked them to_be
and my_water_glass was parched a_few_times but_i'll cut them some slack for_being a_bit short staffed the_day_we went
overall it_was_great
been_back pretty much once_a_week and_everything is_good as_always
food_is_always hot_and_fresh and_never dried out
prakash always gives me extra paneer when they're out
nice guy
great_food
and_better yet
great_service
a_great alternative if_you_want_to get_away from_the_strip
trust_me i_was skeptical at_first
like_you
who_is currently reading this
th wall
but_it_was worth_the risk
excellent_indian_food
saw_the previews
went to_try_it_out last_night
good was_good_but the_price_was kinda high compared_to the taste_of_the_food
overall
it_was_great
i_used_to dislike ethnic cuisines
thats when_i_was stupid
now that_i_have more food_experience indian_food is_one_of_my new faves
love_love love
this_place_is_amazing
i'm completely addicted to_their garlic_naan_and braised goat
just delish
i_never liked indian_food_before and_this_place changed my_mind completely
you_must try_everything here
the_spices and sauces_are perfect
had_a dinner_for_two here during a_weekday and_ordered their mount_everest thali special for
it_was just_the_right_amount_of food_for heavy eaters like us but_would probably_be too_much_for the_average appetite
the_quality_is above_average and_quite enjoyable
kinda like good home cooking
the_restaurant_was quite clean_and the_service_was_friendly and_prompt despite_the restaurant being more_than half occupied
i_can't recommend getting their thali combos enough
it's_like getting_a tasting menu_as you'll get quite a_good_variety_of staple indian_dishes
overall
i'd eat_here again
you_get so_much eating satisfaction for_the money
great_indian_food
the_owners it's_always welcoming
family_owned and pops are in_the_kitchen
authentic
affordable and_great overall
cheese and_peppers dish
lamb_curry and_the winner
naan
awesome authentic_indian_food
we_were bunch_of indian guys who are_very finicky about_indian_food
after_a_long tiring weekend
we_wanted_to have indian_food to energize
it_is_the most authentic_indian_food that_you_can taste
i_usually judge the_restaurant through their yellow dal
dal fry
dish as that_is_the most basic dish
it_was simply amazing
i_loved all_the vegetarian_options for_sure
would_definitely go_there if i_am_in_vegas again
another favorite in_vegas definitely the_best_indian in_town
i've_been_to the_lunch_buffet_and the a_la_carte dinner
while the_buffet_is certainly worth_the_price i_love coming for_dinner so that_i can_order exactly_what_i want
the_garlic_naan is_a_must
and_i recommend_it with_some plain yogurt on_the side
for main_courses i_really_love the_lamb
or vegetable
korma_and the_chicken_tiki_masala
i_get both on medium
level and it_still has_a_good amount_of_spice
i'd say those two sauces_are my_favorites since_i've tried others that_are not_as memorable to_me
i_don't love the_chicken_tikka but probably only because_i'm a_big sauce girl
i_also really_enjoy the_okra vegetable dish
full_of_flavor
though_the talk of slow_service is_true i'd say the_food_is too good to_pass up_and don't mind the_service
i_also_like to_finish my_meal with_a chai_tea at_the_end
overall great_place eating so_many delicious spices just makes me_feel very_warm and calm on_the_inside i_would_definitely consider this
comfort_food
just delicious
i_can't handle too_much spice_and this had_just the_right_amount
there_was such a_variety_of foods at_the lunch buffett
for
you can't_go_wrong
and the_staff_were so_friendly
great_lunch_buffet
loved_their malai_kofta
and their_service cannot be beat
the_owner_is such_a nice gentleman
he let us stay past closing as we_waited_for a_cab to_come get us
my_only critique is_that_it isn't closer_to the_strip_and therefore isn't as easy_to_get to
more_people need_to make_this a stop on_their trips_to vegas
great food_and_great_service
love_this_place
awesome lunch_buffet
don't_let_the outside fool_you
this_place_is nice
food_is_fresh
good
service great
ayce indian_lunch_buffet review
from_the first bite
bam
more spices
a_little_more heat
and_much more_flavor than all_the_other lunch_buffets i've_been_to so_far
indian_food_is like thai food to_me
the more_spicy it_is
the_better it_tastes
you_get much_more flavor_and depth in_the curries_and misc
so_it's much_more enjoyable
and_the_garlic_naan of_course
the_most
garlicky
i've_had
so much_flavor
yum
i_think_we ate three baskets while_we_were here lol
super cheap prices
gonna be_hard to beat at only
weeeee
pics
i_went_there for_a_lunch_buffet with_a_group_of people during our_visit to_las_vegas
food_was_decent
being an_indian
i_would_expect the_items_on_the buffet to_be little_bit hot_and spicy
but_it_wasn't the_case here
some_of_the dishes_were sweet with_little or no salt
that_is_the reason i_gave it_stars
the_garlic naans served was_great
the_kheer
gulab_jamun and_sweet honey rice were_good
overall_i recommend_it
will_definitely visit the_next_time_i come_to visit vegas
their_lunch_buffet_is amazing
truly an_amazing deal_and you're really getting wonderful_food at such_a_great price
when_i_arrived a_few_minutes after my_friend
we already had a_basket_of fresh_naan and waters
the_naan_was fluffy
tasty
crispy
and just_so scrumptious
the_selection_was awesome
the dishes_that stood out_for me_were the_basmati_rice
vegetable_korma
vegetables in creamy_sauce
vegetable_samosa
baked pastry with spiced potato mix
and_tandoori_chicken
roasted chicken marinated with_spices
my absolute favorite_dish had_to_be the_chicken_makhani
chicken_in creamy tomato based gravy
oh_my goodness
it_was_so
so_delicious
amazing flavor_and it went_well with everything
the_naan
rice
and_even the_samosas
i_really_liked_the samosas as_well because_the pastry was_extremely tasty_and wonderfully crunchy
the_potato mixture inside was_also delightful
we_also_tried the_chicken_curry_and goat_curry
both prepared_with the respective meats
tomatoes
and_spices
good
but overshadowed by_the amazing makhani
the_aloo baingan
eggplant with_potatoes
was_tasty_and prepared very_well
but_not something i_loved
the_last item i_tried was the_chili_chicken
chicken with_garlic
green chili
and_onion
but_i_didn't like_it
plus
it_was way_too spicy_for_me
service was_really_great too
our waters were refilled quickly_and frequently
we_also received a_naan refill promptly
i_was extremely pleased with the_whole experience
this_is seriously great_food_and i_can't_wait_to_go_back
too hyped up
service_was slow
food_was_not super hot
at a_level
i_couldn't taste any spicy ness
vegetable khorma was_good
tikka massala could've been_better
i_do have to_say_that the_garlic_naan_and the_raita were_amazing
i_miss la indian_food
i_have now been to_this_place times for_their_lunch_buffet
i_can't give_this_place stars
but_they_are better_than stars
a
is_what i'd truly rate this_place
the vegetarian_options are_delicious
don't know all the_names but i_can_say_that what_i ate was_definitely tasty
the_best dish
however is_a toss up between their chili_chicken and_rice_pudding dessert
for very_different reasons each_dish is_tasty
the_chili_chicken has heat and_a delectable blend_of_spices
the_rice_pudding is_just sweet enough and_a refreshing end to a_meal filled_with spicy goodness
if_you're_a fan_of_indian cuisine or first timer
i'd suggest_you try_this_place
there_is something_for everyone
and if_it counts for_anything
my_indian coworker says mt_everest is_better_than mint_and india marsala
not_bad at_all
food_was_not spicy_enough
usually_a out_of is spicy_for_me
we_had_to add hot_sauce
fairly priced
decent_food
the_only_one
i_wanted_to stray from cuisine i_was already familiar_with
so_i grabbed a_handful_of friends_who were up for_something new_and came_here after_looking at_some reviews
it was_our_first_time trying_indian_food
and_i_have_to_say
i_do quite like_it
an lunch_buffet_is a_great_price
there's a_lot_of room in_there
and_there_is variety in_the_dishes from_what_i can tell
i spooned a_little_bit_of_everything on_my_plate and nearly everything_i tried i_was a_fan_of
the_naan came
and_the_garlic_naan was_as_good as everyone on_yelp had said
my_friends were_also fans of the_sweet_rice
i_think_it paired perfectly with the_chicken_curry
the service_was_awesome
too
being first timers
they_were_all very_helpful
they_made more sweet_rice for_us even_when they_were around minutes away from closing and_didn't hesitate_to let us_know what_the fennel was_for by_the entrance
lol
overall
this_place_is_a great_experience for_those who want to_try_it
i like_this_place
everything_is fresh
the_restaurant_is clean
and_the_prices_are reasonable
i_would_definitely_recommend them
lunch_buffet_was good can't say_it_was the_best_indian_food_i ever_had but_good
we_got_there around saturday afternoon waited for_a_table just a_few_minutes
every thing was_good is_it possible foods were heavier than other_indian_restaurants
i_thought_the foods were heavier
they_did_not serve garlic_nan just regular nan disappointed a_little_bit
i_would_recommend_this_place good_place_for something different but i_don't_think_i would_come_back soon
great_value
great_food
friendly people
defiantly worth stopping in if_you_are up_for an_indian_lunch_buffet
my_favorite neighborhood food
always on_point with deliciousness and a_smile
great great great_food_and really reasonable_prices
the_buffet_is a go_to
and they_are_open late
and_they_have they buffett everyday
boom
this_is_the_place for_a_great indian_lunch_buffet
there were_a_lot_of excellent vegetarian_options
chicken_and really_good fresh garlic_nan
also_a very_friendly host who took good care_of us
i'll look_forward_to lunch here_again
this_place_was awesome
seriously as_good_as_it gets
especially out_in middle_of nowhere las_vegas
super authentic
great_food
and gigantic portions
very simple establishment and totally_worth it
you totally get what_you_pay for_at mount_everest
get the_samosa chat
thank me later
if_you_are an_indian_food lover
the_smell when_you_walk into what surely was once a_fast_food chain will slap you in_the face and get_your mouth_watering
the_menu will only frustrate
as everything looks great
i_went_with the_vindaloo
lamb
an order_of_naan
and glass_of merlot
the merlot was about_what you_can expect for
the_naan_was a scoach undercooked and bland
the_vindaloo_was damn near perfect
the_waiter simply asked_if_i like_spicy
no number game
and the_dish_was the just the_right_amount to_get_your tongue tingling
but_not overwhelming
sure the_decor maybe flavorless and_the_staff unprofessional
a busser assistant in_a stocking hat
but_the spices_are dead on
i_plan many 'o follow up at_the summit of everest
absolutely fantastic_food best indian_food_i've_ever_had
and_i've had_a_lot
not knowing what some_of_the items_were
i_asked and_the_owner himself
pravat or_something like_that hard_to remember foreign names my bad
came_over_and answered everything to_a tee
my_family and_i_are in_lv once_a year_and will_certainly be_back in
delicious
with excellent selection
don't_let_the exterior fool_you
the_food_is_amazing
without_the reviews_on_yelp we may_have drove right by
my_husband_and_i went to_have_some dinner_and we_didn't realize the_time
the_restaurant_was actually closed and_the_owner prakash welcomed us and_gave us the_option to_order take_out
we_really appreciated that
and_we_were worried that his staff would_be upset with_us for ruining their closing routine
prakash was_so_nice and_he took_our_order and we_even ordered extra sides after we_had put the_original order in
and_he still accommodated us
we_will_definitely come_here again within hours when we_are_in town next_time
the_food_was_amazing spicy and_fresh
we absolutely_loved it
chicken_vindaloo is_incredible
the_manager gave_us_a great personal touch and recommended dinner
we_tried both the_cheese and_garlic bread
and my_friend_had chicken_makhani
the_vindaloo melted in_my_mouth and_the makhani sauce was_superb over_rice
incredible place to_have my_first_time eating_indian_food
came for_dinner_and had both the_garlic_naan_and the_cheese_naan
both_were amazing and_moist
fresh out_of_the oven
had also chicken_makhani and chicken_vindaloo
the_chicken_makhani was sweet to_the taste_and saucy
the_chicken_vindaloo was mild but_just the_right kind of_spicy kick for_me
both sauce is_great_for dipping the_naan
i_highly_recommend_this restaurant
i_drove all away from utah to_have their_chicken_tikka_masala with_garlic_naan
incredible
best combination_of spices i_have_ever tasted
not_only was the_food amazing but_the_service_was incomparable
i_will_be making_the trip just for_this_restaurant
you_won't_be sorry
i'm no indian_food expert but_you_can stamp my_indian_food non expert seal of approval for mount_everest
it_is_an all_you_can_eat indian_buffet with_all sorts of_indian_dishes for_just
believe_me when this very_reasonable price_of
is_worth way more_than the_price you_pay
each time i've_been_here for_lunch it's_been packed_with people spilling out while waiting_for tables to free up
there's even not a_lot_of parking
most_of_the time these_are good signs of_how delicious a_place is and_this_was the_case here
is_it authentic_indian
i_wouldn't know but a_few_of my vo workers from_india like them too
though_i haven't seen others from_india dine here_at the_same_time as me
i_never asked_what a dish_was or what's inside so all i_can_say is_that_i enjoyed them_all
the_green stuff
the orange stuff
the yellow and brown stuff
the stuffed bread stuff
and the_fried battered stuff
all very_delicious
they_were labeled but_i_don't remember_what each was_because i_usually sample them_all
there_was_a red chicken
not to_be mistaken for char sui
and_another meat dish
ask_for the_garlic_naan
the freshest right out_of_the oven
the_better
they_do_have non buffet options
it use to_be_a burger_king so imagine that kind of space on_the_inside and they_have_a tv playing films from_india
customer_service_is usually fast_and friendly so the_only_reason that i_think there's_a long_wait is because_they_are very_good_and those there first are enjoying the goods
worth_the_trip off_the_strip
the_curries here are_so_good
my only_complaint_is_that i_wish_the free naan_that they_give with the_buffet_was garlic_naan instead_of plain
but_the plain_naan was_delicious too
i_will_be sure to_come_back during_my next trip_to_vegas
i_went_here seeing
stars at yelp
this_restaurant_is not_even star
food_is terrible_service is worst
they_offer only plain_naan
neither rotis nor garlic_naan
appetizers samosas pakoras_were not fresh
must_be previous days left_overs
do yourself a_favor and_go to_mint for_a satisfying indian_buffet
tried_this last_night
found on_yelp_and have_to agree_with reviews
great_food service_was wonderful_and very well_priced
how you_could buy a_burger when this_place_is around
this_is_a place my_wife_and_i keep going_back_to
such great_food_and the people_are very_nice
a usual place of_mine
this_place serves great_food
we highly_recommend coming_here during their lunch_hour for_the_buffet so_that you_can_try a_variety_of food_and save a_lot_of money
what_i did find rather funny and unusual was_a conversation i_had with the_waiter
i_asked_for garlic butter naan_and_the way he answered the question and what_he said was_really weird
it_wasn't until after my_boyfriend_and_i left that_i laughed about_it
he said they_weren't making garlic_naan because if they_did
people would_come to_their restaurant_and it'll be too_busy
haha isn't_that what_you_want
then_he kept going and_said
we're going_to continue serving it after_the holidays
and_we don't_have it_because it_takes too_long to_make
hahaha i_didn't understand all_the excuses
so_i just said
it's_all right
not_a_big deal
although i_was_a_little disappointed they_didn't_have the_garlic butter naan because_i always_order it when_i_go to_an_indian_restaurant
had_a craving_for_indian_food and mount_everest was recommended_by my cab driver
started off_with_a chicken_tikka plate that_came out looking great because_it_was sizzling but_after a closer inspection
i_noticed it_was doused in red color dye and_no marination or flavor
i_then had_some butter_chicken which_had too_much spice_and not_enough flavor
i did_enjoy the_naan_bread however which_was fluffy_and soft
needless_to say i_did_not take the_leftovers
the_tandoori_chicken
yellow curry_and naan is_great
i'll be_back
girlfriend brought_me here_at
just minutes_before they close the_buffet
normally i_would_never go_to_a buffet right before_they close because_of_the poor food choices that_are left but this_is_not_the case
all_the food_was_still being replaced and hot_and ready
the_chicken_curry_and sweet_rice were especially delicious
price_is cheap too
only
for_a indian_buffet for kings
yes please
will_definitely recommend_to friends_and return_for more
decent_food
better_than most indian_restaurants_in_vegas
service is_ok
food isn't oily
i_don't why this hotel is rated high
it's_a pathetic restaurant
actually i_am right_now in_the_restaurant
they_have_a buffet_lunch
once_i took the_curries i_was_told i will_get the_naan but_i had_to_wait mins until i_went and ask_for it_again
atmosphere sucks
i_would better have_gone to_some gas station and_got pringles
lunch_buffet_was fabulous
a_good number and variety_of_dishes to_choose_from
friendly_and_attentive staff as_well
must_try if_you_like_indian
superb
this food_was_so full_of_flavor and_the_owner and_his son were wonderful hosts
we_were in_vegas_for my birthday and_i was_craving_indian_food so_i looked on_yelp_and found mount_everest
when_we first arrived we_were_greeted with a_smile and seated_right away
just by reading the_menu we knew we_were_in for an_amazing food_experience
we_ordered somosa
chicken_tikka_masala
and tandori_chicken
the food_was_absolutely outstanding
the_spices and_flavors were_a_little spicy_but too good_to not_eat
since we_left vegas i_have_been craving the_same experience but have_not been_able_to find something remotely close
literally
the_best_indian_food_i've_ever had
i_went_to_this restaurant after checking_out yelp and_i_am pleasantly_surprised
they_have great_food_and the_owner_was really_friendly
since we_came_in on new year's day
he_gave the ladies in our_party roses
which was_so_nice
the_green chutney was_spicy_and delicious
garlic_naan_was also_delicious
best ones i've ever_tasted
i_would_definitely come_back when_i'm back in_town
great ayce indian_food for_the_price and_i_will_be going back soon
there_was_a constant stream of_people coming in_for_the_lunch_buffet so you_may have_to plan ahead if_you_don't have_a_lot_of time
for a_small buffet it had_a_great mix_of sweet
savory
and_spicy flavors
everyone in_my group left satisfied
absolutely_amazing food
great_service
better_than a_lot_of_the curry_houses in_town
the place_is_clean_and the_staff_is_friendly
i watched a woman hand dry the_dishes after they_were washed one by one
it shows they care
please visit and_enjoy
i'm very_picky when_it_comes_to food from_my culture
especially in_vegas because there_are_so few options_for good_indian_food
my first_time_here
and_in between my nd and rd plate
i_have_to_say it_has hit_the_spot
all_the_food is_extremely flavorful_and hits every part_of palette
the curry_chicken
tandoori_chicken_and butter_chicken with the_butter naan are_delicious
squeeze a_little lemon and_your good to_go
the_service_is_good and_everyone is_very_friendly
i_will_be coming_back_here for_the_lunch_buffet_and this_place_has instantly become my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in town
this_is_a review for_the_lunch_buffet
i_have_not been there_for_dinner
wow
i_was_a_little surprised
i_had_heard so_many good_things
perhaps this_was just an
off
day for_their_lunch_buffet
let me explain that we_were_not treated badly
we_were just ignored for the_most_part
i_tried almost_everything on_the_buffet and_i enjoy eating_indian_food and_was looking_forward_to lunch here_since the_day before since i_had_never been
that_said
i_have_been_to several different indian_places here in_town_and after_reading other_reviews i_didn't_know exactly what_to_expect
the_service_was barely there_and_the lunch_buffet
about an_hour and a_half into service
was messy
the steam table_was occasionally being
refilled
instead_of changed out
at least
theoretically
the_food that_was there_at the_beginning would only last till the_end_of_the lunch hours
there_were_a_few other cleanliness issues but_i'll leave it at_that
the tap water served_in the cloudy glass could_not be overlooked
the_items_on_the lunch_buffet itself
some overcooked
were_just okay at_best
other_items bear only slight resemblance to_the preparations i've_had at other_indian_places
i really_do enjoy indian_food and_i_really went into_this wanting_to like_this_place
there_are a_lot_of indian_lunch_buffets in_las_vegas_and if_you_have the means to_go_to a_different one
sigh
go
phenomenal service
extraordinary food
and_a spot in_las_vegas that no_one knows about
i bring my asian
white
and hispanic friends here all_the_time
and every_time
they_are amazed by_this culture
any restaurant that_can impress all cultures is_an extremely rare thing
three key elements
food
reason being is_because the_food_here_is diverse and encompasses all common aspects of_indian_food
unfortunately
most_places offer one or_two specialities
and_the_rest is bland
ever dish at_mt
everest_is a speciality because_i can't find any_other place_with better_food
no grease
no fuss
and_lots_of variety
for_under for_a_lunch_buffet
their fresh baked bread i_could_eat all by itself
service
the_owner himself
pradesh
was walking around_to greet
and serve the_customers
any owner that_is willing to clean_and pick up dishes
is_a phenominal manager in_my name
and_i_have worked in_food industry as_a floor manager for_years
extremely_friendly
and sincere
two_things that_are rare in this_world
authenticity
my best friend is_very native to_india and_a wealthy person
he chooses this_place over fine_dining restaurants every_time he visits me
there's nothing more to_say
this_place_is_the only indian_restaurant_that will sincerely and fully impress you
charles
love_the_food and personnel at_this_restaurant
they_always make_it as hot as_i want_it this_is
in_my_opinion the_best_indian_restaurant_in vegas
i_wish it_was closer_to our home so_we_could go more often
fabulous food
friendly_staff and_no gimmicks
this_place is_by_far_the_best_indian in_vegas
choose how hot you_want your_food with being_the hottest on_the scale
hubby loves_the jalfrezi at but we_have_a tikka at
coming_from the_uk we_are used_to great_indian_food
mount_everest does not_disappoint
come_here very often
good_service
good_food
at good_price
i_like shahi_paneer and mutter_paneer
we were_out_of towners in_vegas_for new years who_were craving_indian_food
we decided_to_go to_mt
everest and_my gosh
we absolutely_loved it
the_buffet_had great_vegetarian and_meat selections
every_dish in_the_buffet tasted different_than the_last one_and had_so much_flavor
i_am indian
so_i_know my_indian_food
this_place really reminded me_of home_cooked food
the_owner_and the_servers_were really attentive_and made_sure we_always had naan_and water on_our_table
they cleared out plates as_soon_as_we were_done
because_it_was new years
the_owner came and gave_me and_my_friend a rose stem each and wished us_a happy new year
it_was_a_great gesture
and_no he wasn't hitting on_us
we_were_there with_our husbands
he_was genuinely a_really_nice person and they_get an_a in_food as_well as customer_service
excellent food_and_service with_a_big smile
i_had_the vegetable thali
what a_great_way_to sample the_wonderful food_here
i_highly_recommend
they_also offer a_nice beverage selection including wine
go and_enjoy
i_was wondering if part_of my less than
a_ok
experience_was the result of dining alone
i_often find_that single diners don't_get the_same quality_of service_as larger parties i've_always thought that_this_is due_to_the lower expected tip who knows
in_this case i_ordered an_appetizer
soup
and main course
but the_soup came out first_and while_i_was about spoonfulls into_the soup
the_appetizer and main course arrived
of_course
by_the_time i_got to the_main_course it_was cold
when the_manager visited the_table to_ask me how things_were
i_told_him how the_food had_been served and_his response was_to smile and walk_away
otherwise
the service_was_prompt and_pleasant
i_had lamb filled samosa for appetizer which_was overcooked_and the_meat dried out
the dahl
lentil_soup
was watery_and tasteless
and_the dish_of lamb_curry had_about small chunks_of meat hidden_in a_lot_of sauce
for extra i_got about tablespoons of_chutney and_another for_an equal amount of spiced pickles
the_best_part_of the_dinner was the_onion stuffed naan
mount_everest could_be mistaken
both inside_and out
for_a fast_food_joint
except_for_the white cloth napkins and tablecloths
again
if stars means a_ok
then this_place should be stars_for just_ok
amazing food_and_the_service outstanding
they owner even provided us free dessert_and called us a_cab to_get back_to_the hotel
by_the_time_we finished our dessert the cab was_ready for_us outside
my_girlfriend_and my year old mom from italy loved_it
thank_you for a_great_meal
a charming restaurant that_was easy_to_get to
and a_lovely experience_for the_whole family
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
tandoori grill and_chicken_curry are_amazing
this_restaurant_is a_gem
wow
best_indian_food by far
everything tastes good and_fresh
from_the main_courses to_the soups
its a_bit heavy but you_must order_a naan_bread when_you_are there
it complements the_meal very_well
food_was_ok
probably won't be_back
nothing_special
mint_indian_bistro is_better
i_was_pleasantly_surprised
the_location_is a_bit ghetto so_i wasn't expecting the_great food_and_service
the_dinner was seasoned_and cooked just_right
next_time i'll try_the_lunch_buffet
this_place_is just_okay
there_are many rave reviews
and i_feel_like i_may be missing something
i_will give_it another shot if_i am in_the_area
but i_don't_see myself driving out_of_the way to_eat_here
their_buffet_is fairly limited and most_of_the_food lacked any spice factor
it_was_almost bland and_some_of it_was overcooked
my_favorite part_was the_rice_and the_naan
i_did finish my small plate_and had_no desire for_seconds
the_meats were fatty and low quality_and the_buffet_was not_exactly cheap at
tip
the_owner seems_like a_nice gentleman and recognized my_friend who worships this_place
the_service however was close_to non existent and toward the_end we_felt rushed
i_am a_fan_of_indian_food and_have sampled several places around_town
and_this would_probably stack somewhere in_the_middle
i_would_be interested in trying their_dinner items to_see_how they stack up in_that category
overall
just an okay indian_buffet with not_much separating it_from the_rest_of_the pack other_than the_owner who seems_to care_about his return patrons
my craving_for_indian_food comes once in_a blue moon
and_finally that blue moon was shining so bright
nah
just kidding
but_as far_as i_can remember
the_last times we've_had indian_food_was the cmyes at_namaste and_mint
walking to india_masala after helping set_up for_the_first nerdy dancing and_most recently
apps at mantra_masala which_was okay
this called for_a visit that_was long overdue
so_we scrolled down the_list and picked the_highest rated place_in_town which_was mt
everest
at
for_a_lunch_buffet of a_pretty_good spread that_would please just_about any palate
basmati and sweet_rice
jhukuni aloo
vegetable_samosas
punjabi kadi
palak_paneer
mattar_paneer
gajar halwa
chicken_curry
goat_curry
chili_chicken
chicken_makhani
tandoori_chicken
salad_bar
assorted chutneys
naan
and_rice_pudding
i_tried every offering once
then went_back_for seconds and thirds of_my_favorites
the_sweet_rice
goat_curry
punjabi kadi
and_both paneer dishes
honestly one_of_the best lunch deals in_town
service_was_great
water_glasses and our_naan basket was replenished quickly
and_you_can watch and listen to_some bollywood action while enjoying your_meal
looking_forward_to returning
and this_time
no need to_wait_for that blue moon
aloha
shaka meter
uuu uuu uuu uuu uu
yelp challenge
bomb bites and bollywood beats
we_decided to_give_it_a_try for my_friends birthday after_reading lots_of positive_reviews here on_yelp
and upon arrival we_were_seated_immediately
everyone else's food smelled so_good when_we first walked_in
i_was_really_excited
even_though_i don't typically care for_indian_food
we_ordered_a bottle_of_wine and_a_few various dinners and_naan
which we_did wait a_little while_to actually receive
but_it_was so worth_the_wait
everything_was amazing
i had_the_chicken_tikka_masala
which i_would surely order again
the_owner_was also there making sure_that everything_was perfect
he even_brought my_friend out dessert for_her birthday
we_will_definitely make_the trip back across town to_eat_here again
the_food_here_is incredible
i've been probably times_now_and have_never_been disappointed
the_customer_service is_great
and_makes the_meals all_the better
i'll be_back as often as i_can
the_owner
prikash
sp
consistently goes out_of his way to_make_the dining_experience even_better
this_is_the bomb indian_food buffet
i_eat here_at_least once every_week or_two
the_food_is_excellent
always_fresh
and the_management is_very_friendly
would_definitely suggest this_restaurant to_anyone_who enjoys fine indian_food
hands_down_the_best_indian cuisine in_vegas
plakat paneer
spinach home_made cheese
brings back incredible memories of_indian town in singapore
doesn't get_any more_authentic than_this
and_you_can beat_the
lunch_buffet price
great customer_service
i_had surgery yesterday and my_husband_had promised to_take me_to mt_everest afterwards i_was starving
we_were running late and_i called at
and begged them_to place_a carry_out order
they close at
they saved the_day
and_let us pick up our_order right after_they closed
great fresh_food
with just_the_right_amount_of spice
they_will kick it up_to however hot you_want no problem
of_all_the_indian nepal buffets i've_been_to
this_is_the least salty_and greasy
the_taste
did_not suffer in_the least
it_was
in_fact
quite_tasty
not_a_huge selection
but_a come backer for_sure
the_staff_was_very helpful to ensure that i_knew the_vegan offerings
and brought_me began naan_bread as_well
back in_vegas again for_another short business trip and_my coworker and i_wanted_to_try something different
something out_of_the normal
came across this_restaurant on_yelp_and thought_this might_be_a new experience
i_have_to_say that i_loved_the atmosphere of_this_place
great scenery
wanted to_try_some spices from_the east
we_ordered_the chicken_tiki_masala which_i certainly loved along_with cheese nans
wow perfect meal_for what i_was_looking_for
i_only tried_indian_food once before_but it_didn't catch my eye like it_did this_time
might make_it a weekly dish if_i can_find one as_good back_home
my coworker had_lamb which_i didn't enjoy as_much
but_overall great_experience
new fan favorite
we_have_been in_las_vegas_for about a_year and_we_are slowly adding to_our list_of favorite ethnic restaurants
this_place_is tops
the_owner greeted us_and instantly made a_friend in_my yr old by giving her a_high five
gotta love a_place_that embraces kids
the_service_was fantastic and_the_food_was even better_than fantastic
we can't_wait_to go_back
we devoured the_chicken_tiki_masala and lamb_curry
and_let me not forget the orders_of garlic_naan
we_left stuffed
yet wanting more
until next_time
the best_indian_food_in_vegas without_a doubt
the_service_is superb
love the_naan_and chicken_makhani
i've_been_here for_dinner about three_times
the_food takes a_while_to come_out because_it's made_fresh from scratch
i'm not_indian but i_have_eaten food_in many_places
bay_area
montreal
calgary
vancouver
london
so cal
australia
and_this_place ranks up_there with the_best
lunch_buffet may_not be_so impressive because the_menu_is
predictable
for_those that aren't adventurous
don't evern think about going_to bollywood over this_place
ever
that place_is bad
i_guess i_should_have reviewed it the_first_time_i went about months back as that_was_a star performance
still was_a_good buffet_but i_left thinking
eh
stars
maybe_i just wasn't hungry enough today
the_tandoori_chicken_was just a_slight bit_dry and we_had_to_wait a_bit for_the_naan to_come_out
overall a_lot_of pros
every_dish had_a unique curry flavor
wasn't the_same curry taste in multiple dishes
food_was hot_and_fresh
food_quality was_good
you'd think_you ordered a_la_carte
service_was_excellent
water_was always refilled promptly
the_guy that gave one_star and_said they_used tap water
not the_case today
love_that paneer spinach_and cheese thing
chili_chicken was_good
we_were_there early enough so_that when_the cooks brought out_the trays
they too took some plates_of food from_the tray into_the back_for themselves
for_me that means no monkey business in_the_kitchen
you always assume there's not but_i've seen too_many episodes of kitchen nightmares
the_goat was so_so
kinda fatty and_lots_of bones
was_hard to_find_a good piece in the_whole tray
for
perhaps that's_not enough_to cover a_lamb substitute and maintain profit
i_think what was_missing today were my sweet monkey balls that seem_to hit the_desert spot and_some beef korma
my_favorite_dish
i_think_they had_it last time
despite this not_being as_good as_i first remembered
it's still the_best_indian_buffet i've tried
been_to about
overall a_good spread and i_will_be_back
call it
stars
really_nice selection_for a_veggie lover like_me
loved_their buffet
went_back again
and_will do_so again next_time
great_food
great_service
crappy neighborhood
but_that's vegas
my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in vegas
their_food_is very_authentic
always_fresh
as it_is_a popular lunch spot
each_time_i go they_offer a_couple_different items but_still keep some familiar favorites
so it's_hard_to get tired of going_to mount_everest
their staff_is quick to_clear your_table during_the_lunch_buffet
but_if you're planning to_go between and
be_prepared_to wait a_little_bit because_they get busy
their tamarind_sauce is_the_best
definitely my_favorite_indian_place in_town
my_wife_and_i eat_here regularly
and it_never fails to_be amazing
the_owner_is super_nice too
he remembers us_and the_fact_that my_wife loooooves super_spicy food
i'm more_of_a mild food kinda guy
and_they do_that really_well too
not_that the_lunch_buffet_is mild
it's_really good_if that's what_you_want
but stick_with dinner if_you_want super_spicy
also
if_you_ask nicely
they_have_an amazing jalape o hot paste that_you_can add_to your_food
i_don't always eat_indian
but_when_i do_i prefer mt
everest las_vegas
after_eating at_mt
everest
it's_all downhill
ha ha get_it
that's right my_friend
you will_never have_it as_good
so_far i_have_only been here_for_the_lunch_buffet
here at_least_once_a_week
sometimes twice
my_only previous experience eating_indian was_when i_lived_in nyc for_years
there_is probably million indian_restaurants there
one for every cab driver
let me_tell you my_friend
even the_best one there could_not compete with mt
everest
i_remember the_last place i_used_to eat_at
called chola
supposedly it_was_great
always packed_with indians
their_food was_always greasy_and made me_feel tired afterwards
probably from chemical
or cheap quality
mt
everest_is not_like any_other_indian_restaurant you_have eaten_in
the_food_is_not greasy
the_quality_of_the ingredients is_fresh
and_of high_quality
i_don't_know how_they do_it
every_dish at_that buffet_is_a solid ten
i_wish_they would raise their_buffet price to_keep all_the riff raff like_you yelpers out
sadly
this_place gets jam packed at_lunch
the_best_part is_that a corona is_only
i_really appreciate it_when restaurants don't try_to rape customers on liquor prices
actually the_food_is the_best_part
wait the_best_part is_the great_indian music_videos on tv there
wow
those guys know_how_to deliver a show
love_this_place
i've_been_here for_dinner as_well_as_the lunch_buffet_and haven't yet tried something i_didn't love
mount_everest is_still my
go_to
indian spot
despite having tried several others since my_first_visit
if_they delivered
you bet your ass they'd be on_their way to_my_house right_now with_a_big bag of awesome
yes
everything you've heard_about the
rough
location is_true
but_the_food makes_up_for_it
it's not_a_huge place either
so prepare for claustrophobia during_the busy times
we love_this_place
travel from henderson to_eat_here
staff_is_friendly_and attentive
food_is prepared exceptionally
you_can taste_the individual flavors in all_the_dishes
awesome food_and_service
this_place_is absolutely_amazing
before_i get to_the_food i_want_to say how nice the_waiter_was
i_think he_was the owner'a son and_he_was so_nice_and funny
he_just came_over_and talked to_us and_wanted to_see_how our_food_was and if_we_were doing okay
and_now the_food
we ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
chicken jal frezi
and dal tarka with_basmati_rice for the_main_course
all were_very_tasty and_the_chicken_was so_tender
for_dessert we_got_the sweet balls and the_rice_pudding
omg both_were soo good
oh and_of_course the_garlic_naan_was amazing
i definitely_recommend_this_place
a_little underwhelmed by_the much hyped chicken_tikka_masala
ordered_take_out
added on the_garlic_naan_and galub jamon
specified a spice_level_of for_my 'tikka and_order was_out in_minutes flat
with_a_large side of_basmati_rice
chicken_tikka_masala was_a_good size for_the_price tag
which_included the_rice
garlic_naan_was worth_the upcharge
delicious
soft
and_flavorful
with_a garlic scent that wafted through my car as_i drove home
my disappointment came when_i finally tried my_entree
for_a spice_level_of
i tasted absolutely no_spice
and_the_sauce had_a sweetness to_it that_i_am not_familiar_with
it_wasn't necessarily bad
but the_dish didn't_have_the kick_to it i_was_craving
chicken_in dish_was in large chunks
sauce was_a smidge on_the thin side
based on other_reviews
i'm_going_to have to_come_back for_the_lunch_buffet_and reevaluate
some_of_the_best_indian_food i've_had_in_a while
being new_to town
we stumbled upon this_place driving around
not_much to_look_at from the_outside but the_food_was_very_good
we_arrived_at lunch_time so decided the_best course_of action was_the buffet_so we_got_to sample a_large variety
of note
the_dishes used good_quality cuts of_meat
no nasty gristle surprised when_you chomp down
service_is_good
and the_flavors in_the_dishes are_great
the only_negative thing i_can come up_with is_that_the naan_bread is_a_little
bready
for_my_liking
i'll definitely be_back and_would recommend_it_to new_and old indian_food eaters
i'm beginning to_feel like_all indian_lunch_buffets are the_same
while good
and_flavorful
this_place_was no different
just_about all_the_indian joints i've_been_to have the_same shit
chicken_tandoori
saag
lentils
chicken_curry
whatever
i_think i'm becoming disenchanted with indian_buffets the older i_get
great
food
ambiance
personnel
service
just read nelson q
's review
nuff said
i'm coming back whenever i'm_in_vegas
best_place on earth
my_brother had_to point_out that_it_was_a rather crappy part_of_town
but_i_didn't notice anything
granted there were_a_lot_of bail bond signs around_and title loan locations
but_that does not mean it_is_a bad part_of_town
walking_into the_place
i_was hit in_the face with_the smells of_india
but_not like_it hit me in_the face with_a metal bat
more_like_a large fluffy pillow
we_were_seated and given our menus
as some_of_the others on_here have_said the_mixed platter is_excellent
the_waiter is_also_very hydrating
i_thought_i was in_delhi while_eating
without_the monkeys
or_the billion people around
it_has_been almost hours and_i_am still stuffed
this_place_has made_me rethink about the_indian_food i_get in_san diego
i_probably will_never be the_same again
the_one chick that works there
that we_saw
like_a on_the hotness scale too
one_of_the best non_vegetarian and_vegetarian indian_restaurant_i been_to
take_it from someone from who lived_in indian for_years
your buffet was_amazing
best_indian_buffet_in vegas
restaurant_is very_clean_and staff_is always very_friendly_and_attentive
good_selection_of items_on buffet and_they_are always hot_and_fresh
awesome indian_lunch_buffet
not_only_is the_price great
the_food_is too
of_all_the_indian places_in_vegas
this_is_a frequent stop for_me
i_am pretty stuffed_and satisfied everytime after dining here
the_restaurant seems_like a family_owned business_and the_customer_service is_wonderful
they_are super_nice
friendly
and seem easy_to_get their attention if you_need anything
there's_also a tv playing in the_corner with current indian movies with_plenty_of bollywood dancing and hip current indian_music
the_usual dishes we_order are
appetizers
vegetable_pakora and_samosas
thinly spiced cracker
don't know the_name_of it sorry
main_dishes
tandoori_chicken
palak_paneer
chicken_korma
chicken_makhani
lamb_curry
rogan_josh
sides
garlic_naan_and rice
the_appetizers are very_tasty_and a_good size that come_with a_mint jutney sauce and_a spicier sauce
all the_main_dishes are_very_good also
warning though
if_you_ask for_spicy
these_dishes can definately make_you sweat like_a banshsee
just ask my_bf
i_like them milder and ask_for mild or a_level
and_they_are delish
maybe
or higher will_be too_spicy and possibly not enjoyable
but up_to one's palate
the_tandoori_chicken comes out_on_a sizzling plate and_the_chicken is so_tender and_tasty
always_a safe bet
the_chicken_makhani
butter_chicken
is_my absolute favorite
the_korma and_curry are_pretty rich in spices_and have very distinct flavors to_the dishes
i_think_the palak_paneer is alright but reminds me more_of creamed spinach so_maybe a pass
this_place is_small_and cozy but usually hopping with customers
the_food may come_out a_bit slower when they_are busy but_it's worth_the_wait
always happy_with_the food_and_service here_that makes_me keep coming_back_for my_indian_food fix
i_really need_to come_for_the lunch_buffet_which looks_like_a great_deal for_the_same food
had_their buffet_and_it_was great
i_love_indian_food
but can't handle the_spiciness_of it
and didn't_think the_buffet_was too_spicy
so
if_you_love hot spicy then you_may want_to order off_of_the main menu
i'll definitely_be trying this_place_out again soon
went_here based on reviews
probably drove by times_but never checked out
it_is_a great_restaurant
good_service great_food good pricing good_selection
definitely will_be_back
after talking about_indian_food with doriee d and andrew c we_decided_to check_this_place out the_next_day for_their_lunch_buffet which runs from am to pm daily
i_usually like_to order_off_the_menu at places_like this but for_some_reason it_seems like_indian places_in_vegas prefer to_do buffet_only for_lunch
after seeing a_bunch_of positive friends' reviews of_this_place we figured it_was_a fairly safe and solid choice
given the_time_we arrived
i'd say the_buffet_was still fairly full since the_lunch_buffet ends at pm
however
we_never saw it refilled while_we_were there
on my_first plate i_tried a_little_bit_of_everything which meant i_had_a pretty full plate to_work through
the stand outs were_the curry_chicken
tandoori_chicken
and chili_chicken
which had_a_little kick_to it
the veggie_samosa and_sweet basmati_rice were_ok
and_are probably an acquired taste
fresh_naan was_brought to_our_table and_it_was warm_and delicious
not burnt
old
or cold like_some other_places
after the_first plate i_was already pretty full_and just_got seconds of_the chicken_dishes i_liked
we_wanted_to_try their milky balls p for_dessert but they_were_all gone by_the_time_we were_done eating so we_had_to settle for the_sweet_rice pudding instead
which i_believe is called kheer
for
for_an ayce buffet_the food_was_decent and_i would_come_back the_next_time_i have_a craving_for_indian_food
the food_was_okay
i_had malai_kofta_and it_was_too sweet_and kofta_was hard
the_waiter asked_how was the_food_and i_told_him exactly how it_was
next_time_i may try_different dish
the_place_was busy
assuming the_food must_be good_but that's_not the_case
i_guess_it depends what_you order
best_indian_restaurant
great_buffet during_lunch hours
can't_be beat for the_cost
and_quality
sauces made slow over hours at a_lunch_buffet
sign me_up
i_have_to come here_at_least once or twice a_month
hand down man down
worth_it
very_good_food
nice crew
recommend_this_place_to everyone who likes indian_cuisine
this_place_was amazing
my_boyfriend_and_i took his mom there for_a_late mother's day dinner
he_had recently gone to_india so she thought trying_indian good sounded good
we showed up and_got seated_right away
very_small
quiet place
all the_employees were_very_nice and_our_server was_very_helpful with suggestions
there_were of_us so_we just_got a_bunch_of different_things to_share
this_dish i_chose was_the lamb_masala
amazing
very_sweet spicy_sauce and_that lamb_was cooked_perfectly
by the_end_of_the_meal everyone_was so full_and the_bill was very_reasonable
overall great_experience_and will_definitely be_back_to_try the_lunch_buffet
brilliant buffet super spongy naan
crunchy pakoda and samosa were my_favorites
if u r dying for_some good_indian_food
this_place_will definitely satisfy you
if_you're_in the_mood_for some authentic_indian_food spice this_is_a place_to_go
the_food_is absolutely fantastic down_to the_naan_bread spices_are true to scale flavors_are on_point
the_location doesn't look_like much when_you first pull up
in_fact might find yourself questioning your_choice
but trust_me you_will_get over_it as_soon as_you try the_food
also
this_is_a very family oriented restaurant
so bring the_kids and whoever else in_your family tree
b
the_staff behaved very_bad
if_you_ask them_for
liquor menu
their reply is_an arrogant
no
because_you asked_for_a wrong menu
it's called the
beer menu
not liquor
lol
food_is average
not something exciting
all_my rating is_for_the samosa_and the_indian bread
which_was always served hot
very_good service
even when_it_was crowded
overall a_decent star
really_good food
i'm an_indian and knows what_is a_good_indian good
friendly_and quick_service
we_ordered spicy_food
and_loved_it
their dessert was_average
therefore giving
stars else would have_given
awesome_food
great_taste
but takes a_while for_them to_get you seated
well the_fact_that i drive half way across town
at rush hour
in heat
should tell you_what you_need_to know
the_food_and_service are very_very_good
i_have_tried several indian_restaurants_in_town and mount_everest is_by_far my_favorite
the_food_is_great the prices_are_reasonable
and_the_service_is fast
for_dinner the chicken_tikki_masala is_amazing
and_if you're looking_for_a_good fast lunch their_lunch_buffet can't_be beat
the_chicken_tiki_masala is_delicious_and the_servers_were so_nice
when_we first pulled up we_were_not so sure because it_looks small_and old_and in_an older area but_once_you got inside it_was_ok and smelled so_good
ask_for garlic_naan
best indian_cuisine lunch_buffet in_town
after wanting to_try_this_place on my_last couple visits to_vegas
i_finally made_it there_on monday
the husband_and_i literally drove from phoenix straight to mount_everest for_the_lunch_buffet
this_buffet was_no joke
the_food_on it_was_very_good
we_both felt it was_one_of_the_best indian_buffets we_had_been to
so_much so
that i_ate a_ton_of_food and_couldn't eat another thing for_the_rest_of the_day
standout dishes_were the chickpea_curry
the_sweet_rice
never seen this before
and_the warm carrot dessert
so_tasty
the_chicken_tikka_masala wasn't the_best i'd ever_had
complaints include
we_finished a_full plate_of food_before getting the_opportunity to_ask_for naan
they_didn't bring any to_us
our booth was_in a_weird corner you had_to squeeze into
and_their women's bathroom wasn't super clean
although_i imagine that_was from a_recent customer and_not due_to_a general lack_of cleanliness
i_would_recommend_this_place to locals for_sure
this_is typical family_run indian_place
just off_the_strip
very enthusiastic guys and service_is_great
food_is also nice
decor could have_been_better but the_guys friendly disposition makes for_it
the_food_is_fresh_and portion_size is_great
since my_favorite indian_joint was shut down due_to health code violations
come_on
what are a_few cockroaches when the_food_is_amazing
i_decided_to give_this_place_a shot
i_really_liked it
my_date and_i split the_mt
everest dinner which_had a_little_bit_of_everything and_it_was delish
it_was_also more_than enough food_for_the two_of_us
we_also added an_order_of garlic_naan_and it_was_so tasty
my_only complaints are
the paleek paneer only had_one small chunk of_paneer
and the_service_was_pretty impersonal
the_prices_were pretty average
and the_location_is not_the_best but_i do_love a_good hole in_the_wall from time_to time
will_i go_here again
yep
i'd_love to
will_i keep hunting for_the a_new go_to for_indian_food
yeah
this_place_was great_but isn't quite as_good as_some other_places i've_been_to
for_a_lunch_buffet
it's_good quality_and choices
they_have_some exotic choices such_as goat
along_with_the classic indian_dishes such_as curry
saag
the_best dish
and_paneer
it_comes_with an_order_of naan_bread
all_of this for_just above is an_awesome deal
i_ordered_the mango_lassi and_it_was too_sweet
that's probably the_only real compliant
service_is quick_and friendly_and easy_to find
parking_is abundant
i relied on yelp_reviews and_made a_trip to_this_place all_the_way from las_vegas strip
it's_not that far
it_took_me just mins by cab
i_came_in for_lunch_buffet and i_didn't_like what_i saw so_i asked_if_i can_order ala_carte but sadly that don't allow that
i arrive bit early and_the_food labels on_the_buffet were wrong
samosa was_good_and so was_the_naan but rest_of_the stuff was_disappointing
i_would_not recommend_this_place_to anyone
one_of_the_best_indian buffet yet
excellent_food selection_and display
samosas and_chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori_chicken
sweet_rice
lentil
chutney
naan_are stars
and_try chai_tea too
for
this_is_an amazing spread
restaurants clean
definitely made_it onto my_fav lunch spot list
visiting from nj where there_is_a large indian population
i_can_say this_was a_great_find in_lv
the_flavors here_are not_quite as bold and cater towards more of_an american crowd
but everything_was_delicious
we_shared_the mt_everest combination meal which_was a_great_deal and had_a_good amount_of_food
would_recommend to_anyone_looking_for their curry fix
very_tasty
reasonably_priced indian_food
especially considering the_cost at some_of_the_other restaurants_and resorts in_vegas
we_made the_drive from henderson and it_was_worth_it chicken_tikka_masala_and lamb_korma were_both tasty
but_had kick
i_had_to order a_mango_lassi to quench the fire
attentive_staff and_easy parking just_be aware it_might feel a_little sketchy in_that area
but we_had_no problems
get the_garlic_naan
too
i_am surprised mt_everest has_a higher rating than mint because_it_is not_even close_to_the same quality
when_i pulled up i_was_surprised to_see_a drive thru but then_i realized it_was closed and the_employees were using it_to park their cars
upon walking_into the_restaurant
i_noticed the_buffet in_the_back corner looking sad and unsanitary
i sat down_and shortly after_we were_brought out_the papadum and_were asked what_we_wanted to_order
the papadum and_sauces just weren't good_and to_top things off_the basket it_was_in was_not cleaned
i shouldn't have overlooked this but_i_did because_i was_craving_indian_food
i_ordered two mango lassi's
garlic_naan
malai_kofta
chicken_makhani their speciality
and_basmati_rice
the_mango lassi's were_brought out instantly
this_one_was not made well
was overly sweet
tasted artificial
and_was_not thick enough
i_was_able_to stomach mine but my_dining partner wanted_to send hers back
i_asked_the asian man if we_could send it_back and_he giggled and said_no
then our indian waiter comes over laughs and says mango lassi's our supposed_to be sweet_and i_said i_know i_have_had my a_mango_lassi before_but but_this overly sweet
he begrudgingly took it_back
our_entrees come and_the_portions_are huge
both of_the_curries had_that artificial taste_and reminded me_of curry_at a_food_court
the_chicken in the_chicken_makhani was_dry and_the fat was_not trimmed off properly
the_veggie balls in the_malai_kofta were_extremely hard on_the_outside and_not very moist on_the_inside
the_garlic_naan_was tasty_but once_again it_was brought out_in a_basket that was_not clean
the_indian_food here_is mediocre and_i question how well things are cleaned
we really_enjoyed_the_food
great_flavor throughout_the_meal
the_chicken dishes_were moist fork cut
and_the_lamb we_had_was well prepared
this_is_a little_gem of_an_indian joint
best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
their butter_chicken_is soooooo delicious
to_die_for
the_owner_is so_friendly and_very professional
i_always recommended people to_go_there when they_are craving_indian_food even when_i help my guests visiting me_at the spa where_i work
one_of_the best restaurants_in_vegas
great_service
the food_was_served within a_few_minutes of ordering
taste_was really_good_and the_quantity was_good_too
would_definitely go_back again
we eat_indian_food a_lot and are_quite particular
i_am pleased to_say_that this_restaurant exceeded my_expectations in_all respects
i_like_that the_owner_and his family work together and are_very service oriented
of_course the_food_is why we_would go_and
again
it exceeded our expectations
clearly
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was excellent as_was_the lamb_vindaloo
big menu making_it hard_to choose and_i_found myself looking_at all_the_great dishes coming out_if the_kitchen
try_and get_there early to_get_a booth as it_looks much_more comfortable than a_regular table
highly_recommended and we_will_be_back soon with_our friends
yes
yes
yes
my_wife_and_i took a_little bus ride over here_on one_of_our annual trips_to vegas
honeymoon this_time yay
and man was_it worth_it
we_love indian_buffets
but in_the midwest the_quality level can vary quite_a_bit
mount_everest hits it out_of_the park
price was_incredibly reasonable
they_had just_about every indian_food_i've_ever_had available
and the_taste_was sublime
mouth_watering delicious
the_staff_was polite_and friendly_too
the bus ride was very_reasonable
we bought_a deuce bus hr pass
which_was_also good_for the_city bus
so we_were_able_to hop one from_the_strip over_to there
its_a pretty quick ride and the_neighborhood seemed fine
i've snagged the duece pass each time_i've been in_vegas_and despite being slow at_times its one_of_the best ways to_save money when out_on_the town
if_you_are an_indian_buffet lover
this_is_my_favorite of_all_the ones i've_had
so definitely make_the time_and give_it_a stop
hands_down_the_best_indian food we've_had and that_is saying something
excellent vegetarian_options and they_made two perfectly executed custom vegan_dishes for my_husband
customer_service_was beyond expectations
nice relaxed atmosphere
and located off_the_strip so_great prices_for lots_of amazing_food
we_will_definitely_be making a_trip back
had_dinner_here on_a_friday_night
food_was_very_good and service_was_friendly if a_little scattered
they just_opened this week so_i_am sure the_service will_get better
recommend checking them_out
saag_paneer was_great_and_the naan_was_also good
being_indian and_having eaten_at many of_the_best_indian_restaurants in_the_valley
i'm_not your usual casual diner who knows nothing about_indian_food
i_usually eat dosa and_south_indian fare at woodlands
ray and rural
i_tried cafe_krishna for a_change
i_was_disappointed
the_service_was lousy
the_waitstaff was_not rude_and in_fact they_were_very friendly_but the_wait was too_long
we_ordered an_appetizer and_two dosas
they_took a minutes_to bring_us our_appetizer and another_minutes
hour
before we_got_our dosa
it_was_not busy when_we_ordered
there were_only couples in_the_restaurant at_the_time and_they_had waiters
they_never checked_on us and_we_had to_flag them down to_get_our bill
one_of_the waiters is_an eastern european woman who spoke no english and had_never waited tables before
she_brought our chaat to_our_table and didn't_even bring plates with_it
the_food_itself was_good_but not noteworthy
their chutneys_were not tasty or flavorful
the coconut_chutney at woodlands is_a_lot better
the_dosa had very_little sabji
potato
filling and_was nearly entirely just_one large crepe
the_dosa at woodlands includes much_more sabji
i_did like_the sabji and thought_it_was better_than woodlands because_it_was slightly less greasy
the samosa_chaat was_not_good
it_had very_little samosa
maybe two small pieces_of one samosa
and_the_rest of_it included vegetables
it_wasn't_bad but neither was_it tasty
the_only positive aspect to the_place_was it's ambience
despite its
cafe
name
the_place_is a sit down restaurant
it's nicer than many full fledged indian restaurants_in_the_valley
it_was clean
spacious with_many booths
and decorated well
you_are seated
given_a menu_and a_waiter takes your_order
it's not_like woodlands in which_you order_at the_register
it_has_a full menu_but it's vegetarian
it's_also a_south_indian place_so i_wouldn't recommend ordering saag_paneer and north_indian dishes because south indians don't know_how_to cook north_indian food
i_will_not come_back because the_service_was too slow
even_when we flagged our_waiter for_our bill
there_was another couple who_had sat for_minutes and_had not_even had_their drink_orders taken
honestly
why would i wait an_hour to_eat dosa when_i can go up the_street and eat_at woodlands and_get the_same quality dosa in_minutes
i'm_pretty forgiving of slow_service if the_restaurant_is super busy or_if there_is only_one server but_this_was different
you_could tell the_waiters had_no previous experience waiting tables_and had_no sense_of urgency
they_didn't know_how_to refill drinks
check up_on you
bring_your bill to_you on time
it_seemed_like they_were related to the_owner or were part owners and_tried to_be servers
if the_restaurant improved their speed and_service
i_would_recommend_this_place
hopefully that_will improve
scale_of
multiple visits
food
service
atmosphere
value
the_service_is_very friendly
the_food_is_very_good an_excellent coconut_chutney and_their combo meals are_well priced_and offer up a_good_variety
scale_of
food good authentic vegetarian fare plus some unusual breads
service very_friendly but rather slow
atmosphere clean
but_i always prefer indian_restaurants a_little dimmer
value
they_are still a_little new_and hopefully trying_to improve the speed of the_service
the_quality_of_the_food makes for somewhat haphazard service
if_you_go in expecting somewhat slightly slow_service and_are not_in_a rush you will_certainly enjoy this_restaurant
update have_been_going to_this_restaurant regularly for_at least the_last months
overall have become even_more impressed_by the_variety and_selection of_dishes
also service_has improved with time
i_think i_have_to place this at the_top_of my_favorite restaurants
even above_the delhi palace which has_been our_favorite for the_last years
highly_recommended
this_review pertains to_the_lunch_buffet only
i_would_expect a_different experience_at dinner
first_off
the_service_was_very
self serve
which_is_what one_would expect_from a_buffet
but there_are_no self serve stations for_water or tea refills
and the_wait_staff seldom made an appearance
the_food_was_good
but_i_am not_a_fan_of most buffets
my_friend informed me_that the_food_was much better at_dinner
and_i intend on finding out sometime
i_enjoy good_indian_food every once in awhile and cafe_krishna was a_great_place_to indulge
i_like_that its all_vegetarian and_the choices are abundant
the_food_was_great
i_just_wish the service_was_a_little better
it_was_a_little bit_slow and inconsistent
i definitely_recommend trying one_of_their dosai and a_curry both are_delicious
i_had_never had dosai until this_place opened
every version i've tried is yummy
the accompanying sauces
however
can_be_a_little too heavy and spicy_for_me
it sounds to_me that their_lunch_buffet_is the_problem but other wise cafe_krishna is_a_great_place for_vegetarian fare from_india
their_food_is mainly south_indian such_as dosas
chutneys etc
we_have_eaten dessert here at_night time_and our impression was_great
not_only of the_gulab jamuns
rass malai and_the_mango kulfi that we_ate but_also of the_service_and their overall setup
this_is_a clean south_indian eatery unlike the udupi place in_tempe
go_here
you_will like
the facility was_a clean environment for_food and_there_was a_good_variety on_the_menu
i_was_there for_the dinner meal
i_was thoroughly unhappy with_the_service that_was received here during_dinner on_a_saturday_night
first the_servers_were not able to figure out how_to set_up a_table that_was correct for the_size_of the party that_was attending
next the server_was_very unorganized giving us items_that we_did_not order_and forgetting items_that were ordered
when brought_to his attention the_server went back_to_the kitchen without offering an apology
he_then proceded to_bring the_same dish as he_had brought out before that_was an incorrect item and_did_not bring_out items_that were ordered
at_this_point this_was pointed out to_him again he went_back in only to_come_out minutes later after most_of_the party had finished_eating with_the items_that he_had forgotten to bring_out
the_waiter made excuses for_what happened and_did_not apologize nor offer any compensatory changes to the_bill due_to his mistakes
after the_desert was ordered this too was below expectations
the_waiter seemed disinterested in how we_felt about_the_food and_our overall satisfaction at_dinner
waiter_was disinterested
disorganized
and unapologetic
overall avoid this_restaurant
this_is new hotness out_of phoenix
they_offer flavorful food_on lunch_buffets
and it_seems_to be
i
pulling a_lot_of_people out_of their houses to_come and enjoy_the_food
ii
taking away buisness from other_indian joints
weekend
friday lunch_buffet through sunday dinner
food_quality has_been great_and consistent
most items have_their unique flavors_and textures
weekday dinners quality_is not consistent
service is_generally sloppy
they_have not figured out_the co ordinate system of_the_place they own
what_is table x and where is_that
how_many of_people y are sitting_on that table x and_what each_of_the person ordered_and in what order
i believed they found themselves unprepared to_the high clientele they attracted based_on_the quality_of_the_food
quality_of_food however easily over rides this sightly negative aspect which_is already improving
and_the sloppiness offers something additional for_us_to chuckle about at_the_table
the_other thing_i rate food joints on is whether the_food feels too filling in_one or_two round
its better_than most other_places in_the_valley
north_indian appetizers are not_great
have_not sampled dessert menu enough to_write about_it
its all_vegetarian
suits me i_am_a vegetarian
two words inconsistent indifferent
awesome indian_food
nice buffet
mint rice_is unique
dosa
that_was_the main reason we_came to_this_place
i_had_a combo
that gave_me the_chance_to try dosa_and more other_things
good_service
nice_place and_friendly attention
now a five_star
i_had to_go_back_and update my review_for cafe krisha
as_i_have made several more visits since_my original posting
cafe krisha has_been open for_a_while and_has still failed to supply guests with_a menu_that marks what items_are suitable for vegans
at vegetarian restaurants
a menu_that marks what_is vegan is_not just_a convenience
it_is_a standard
cafe_krishna stands virtually alone in_the_phoenix as the_only vegetarian restaurant_that fails to_offer this
this wouldn't_be an_issue if servers_were more willing to ensure that products were dairy free
getting_a confirmation that_a menu_items are dairy free from the_servers feels_like pulling teeth
and_i making people's lives more difficult makes me_feel uncomfortable
i_just want_to sit down and_eat with_no worries
a_simple
v
next to_all_the vegan items would_make me_feel more inclined to_eat_at cafe_krishna
it would_make me_feel more certain about what_i_was eating
and_it would_make the lives for the_servers easier not_having to_run back_and forth the_kitchen every_time_i
and every_other vegan
have_a question about dairy in_my food
that aside
the_food_at krishna can_be quite_good
i've_had crispy
spicy gobi_manchurian here_and i've_had mild
crumbly gobi_manchurian
the rasam and sambar is_always_good
and the_dosas are_usually a_pretty safe bet
i_had my_first_experience with uttapam here
and_it_was quite_good but_i'll be_sure to_ask_for no raita next_time
so
cafe_krishna
mark the_vegan items
and work on a_little consistency and_you could_easily outscore any_other_indian join in_town
om nom nom
they_had me_at
authentic_indian veg
but it's_really quite exceptional
we_both_had the_lunch_buffet
which_has quite few main_dishes and_desserts
it_is comparable to_lunch buffets_i've really_enjoyed in_the_bay_area or manhattan
both in_terms of_quality and_variety
and very_reasonably_priced at
the_buffet includes a_dosa and_i_think also a_drink
i_had_the tofu manchurian
a_nice chana dish i_haven't_had before
not chana_masala
plain_rice
there_are several other choices for_rice
an okra dish
some_nice fresh salad
and_some ieee naf on_the side
the_masala tea came unsweetened
which_is how_i prefer it
the_kheer was quite_tasty
and that's_just scratching the surface
if_i_lived in chandler i'd want_to_eat here every_day
heck
if_i still lived_in tucson i'd_be tempted to_go_there for_lunch once in_a_while as_it_is
i'll definitely be_back next_time i'm passing through at_lunch time
by the_way
some reviews have_said things about_the_food being cold
i_didn't_have that experience it_was_all the_right temperature for_me
andrea and_i arrived before noon
so kind of on_the early side
i_found_the service to_be prompt_and friendly
i_have_been_here twice for the_past couple_of_weeks and_i_must_say the_food_and_service is vastly improved
buffet was_excellent_and service_was respectful
am thinking twice in_a row cannot be_a fluke
keep_it up krishna cafe
thank goodness for living_social
or i_might never_have discovered_this_place
as_a_vegetarian
this_was_my hog heaven
minus the hog
i_mean
i_could literally order anything i_wanted and would_be sure_that there_wasn't an accidental chicken stock action
or that pork might show up towards the_bottom of_the bowl
i_also really_really loved that they_offer both northern and southern options dosas and curries
i_went_on a_saturday_night with my_partner and a_friend
for
we_got starters
a_dosa combo plate
a_thali
iced_tea and a_mango_lassi
and we_took home dosas
naan
and_a_few other_things
great pricing and_lots_of food for_your buck
most_of_the_food was_absolutely_amazing
although_i found it_to_be heavy on_the onions
not_a_huge_fan
and_some_of it_to_be too_spicy
as_far as_the negative
the_service_was awful
when someone came_by
they_were super_friendly
all times through out the_meal
it took_us two hours to_order
eat_and pay
waiting_for the_check took almost minutes on_its own
my partner's iced_tea was_empty for_the majority of_the_meal
also
not an_issue for_us
but the_vegan items weren't marked
which would_have_been a_problem if any one_was vegan
the_food_and pricing gets stars
the_service gets
overall
a
and i'll_have to_go_back for_the_buffet at_some_point
when_i get_to provide my_own service
i_really_enjoyed this_place
was_pleasantly_surprised the_quality_of_food
more_than anything
i_was amazed how full i_was_on a vegetarian_menu
highly_recommended for new experiences
as_good_as_it gets for south_indian_food here
indian authentic would of_course be much better
food_is_awesome
fresh_ingredients
cool variety_of chutneys love_their combos
on menu
that_way you_can taste a_bit_of everything
also dig their mini idly
rice flour balls
medu vada
paysam for_dessert and ofcourse the rava masala or_just the_masala_dosa
delish
the_service can_be_a_bit slow_and mainly because it_gets busy towards peak hours and doesn't_have way_too many servers but for_me its' worth_the_wait
at_this_place
check_it_out
i_can hardly tell my paneer's from_my gobi's but_i_can tell you that_i like_this_place
walk_in and_you_will find a_modern contempray dinning room with granite top tables
booths and tables
in back is the_buffet setup
we_were_in for_lunch at
on_a_saturday and_the_buffet was_the_only option
and_what a_good option it_was
so_many flavorful dishes and_all veg
i_tried them_all then tried_many a_second and third time
we were_offered dosas
a_indian crepe like item
i_don't_know_if this cost us extra but_it_was good_and with dosa's the_buffet_was
the_dishes had pretty_good flavor
some flavors did_not pop as_much as i_would_have_liked but_overall the_selection and_quality won me over
the_buffet_is nice as i_am still mostly lost on what_to_order when looking_at an_indian_food menu
we_had water_with our_meal
they_give_you glasses and_a carafe of_water but oddly no ice
if_you_are veg go_here and_just keep eating
if_you_are_not
you_may not_even notice that the_place_is meat free
i've_always had_some difficulty finding good indian_food_in_the_valley
cafe_krishna was_a refreshing change_from_the sub par establishments that_i_have become accustomed_to
the_food was_quite_good and more_than compensated for_the slightly innocuous atmosphere
the
combos
offer a_lot_of_food at_a_very affordable price_and may prove to_be perfect_for someone trying_indian faire for_the_first_time
vegetarian
or_not
i_feel confident that you_will enjoy cafe_krishna
the combos were_very_good and at_a good_price
i_liked the_food_at woodlands a_bit better but the_atmosphere here_was a_little_less take_out then there
will_be_going back
i visit_this_place very often for_the_lunch_buffet
there_is_a wide_variety_of veg_and vegan_dishes in_both north and south_indian_cuisine
to_start_with there_is salad
veg fritters and chaat
north_indian snack
the_main_course has naan
bread
different gravies
a_rice dish
gravies to_eat with plain_rice and a_curry
you_get a_choice_of dosa
crepe
between plain_and stuffed which are_both equally good
there_is_also a desert and_a fruit to_finish the_meal
sometimes the_service_is_very slow and_the waitresses do_not clear the_plates and_take time to_bring the_check
but_overall very_yummy and satisfying food
not_just vegetarian folks
but_even meat_eaters like_this_place from_what_i have_seen
definitely a_must visit
went_here_with an_indian friend so_i_can't tell you_what i_ate
but_it_was tasty
we_went
pm on_a_thursday and_it_was_pretty empty
but_as the_night progressed more and more_people filled the_place out
they_do_have a lunchtime buffet_but not_sure the_price or quality_of_food
but if_it's anything like the_dinner we_had
its worth checking_out
we_have_eaten here_a_few more_times and_each_time we_have_been
we have_liked this_place more
we mostly go_for_dinner
the_masala in_the dosa_is very_bland and not_enough
the sambhar could_be a_tad more_spicy
but
overall we like_this_place
he_loved the_gobi_manchurian that they_serve there_and_the naans_were awesome
better_than any north_indian restaurant naans that we_have_eaten and mind you this_is_a south_indian restaurant
my vegetarian_and_vegan friends love_this_place
i_thought this_place_was fantastic
food_is_very fresh_and_tasty
not_greasy at_all
which_made for no indigestion afterward
that_is so rare with_indian_food
i_usually feel weird afterward from_the grease and_spice
their_lunch_buffet_is very_very_good
we_want to_come_back for_dinner_and try mutter_paneer
my fave
i_work near here and_have_never gone in
today at_lunch
a g f and_i_went there_and it_was_really_good
great south_indian_food and_a_nice clean atmosphere
at_lunch
they_have_a nice buffet_with wonderful vegetarian selections for
you_can't beat that
order
and along with_a_mango drink split it with_a_friend or_two and_you_will all be fat and_happy when_you leave
have_been here_several_times now
and hands_down_the_best_indian food_i've_ever tasted
love_it and_go back_at least twice a_month
it's awesome for pure vegetarians
it_took_a lot to convince my_husband to_go so_far to_an_indian_restaurant
when there_are one's closer_to home
but_now
even he_is a_fan
the_food tastes_like home_made
the_service_is_good and seating comfortable
no garish decor either
water is brought right away_and they_even keep a carafe of_it at your_table so_no need to_wait_for eye contact with_a waiter waitress to quench your thirst
almost_all the entree's on_the_buffet were_good
not_too spicy_but tasty
dessert was_good
they_had kheer made_with tapioca balls rather than rice
my_daughter would have_liked to_have gulab jamoon
the vadaas were soft on_the_inside and crisp on_the_outside as they_should be
now for_some comparison with udupi
which_is_the other south_indian restaurant i_have_been_to around here
sambar not_as_good_as udupi
masala dosas not_as big i_liked them but my_family likes the udupi masala dosas
they did_not_have idlis
now that_was_a surprise
but_overall
i_would_recommend_this_place
it_also looked clean
on_a dinner break from work
my lovely significant other and_i_thought this_place sounded so much_more interesting than the_other nearby options
and_there had_been some recent positive lunchroom chatter about cafe_krishna
i_really wish_we had_more time_to linger
but_that will_be the next_visit
i_ordered kadai bhindi_masala
the_okra was_so tender_and_the spices_were just_right
left_me wanting for_more
beside me_was a_delicious curry
the_naan_was ample and_fresh
this_food was_excellent_and the_variety more extensive than most_indian_restaurants i_have visited
but_i must compliment the excellent_service and attention given to a_special dietary request
the_staff went above and beyond our reasonable expectations
we_were so pleased with_their care to_get_it just_right
i_recommend cafe_krishna to_anyone_who loves spices beyond salt and pepper
and_is willing to forget that_it_is vegetarian
too
it_is well_worth a_little drive
and_i_am really happy_to find_it close_to_my job
been here_at_least a_dozen times
gobi_manchurian_is exceptional and_the_buffet usually is_too
unfortunately i_haven't_been back_in months as_we went_for_lunch and the_selection_was terrible
items
i_asked what_was up_and they_said their gas was out_all morning and_they couldn't cook
when_i_got the_check they asked_how was everything and_i told_them terrible as_we_were literally going_to_have to_leave and_go somewhere_else for_lunch_and they_said sorry about_that it won't happen again_but proceeded_to charge us full price
so disappointing we_were regulars but that_did it for_us
i_am sure it_was_a one off issue so_don't not go_there because_of my_review we miss it
but paying full price to_get_a mouthful of_there food
put a_bad taste in_our mouth figuratively of_course
the_food_is above_average
not_the_best
but certainly enjoyable
the_service_is quite hit_or_miss
more
miss
than
hit
i'm_pretty apathetic about_this_place
i_have a_friend_who lives right down_the_street and_we enjoy going_here and_being left alone to chat
but_it's_not something i'd seek out
what_is nice
if_it matters to_you
is the_atmosphere
it's_quite sterile and borning
which_makes sense considering it's in_a_strip_mall in chandler
but there_are_plenty_of good_indian places_that are_in dive environs
so_a sterile
suburban feeling place is_a_nice upgrade at_times
hi
i_am_a south_indian and_this_place_is awful
they_serve too slow_and food_is bad
price_is ok but_you_can get better_food at the_same_price
my serious suggestion is_not to_try_this_place
have a_nice day
thanks

south_indian vegetarian_food we_went_for_the buffet_only time_i've felt everything_i tried tasted_great
visit az just to_eat_here
we_had_a really_nice dinner_here
the_staff_was super_friendly
the_food_was_excellent and the_prices_were reasonable
our food_came_out quickly
and_the_restaurant was_clean
the_staff answered our questions and_were courteous
we_had_the vege curry
and_the_curry with okra
we_also_tried a_very cool looking triangular dosai
it_was_our_first time_trying dosai and_i_think it_was_the_best meal of_the_night
though the_others were_quite yummy
great_buffet
one dosa per_person is included in_the_buffet
although if_you_are_a new comer there
no_one will tell you
you have_to_ask the_wait_staff for a_dosa
the_staff_was attentive_and nice
food_was_great with options_for dessert_and freshly prepared food_was coming in from_the_kitchen every few hours
the coconut_chutney is_great
this_was_our first_time_here and_we really_enjoyed_it
there_were many_things on_the_menu_that we_had never_tried before_and we_liked that
we basically asked the_staff what_they recommended and_ordered that
i_asked_for mine
hot
and_it_was at the_most medium in spice
i_have_found that people don't usually take me seriously the_first_time_i dine somewhere and request
hot
that_was_a bummer for_sure
but the_flavors_were great
we_had_the mini idlies and_loved the_different chutneys for_dipping
we_also enjoyed the_vegetable pakoda which_was done very_well here
probably the_best_i've_had
for_an entrees
we_had_the masala_dosa which was_really_good
very_different
to_me
as i've not had it_before
i_had_the chole batura which_was excellent
the_portions_are huge_and easily made_for leftovers and_for enough_to shared
i_will_definitely come_back to_try_some different_things
the_menu_is very extensive and_prices were_really_good
vegetarian only buffet
very slow at replenishing their buffet_line even though they_only_had a_few_dishes
i_enjoy coming_here_for lunch occasionally
i_like indian_buffets
unlike chinese buffets
which_i abhor
because_of_the variety_of ingredients_and dishes i_get to_sample that_i otherwise may_not order if_it_was a_la_carte
this_place specializes in vegeterian indian_food
a_very typical thing
and_i've had_some interesting meal combinations here
lots_of legumes
leafy greens
curries
all mixed in_with vegetables_and occasionally tofu
nothing has really ever stood out with_the_food
but_it has_never been a_bad_experience
the facilities are another story
i_was_there recently when_they ran out_of tp in_the lady's bathroom
i_actually checked before using thankfully
i alerted the_girl that works the_front desk and_she was_completely useless
she said she'd refill it_and_it never was refilled
when_i_asked her again
after holding my bladder throughout my_meal
she said they_were completely out
really
how are_you out_of tp
who manages inventory for_this_place
i_can_only imagine that_if someday they_were_out_of hand soap
they'd handle it the_same way
which_means your cooks could_be making your_food with dirty hands
grody
if_you_are_a vegetarian
you_must eat_here
their indian food_is_amazing
also
i_took someone from work here_that is_really big on beef and_always having to_have meat
and they_still liked this_place
you won't even miss the_meat
seriously
also their_service is_the_best
eew
a_buffet with_no meat
o
ok
i_knew what_i_was getting into before driving miles over here_because i'm_a yelpie
yeah yelp
have you bought any of_our newly released stock yet
for
right_now you_can be yelp
i'm_just askin'
sorry i morphed into jim kramer for_a moment
back_on topic
let's get an actual gripe out_of_the way
the_sambar soup_was the_first_thing i_tried
it_was lukewarm
there goes a_star right_off_the bat
o
ok
so was_there anything good about_this_place
or is_it lower than thiruvananthapuram we call_the mover with_the glitziest elephant
ur
i_mean the_best yelp rating
send these_guys packing
pots pans banging
back_to bangalore
well maybe
but first let us consider
you get_your choice_of a_table or_a booth in_this mid sized restaurant
yeah booths
it's_a modern
nice_place with_a peaceful
comfortable air about_it due in part to_the excellent acoustics
lighting layout
and_yes
they_were_busy
the_staff_was cheerful
friendly
the table_service just_right
indian girl
whom unlike the_soup was_fairly hot
sorry
had them fix me a_dosa
the latest foofy food around the_valley
in_my choice_of flavors from a_little menu she_had with_her
mine was_tasty
with curried potatoes whatnot inside
there were_only about main food_items plus sauces dressings
but_that seemed_like enough
some of_my_favorites besides the_dosa were_the sambhar
soup
the mutter_paneer
pongal
biryani rice
the_creamy hot help yourself tea
and the_gulab janum
monkey balls
for_dessert
hare krishna
hare rama
they_were_so awesome
what a_pleasure to_eat_at this lovely place today with_its interesting
different delicious_food
his divine grace a
c
bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada would_have approved it i_think you'll like cafe_krishna too
monday through thursday lunch_buffet
been here_many_times but has always_been disappointing
of late the_quality_is becoming worse
they_are just well situated near intel
home of mini india
true they_don't serve meat
true the_lunch_buffet_is reasonably_priced_and darn_good
have_eaten here_several_times
dishes change everytime i_have_been
not_a_huge selection
but_i left full_and quite happy
noticed a_bunch_of comments on_the service
my_experience has_been that the_service_is fine
i_would_not call it stunning
but_it_is lunch_buffet after_all
my needs were fairly low water_and some bread
the_servers have always_been helpful in explaining what everything_is when_i have_asked
n joy
congratulations
cafe_krishna
you're the_first_place i've ever given_a star_rating
i'm a_vegetarian an i_was fully aware that it_only serves vegetarian_food
so_the low rating has nothing to_do_with being_a disappointed meat_eater
my_husband_and_i ate here_for_dinner
we_were_the_only people in_the_restaurant when_we_ordered and_it_took minutes_for_our food to_arrive at_the_table
somehow
my_food was luke warm
speaking of luke warm
the_water i_was given to_drink was_warm tap water with_no ice
i_can handle drinking tap water
but yeesh
throw some ice in_it
when_we_were finished_eating
we_waited_for the_check
and_waited
i_then asked_for_the check
and the_person said they'd be right back_with it
they never_came
so we_waited
and_waited
finally someone brought_us our_check
in total we_were_there_for an_hour and a_half
most_of_the time just sitting there waiting_for one_thing or another
the_food_itself was meh
nothing spectacular really
i've_eaten at plenty of_places with terrible_service when the_food_is_good enough_to balance it_out
definitely_not the_case here
i_might come_back someday and try_the_buffet
but_i'll never be_back there_for_dinner
went_here today based on yelp_reviews
was_nice_and clean roomy inside
this_is_a vegetarian place with_no meat on_the_menu
sounded right_up my alley
i_ordered curry vegetables
it_was_pretty_good but the_portions_were very_small
waiters_were not_good
took_over min for_food to_arrive with literally no_one else there
took_over min
to_get_the check after we_were_done despite asking_for the_check multiple_times
they_serve warm tap water with_no ice or lemons
overall considering how expensive it_was and_the_fact that_its only_a block away from my_favorite_indian_place
woodlands
i_will_not_be back
good south_indian_food
chass is_good to cool off
evenings are not_the_best time to_go
takes a_lot_of time to_get_the food
great_vegetarian place
i_had_the uthappam with vadai curry_and_the okra curry
it_was_delicious and especially_the vadai curry and_it_was just_the_right_amount_of spice_and tasted what_i believe to_be coconut milk
i_really don't_like okra but the_okra was edible with some_garlic_naan
i kind of laughed when_i saw chinese options on_the_menu
i_guess only north indians do this but_really should remove it_from their_menu
the_service_was okay as the_guy keeps forgetting to_bring some items
no biggie
the_place itself is_nice_and the_price_was low for an_indian_place
even at dinner_time
so_i say_this_is a_must_try
you_know it_will_be good when_you see indian ppl eating_there too
i_dont know_if the_management changed again
the_place smells of cleaning supply when you_enter
the_buffet_is horrible
its almost_like the_dishes_are fightng for the_worst tasting_food competition
fail
after having an okay dinner_on a_sunday_night
we_ordered dessert here
there_was_an all new wait_staff and they_kept changing the_music from_indian to korean
my_husband_ordered the_dessert called ras malai
he started to_eat_it and_then it kept tasting worse and worse to_him
i_tried_it and_i threw up in_my napkin
it_was awful
when_i called the_waiter over to_tell him that_the ras malai had gone bad he said_that
i_thought_that it_looked a_little iffy
but brought_it out anyway
wtf
even our kid had taken a_bite when_we first got_it
husband spent the night_in the_bathroom to_say_the least
what_a bloody awful experience_here
i_am really questioning the freshness of_all foods here now
yuck
their recommendation of_paneer tika_masala was_fabulous
nice portion
its not_too big
cafe_krishna has always_been a_regular destination for_me
along_with_the food the_staff_was_very_friendly
now
all the_old staff has gone and the_new staff as hard as they_are trying_it isn't working
the_food_is_not what_it use to_be
i_hope to come_by again and_see that_they_have found their lost spark
cold food
hard idli
watery sambar chutney
used_to love_their thaali
could use a_better air freshner
closed sadly cafe krishna's service went down hill in_the_last few_months and_they_have now closed
hopefully the replacement will_be as_good as krishna was before the_change in staff
closed
so sad to_see_this excellent restaurant close
it_was veggie only but_the_food_was so_good you didn't_even miss having meat
o
some_of_my brown brothers
it's ok
close friends can actually talk_about each others' races in good fun
but_that's another topic
recommended this_place_to me
the_food_was_pretty_good for_dinner but pretty overpriced as_well
the_little side condiments on_the_table were_great though
there_is_a waiter
owner
there who looks like_me
asian
but speaks like_an_indian
awesome
god bless america
this is_my_favorite_indian_restaurant in_the_area by far
they_serve quality_food with amazing flavors
i_am_a vegetarian
and_they_offer so_many good entrees that it's_hard_to choose one
their_lunch_buffet has a_variety_of selections
and they_always change them up
so_it's different each time
the_service_is_always excellent too
they_are prompt to_take your_order and serve your_food
the_best indian_food_in_the_valley
we moved_here years_ago and_never found an_indian_restaurant we_liked until this_place
now we_are regulars
i_had_the_chicken coconut curry
it_was_delicious
i_got_the medium heat one_and i_had_some sweat on_my forehead
my_family liked_it too
i'm happy_to find_an indian_food_restaurant that i_like
very_close_to my_house
before eating_at indian paradise
i_couldn't say_i had_ever eaten_indian_food while listening to 's techno
but that's_all changed now
i_can't explain the staff's choice_of music the_night i_visited indian paradise
but_it made_for interesting ambiance
maybe aloo mattar just tastes better to_the tune of
sandstorm
by darude
i found_this_place while on_a mad hunt to_satisfy an_indian_food craving
i swear
when that hits me
i_can think_of little else
it's nestled in_the heart of_what seems_like chandler's chinatown
and_took some effort_to find
i'm_sure that's more due_to my poor sense_of direction
the_decor_was minimal
and_i_don't mean minimalist just white walls_and not_much else
the_food_was_good_and the service_was_attentive
i've_had better garlic_naan
but_it surely wasn't_bad
the_portion_sizes were generous enough_for my_sister and_i to split our_dishes and_still have_some leftovers
i'll be_back_for sure
but i'm_still happy trying other_indian_places in_the_valley
haven't found one i'm completely loyal to yet
if_you_are coming for atmosphere then move along
when we_visited on_a_saturday_night a_few_weeks back we_were_the_only diners eating in_the_restaurant for_the st mins of_our_meal
but frankly who cares
i_am_a nut for chicken_tikka_masala_and this_place does the_best in_the_valley period
the_naan_bread_was maybe a_little_too dry but_what did_i care when_i_was dipping it_in such deliciousness
i_won't go anywhere else for_indian_food now
oh what sadness the_day that this_restaurant decided_to move their business to_the north scottsdale branch
we_always used_to order indian_food from_indian paradise chandler because they_made delicious naan
basmati_rice_and all_things indian_curry
for_what it's_worth go check_out_the scottsdale branch if_you_are_in_the area
i_have_yet_to go but_i promised myself that_i_will put_in a_good word for_this_restaurant once_i open my yelp account
living_in chandler i_know that_i will_be_going to_the scottsdale branch as_soon_as_i have reason to_go in_that direction
this_is_a brand new_indian_restaurant specializing in grilled food
it's funny because there's a_lot_of mexican painted ceramic tile around the_windows and bathroom
remnants of investments from the_previous
failed
owners
the grill's portions_are very_generous for_a reasonable cost
for entr es
if_you_want it hot_and spicy
they_are happy_to oblige
great breads and_sauces and_not_too long prep times
yes
they_are new_and working out_some kinks in the_service
but_i definitely see a_lot_of potential here
quite an_interesting experience
unlike almost_all indian_pakistani places_i've_been to in_my_life
this was_pretty much the_only_one where food_was plated in such_a way as_to evoke top chef
the_food_came on
square i_think
plates rather than_in dishes_and_the presentation_was excellent
the_food_was_good
not_quite what_i_was used_to but ok
those_of you without traditional desi tastes will_be more pleased i_think but that's_just my_opinion
we ordered_the_tandoori platter and for_the_first_time it_came on plates
not sizzling
we_asked about_that and it_seems to_be_a cost and ease decision
just fyi if that's your favorite
i_would_recommend the lentil_soup and pappadums most
the_two are filling enough_for a_meal
what made_the largest and_best impression though was_the courtesy of_the owner's son politeness
friendliness
response time can't_be beat
incredibly good_for casual dining
the_flavors_are exceptional
the_menu_is very inexpensive
they_were realistic about the_heat of_the_dishes
i_loved_the mango juice which complimented the_spiciness_of my chicken_vindaloo very nicely
it reminded me_of eating in_nyc
which_is perhaps the_best compliment i_can give as_an east coast transplant
this_review_is_for_the lunch_buffet_here at india's grill
the_restaurant_is nice_inside
modern looking with it's
open pipe
ceiling
such_as is popular around here right_now
soft indian_music played in_the_background
both booths tables are available_for seating
my_server brought over plenty of_hot
seasoned naan_bread as i_went_for some_of their vegetable soup
to find_that only tiny bowls were available to_get_some of_it in
not_only that
the_soup spoons
at least the_one_i was_given
were_just the_opposite
huge
almost serving spoon size
back at_the booth
the_table was_too far away
if you pulled it_in to_be_the right distance out_on one side
you_could drive a mahindra truck through on_the_other side without running over desirupa's feet
then
back over at the_serving table
some_of_the foods were labeled some not
ok
so stars we're out_of here
right
well
not_so fast
for_one
the_soup in_the thimble
ur
tiny bowl
was_delicious
the_salad actually_had salad dressing available_for it
which_is amazing for an_indian_buffet
the temperature of_everything was_about right
the_foods weren't too soupy
as_they sometimes are at these places
the_taste_of everything_was excellent for the_most_part
if a_little salty
they_do fix it real spicy here
so_if_you come
leave the_kids at mcdonald's keep your glass_of_water
a forehead napkin
close at hand
lunch_buffet
includes hot indian_style tea
wow i_didn't_think you_could mess up indian_food_this badly
i_came_here after a_quick glance at_the reviews_here so_i_was optimistic
we_arrived late only_two other_tables occupied
so_i realize i_was pushing my luck on 'fresh cooked'
we stuck to basics
the papadums arrived_and they_were_good stars_for this
not freshly cooked
but crispy_and not oily
we_ordered_the chicken_tandoori
a paratha bread
and_some appetizers
the appetizers_were dry_and powdery but let's just ignore those
the paratha bread looked freshly prepared
and_had_a decent texture
but tasted like it_has_been cooked_in oil that had_been used and abused way_too much
i'm all_for tasty oil
this_was just weird
the_taste_was awful
but the_tandoori_chicken_was the_worst
the_chicken arrived with 'stuff' piled on_top_of it tomatoes
onions
some_kind_of 'sauce' i_guess so the_chicken_was all goopy and wet
not the_texture you_expect for_something supposedly taken straight out_of_a super hot oven
my guess is
they didn't_want_to fire up the_tandoori oven
so just microwaved a_bunch_of chicken pieces_and dumped some stuff on top
i_drove all_the_way from scottsdale at pm on_a_friday_night for_this
i_was born raised in england
and_now reside primarily in_the_bay_area
home to_many indians
so i_feel_like i_know_what a_good_indian meal should taste_like
i_was_in town visiting my_family_and we_stopped here to_try_it
the_owners used_to live next_to my_parents
we_have_been meaning to_try_the place_so we_did
the_food_and service_was_excellent
the_selection was_great_and i_do like that_you_can see the_kitchen from_the dinning room
that's always comforting for_a patron
the_dishes_we enjoyed were
the vegetable_samosas awesome
garlic paneer naan the_garlic_naan_is sooo much better
chicken tandori great_flavor
chana_masala great
vegetable_biryani great
baigan bharta awesome
they_also provide an_awesome spicy green sauce_that goes great on everything
if_you_are_a fan_of_indian try_this_place
if_you_are looking for_something different
try_this_place
i_will_be_back
have_been here_several_times
both for_the_lunch_buffet_and dinner
service_can_be a_little_slow
generally a_pretty quiet restaurant
but_the people_working there_are more_than polite
overall
i_think the_food_is_very_good especially like the_chicken_tandoori
butter_chicken_and the_fresh cooked naan
our_first experience_with indian_cuisine
and_we will_go_back
we explained that_it_was our_first_time when we_came_in and_the_staff_was supremely understanding and_took their time telling us what_was in_the_food
there_is_a great_selection_of vegetarian_dishes
the_menu_is reasonably_priced
just under for naan
entrees
and_dessert
we never_had empty water_glasses
we really_enjoyed_the_food
can't say what it's supposed_to taste_like because we've never_had_indian before tonight
but_we can_say_that we_really liked our_dishes
the_garlic_naan_was yum and the_malai_kofta i_ordered was easily made without onions
upon request
and_my husband's food_was spicy_enough for_him that he_didn't complain about_it being weak
dessert was_not up_my alley
but hubbie happily finished_eating my portion
we'll go_back
and we'll take people with_us when_we do
nice_atmosphere
fantastic_service and_more importantly flavorful_and delicious_food
we_had_the chilling chicken and_garlic_naan
this_is quite possibly the_most delicious_indian i_have_ever_had
highly_recommend
great_food
been_here twice_and have_liked everything_i have eatin
last_time_i couldn't decide and asked_the_waiter to_pick something for_me_and surprise me
whatever he picked was_great
lots_of taste_and very_filling
service_is_great
they_all take good care_of you
this_place_is wonderful
fantastic_service
they explain things for_those of_you who_are new_to_indian_food
better_than any_other_indian place i_have_tried and i_have_tried alot
open kitchen so_you_can see_them cooking and_the_place_was very_clean
the_garlic_naan is_a_must_try
my_husband is_not a_fan_of_indian_food but_he enjoyed the_tandori mixed_grill and_the kema naan
we_will_be going_back_for more soon
i really_enjoyed_the_food
they provide a nice_selection and_the_price is_great
the_atmosphere_was a_little lacking
but_the_staff was_very_nice
my_husband didn't_care_for it
but he's not_a_big_fan_of indian_food
i_will absolutely be_back_for the_garlic_naan
yum
really really_enjoyed_the buffet at_this_place
good_stuff and_all quality_ingredients
we tend to_eat_at a_lot_of_indian places and_this_place_is definately quality for arizona
we discovered_this_place about six months_ago via restaurant
com after trying virtually every_other indian_restaurant_in gilbert
chandler and mesa and_not finding one_that stands up_to_the great_indian_food we_had when_we lived in_the_bay_area
this is_by_far_the_best here_and comes closest to_the amazing indian_food we_enjoyed in california
the_chicken_tikka and_chicken_tikka_masala are outstanding
as_is_the naan_bread
the_chana_masala is quite_good
too
we_only order_off_the_menu
haven't tried_the_buffet
and_i've now been_back dozens of_times
and have_taken friends_and family
they_all agree this_is_the_best they've had_here in_the_phoenix_area
service is_decent as_well
nice family that runs it
oh
and_if you're worried that indian_food_is too_spicy_for you
just ask_them to_make_it
super mild
they_are able_to_get it_right and make_it so_i_can eat_it
and i_don't_like spicy_food at_all
i_may bump this_place up_to stars on my_next_visit
the presentation was_very_good
the_food smelled great
the_service_was_very_good
my criticisms are that_the mixed_grill was_mostly overdone
not_so_much that_it_was bad
it was_very_flavorful
but the_shrimp was chewy and_the_lamb_was overdone as_well
the_garlic_naan_was awesome
the_chicken_tikka was_very_flavorful and_was_very different_than other_places i've_had it
the_portion on_the naan_was_great
less so on the_tikka and_the mixed_grill
the_place has a_nice
open layout and features accents of broken plates worked into_the columns and_other areas
it_was_good
i_have_only eaten_here twice with some_friends and_family
i_can_say this though
the_chicken_vindaloo was_amazing
i_ordered_it spicy the_way god intended it
awesome
if_you're_a novice don't_even try to_order spicy though
you'll die
also the_chicken_tikka_masala was_a_little slice of heaven
this is_the_best_indian_restaurant around
i_have_been_to every indian_restaurant_in_town
i_used_to go_to_indian paradise and guru palace regularly
then_i started going_here
this_is_the_only indian_restaurant in_phoenix that uses real lamb
not beef
check the_texture at_other_places next_time
the_flavor is_incredible
most_importantly the_owners_are great people
i_have become very_good friends with_them the_past year
i bring all my_friends there and_they_are well taken_care of
this_is_my_favorite place_to_eat
i_recommend_the lamb_saag
lamb boti masala
and_lamb_vindaloo with paneer naan
hope to_see all_of you_guys there
you_will_not be dissapointed
when_i entered at normal dinner_time
there_was_only other customers than my_party
i_was_really worried that_the_food would_be horrible and_a waste of a_groupon
i_ordered_the usual dishes_i would_get with my_parents
garlic_naan
onion kulcha
mattar_paneer
palak_paneer
and chana_masala
each of_the_dishes had_an unique taste than_what_i expected
it_tasted different
but it_was_good
my major negative is we_asked_for medium_spice and_the_food_was very_mild
in_addition
i_had_to_try really hard to_try_the garlic in the_garlic_naan
the_food_comes in decent portion
but it_might_be a_couple bucks overpriced per dish
i_would_come here_again to_try_some non vegetarian_dishes or the_buffet
wow
i_had_a taste for_indian and_just happened_to stumble upon the_lunch_buffet
for
i_had_an unbelievabe lunch
a_decent
but_not exhausted selection_of popular indian_dishes
what amazed me_is that_every one i_sampled was_excellent
and_then they_brought_out bread
as_if the_buffet wasn't enough
i'll be_back often
love_it
first_of all_the_food is_wonderful
every_time_we go we try something different_and have_yet_to be_disappointed
i_recommend_the lamb_masala
spicy of_course
and_my_husband loves the_chicken_vindaloo
dinner is_great here_with nice sized portions
lunch has_a_great buffet available
which offers different options each time
giving us the_chance_to try new_dishes
i_would_have_to say the_best_part is_the_service
india grill is_clearly run_by a very_kind family who knows how to_take care_of their_customers
we once went to_the_lunch_buffet a_bit close_to_the end lunch service
they_were serving one_of_my very favorites
lamb tekka masala
but_they_were pretty much out
when_i_asked the_server
a young guy_who always serves us_and is_awesome
if_they would_be replenishing this_dish
he said he_would see_what he could_do
and promptly returned with my_own mini serving of_the_dish
if he_had come_back_and said they_were_not replenishing i_would_have totally understood
but as_always the_staff went above and beyond
with_all_the indian_food options in_the_valley
we continue_to return over_and over knowing we will_always receive amazing_service
go_there
now
you won't regret_it
garlic_naan_bread and bbq flavored chicken
tastes ok but_not looking to_eat american food
don't_get_me_wrong the_garlic bread_was tasty_but unexpected when_i mixed it with_my curry_chicken
boo
went_here on_a_saturday afternoon and_there_were of_us
i_don't_really care_for buffet_food at_indian_restaurants
so_we_had take_out
the_place_looks good_enough from_the inside
but_i_was extremely disappointed_by_the food
all_of_the naan_were burnt on_the underside
the kofta curry_had coconut in_it
which is_kind_of odd
not_to_mention all of_us_had stomach problems the_very next day
now if it_was_just one_person
then_i can understand
but_as all_three of_us felt sick
i_have_no doubt in my_mind that_it_was their_food
will_never try_this_place again
my_husband i_love_this_place
service
food
and cleanliness of restaurant are_all great
the_malai_kofta and lamb_korma with some_garlic_naan on_the side
my_mouth is already watering
we've tried almost all_the_indian places_in_the mesa chandler gilbert area_and this_one_is awesome
did_i_mention great_prices for_the_amount_of_food you_get
we_have also been given several complimentary sides just_because
very_nice staff
still haven't had_a_bad dish off their_menu and_i've tried just_about all_of_it
maybe this_place deserves stars
but i'm_not_a connoisseur when_it_comes_to indian_food_i only know that_this_place serves up_some great dishes
my favorite_is_the mixed_grill and_my_wife loves the_butter_chicken
the_naan_bread appetizers are extremely yummi and_the_prices_are reasonable
the_dining_room isn't anything to_write_home_about
but_it's fun to_watch the_indian music_videos on_the big tvs
and_the_service_is very_friendly_and_attentive
will_be_back
my_wife_and have_been_to pretty much every indian_restaurant in_phoenix
we_go almost every_week
since we_went_here
we_have never_went anywhere else
except when traveling
the_food_here_is fantastic
the_staff has_always been_great
but_the_food
oh the_food
did_i say it_was_fantastic
my_personal favorite_is_the baigan bharta
my wife's is the_paneer tika_masala
but
all is_great
i give_this_place stars
but_i'd rather say
since i've_only been_there once
i_think_the extra
points is_for potential
i_like indian_food_and i_like_it enough to_eat_it when_i can
don't_get_me_wrong
i'm no indian_food connoisseur but i_really_like bold tasting_food with_lots_of spices_and flavors
and_i_really
really_like my_curry
i_came_in here_on my_lunch break
skeptical of_what i'd find from an_indian_buffet
not_too bad
your basic selection_of chicken_tikki_masala
coconut curry
lentils
indian bbq
etc
overall
taste was_nice_and satisfied my hunger pangs
on_the_other_hand
i'm_not sure_i like_how they_made their_naan
it_tasted_like garlic bread
looked_like some pita overloaded with parsley
and_was_not soft like i've_had at_other_places
but_that's okay
because_i filled myself up on_the_buffet
service_was fast_and friendly
and_the_atmosphere_is comfortable
maybe a_little_too big for_its own sake
but_hey
that's quite all right
closed
this_location has closed
i'm usually stay far away from buffets
however i_am_very happy i_decided_to_give this_place_a_try
my_mom and_i_were both in_the_mood to_try_some place new_and after driving around_and checking_out all_of commerical center we_decided a indian_food sounded pretty yummy
after eating_there
i decide this_really is_the_only way_to_go out for_indian_food with_just people because_i always want_to try just a_little_bit_of_everything
at_namaste you_can
and everything_i tasted was_fantastic
eat here_for_lunch
lunch_buffet
really amazing_food
good_service
i_can't_wait_to_go_back
the_food_was_excellent and_it's probably the_best_indian_buffet in_las_vegas so_far
this_restaurant_is very new
so_i'm_not sure_if their quality will degrade over time
i_have_seen a_lot_of new restaurants made great_food when_they just_opened but_then their food_quality went down hill as time goes by
i_hope it's_not true for_this_restaurant because_i truely enjoyed_my lunch
i_will update my rating if their quality changes
this_place_was so hyped up that i_was_expecting something out_of_this_world delicious
my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in the_entire world is bombay club in harvard square
delicious
in my_eyes
you_can't beat it
so
i_came_in here_with high hopes
this_was_the_first indian_restaurant i've tried in_vegas
it's right_next_to lotus of siam
and right away that_was a_good_sign for_me
anything_that someone in_my group_of foodie friends recommends that is_in_a seedy strip_mall has_to_be good
started off_with_a kingfisher beer
papadom
and_the requisite sauces
friend of_mine got_the mulligatawny soup
i_didn't try_it
but_he said_it_was good
for_dinner
i_got_the_chicken vindaloo_and kheema naan
lamb stuffed bread
i_asked them to_make_the vindaloo as hot as they_could
and i_didn't_have a_problem eating_it
wasn't_as spicy_as i_thought it'd be
i_mean
it_was_spicy
but_it_wasn't like oh_my god im going_to die if i_dont get water right_now aigdjgsadjg kind of_spicy
na'mean
overall
though
high_quality food_for_a very low price
i_was impressed_with_the place and_i'll definitely be_going back again
the best_indian_food_in_vegas
my_girlfriend and_i_were accidentally one_of_the first people to_eat_at namaste
we_were in_the_area_and are_very familiar_with the_great places_in_the tucked_away commercial center
as_i recall we_were considering going_to komol
one_of_our favorite thai food restaurants_and hangouts
when_we saw_that namaste was finally open
we_both love_indian_food as_she primarily eats vegetarian_and indian_restaurants_are easy targets for_us
the_lunch_buffet_for is_not to_be missed
indian_buffets are hit_or_miss
some will put_out the_standard dishes and_only have_one or_two really yummy entrees set out
not namaste
they pull out all_the stops and have_many favorite_dishes out at the_same_time
mind you
the_place_is new
and many new places will start out this_way and_then go downhill
but_i_don't_think this will_be the_case with namaste
chef and owner
om singh
has_a reputation that precedes him in_the culinary world and_i suspect that the_quality at_namaste will endure
we_have_eaten here_many_times since it_has opened up_and every meal has_been outstanding
most notably
the_vegetarian dinner_for_two
is_perfect
from_the first course to the_last it_is exceptionally yummy
the main_courses are_all super good_and it_was_so plentiful we had_a_lot_of left_overs for_lunch_the_next_day
and the_dessert
especially the_carrot one
is_really_good
the_wait_staff is_very_friendly_and are constantly circling the_floor
the_atmosphere_is decent and_comfortable
i attend a discussion group every sunday_afternoon and we_usually go_out to_dinner afterward
komol is one_of_our regular haunts
but_now it_seems that namaste will_be our new default location
i_really love_this_place
me and_my_friend went here_for_the_lunch_buffet a_couple weeks_ago after finding a coupon_for it_in one_of_the vegas booklets
i_think_the coupon might've been buy get free
it_was_a really good_deal
once you_walk_in
you_enter a somewhat small dining_area with dark walls_and dark furniture which gave_it_a pretty nice_ambiance
once you_are seated
you_just get up_and go over to_the_buffet area
it_looks pretty_small
but_what they_have is_more than_enough
i_tried everything that was_in_the buffet_and_it_was all_delicious
i_tried_to eat as_much_as_i possibly could because it_was_so_good
my_favorite_was_the palak panneer
it_was_just incredible
i_made trips to_the_buffet just to_get more and_more of_that
i_was_so stuffed
i definitely_recommend the_lunch_buffet_for anyone that wants a_nice taste of_indian_food for_a low price
i_will_be_back here asap once_i find someone to_go_with me
if_this_is
best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
i_will_go for some_other cuisine
daal very_good
bhindi good
pakoras dry
salty
chicken kabab dry
rest average
if you drink beer
try kingfisher in standard oz bottle
avoid indian_beers that come_in larger bottles
this refers to_the_lunch_buffet only at this_time
what you_need_to know
a_nice indian_place conveniently located next_to lotus of siam
warm decor_and very_friendly_and competent staff
weird hours
grab_a takeout menu_and write them down
good_selection_of buffet_items
especially_the lamb_dishes
given_that there_are few good indian_places
this is_a_must_try
downsides
some_dishes get a_bit cool on_the_buffet_line
think deep_fried veggies
right next_door_to one_of_the best restaurants_in_town
given_a choice
commercial center
not_a superb location
definitely worthy of another go
luncheon buffet i_sampled the_pakora
indian pickles
raita
tamarind and_mint sauces
fresh_naan
basmati_rice
chicken_and_lamb curries
saag
sambar and gajar halwa
we_have never dined at an_indian_buffet in_las_vegas
but it_did_not compare well to the_ones we frequent in connecticut
this_is_not_the best_indian_food_in_vegas
i'm disappointed to_say
the_buffet has not changed since folks last reviewedin fact it_was_the same lineup
the_service_was poor
i_asked_the waiter_for garam masala rice
basic white basmati with hot spices
but_he could_not make_it happen
my_family had never_been_to an_indian_place and_they loved_it
could_not stop talking about finally eating the_lamb
got_to love_the holidays
final review
basic indian_buffet
per_person is_an expensive lunch in_this town
could_be done a_lot better
one_star
was trying to_go_to lotus of siam next door
but line was too_long
so we_went_here instead
which_i assume is how_they get most_of_their biz
food_was_good but_nothing really stood out over other_indian joints
my_boyfriend_and_i shared the_veggie dinner_for
which_was
service_was_good
restroom is_very_clean
place_is nicely_decorated
went_for_dinner with folks
service spotty
starters awful
main course was_ok
mom ordered chardonnay
for which the_only descriptive word she_could find was
ganges
i_am told_that lunch_buffet_is good
i would_not_recommend for_dinner
judging from_the range_of scores from_other reviewers i_think your liking of namaste might be based on_a particular preference toward indian_food done a specific way
i_couldn't quite put my finger on what_it_was
but_i_just didn't enjoy my_meal here very_much
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was filled_with huge chunks_of dark meat chicken
i'm_not usually a_fan_of dark meat but indian_cuisine usually gets it_to really blend with the_sauces and_spices
this wasn't the_case here it_was_like tasteless brown meat dipped on sauce
meat_and veg_dishes on_the_lunch_buffet were_ok
but_a_little odd paneer mixed in with_a dry sort of_veg offering was_a_little unusual and_out of_place
overall ok
but_not in my_first few choices_for vegas_indian
had_very high hopes for_this_place based_on_the rave reviews of_our local food critics
unfortunately
i gotta give_it_a big thumbs down
went_for_the_lunch_buffet so that_is all_i_can speak about
all_the veggie_dishes were_super bland
garbanzo bean dish_was best_of the bunch but_that_was it
butter_chicken was_also_good
the_tandori
sp
chicken_was grey and completely unappealing looking
naan was_fine but_very greasy
if_you_like spicy_food like_i do
this_is_not_the place for_you
not_sure where all_the raves come for_this_place dinner_menu maybe
i_like_the nearby india_oven better for_the_lunch_buffet
all places have_good and bad days so ymmv as_the cliche goes
quite_a bargin for
the_buffet_was fresh
and_was served_with_a basket_of warm
buttery naan
the_saag_paneer was_very_good
and_the_butter_chicken was_a mildly spiced curry_in a_rich sauce
the_decor_is simple_and dark
a_good_place for a_date
excellent_food
i'm_not_a particular fan_of_indian_food but i_must_say that this_is_definitely the_best_i've_ever tasted
me_and_my fiancee came_here_for v day after hearing it_was_one_of_the most romantic restaurants_in_vegas
the_location
sahara and commercial center
is a_bit_of_a grungy area but_we go_there to_eat_at komol's quite often so the_less than romantic exterior didn't bother me too_much
the_interior_is dimly lit and_pretty cozy as_well
we_got seated_right away_and had our_orders taken within the_next minutes
we_had_a vegetable
carrot
onion
and parsley
ensemble for_our starter dishes_which was_quite spicy_but very_tasty
i_also_had the_vegetarian stir fry which_was brought out_on_a steaming hot plate_and smelled just as_good_as_it tasted
this_dish had_a typical stir fry 'onion y' taste_and came complete with cauliflower
red and_green peppers
grilled tofu
and_more parsley
my_main dish_was a_vegetarian curry_and it_was_awesome
i_also_had garlic_naan_and kashmiri naan which_was_also killer
the kashmiri naan_was naan with_a cherry like filling and_it_wasn't too_sweet
complementing the buttery naan exterior very nicely
i_also_had the_rice_pudding for_dessert and_it_was standard like_other rice puddings i've_had before
food aside
the_service_was_pretty good
they_were a_bit_slow in bringing our_food out and_that_was a_bit irritating
we_were_there_for almost hours and_we_are definitely_not slow eaters
they_got my_order wrong three_times during our_visit
the_wine was the_wrong one and_decided_to let that_one slide but they_brought_out the_wrong appetizer_and wrong curry
still_not sure_how that happened
but_i let them know i_got_the wrong dishes and_they gladly replaced them with_the right ones and_pretty quickly
at_that
they_also added a percent discount on_our bill and_gave us extra naan
now that's service
we_didn't ask_for the discount or_naan so that_was_a real pleasant surprise
they_had_a valentine's special going so dishes_and a_dessert with_a glass_of_wine came_out_to be a_person which_was actually pretty_good considering_the regular prices of_the plates which averaged around dollars each
overall
the_service_was a_little_slow but good_and_the food_was_awesome
definitely coming_back_to experience namaste again in_the_future
not_bad at_all
i_only heard_of this_place_because of restaurant
com's deal coupon's
i'm_always looking_for new places so_when this came up i_figured
wth
glad_i_did too
i_went_with my girl and some_friends and_got orders_of the
dinner_for
the_food_was top_notch
very_yummy
the_only drawback was the_service
now are waters were always full_and such but_that_was from_the busboy
the_server left much to_be_desired
now i'm_not one_to like the_server there every seconds asking how it_was but damn this guy_was slow on everything_and in_the_end he ended up taking my coupon and splitting it between us and_the_other couple
without asking
needless_to say i_was_not thrilled about_that
will i_go_back
for_the_food
yes
but_not_the service
fantastic lunch_buffet for_the_price
friendly_staff
delicious butter_chicken_and some crazy carrot salad dish_that is_like crack i couldnt stop
yum
my boss recommended this_indian_restaurant to_me_and also the_chicken_korma while_i_was there
i_ended_up getting the_chicken_korma along_with bombay salad
tandoori shrimp
on_the pricier side
and_garlic_naan
so_delicious
the_garlic_naan_was fantastic
the_service wasn't anything spectacular
but i_really_enjoyed_the meal pretty thoroughly
stars_for great dishes
stepped into this_place_for_a pre show dinner because there_was_a wait at lotus of siam next door_and will_definitely be going_back_for more
for_appetizers
entrees
premium beers and a_dessert our bill_was
we_had_the vegetable_pakora
onion bahji paneer naan to_start things off
while we_waited the_waiter_brought out_some popadoms on_the house with_a sweet sauce_and spicy_sauce
nice
for_our main_courses we_had_the chicken_vindaloo
chicken potatoes stewed with curry over_rice
chicken biriani
chicken
cashew nuts
vegetables
basmati_rice
i_enjoyed everything_we_had
and though_it_was probably_a mistake to_get fried appetizers the_pakora bhaji were_great the_naan_bread_was soft_and tasty
the_vindaloo
for_me
was_perfect
it_was spicy_but_not overpowering
and the_flavors really came through in_the_sauce along_with_the tender_and juicy chicken
it_may not_be as_spicy as_some lotus regulars are used_to but i_thought_it_was spot_on
the only_complaint my gf had_about her dish_was that_it could_have used more cashews
i_was skeptical when_she ordered the_carrot based dessert
but_was surprised_at how_good it_was
probably_the healthiest dessert you will_ever eat
the service_was_quick and_friendly
and i_hope this_place sticks around
it_didn't seem that busy at ish on_a_tuesday
though we_were surprised to_see_the mayor and_his wife walk through_the door_and sit at_the adjacent booth midway through our_meal
my_fav indian_food_restaurant for_dinner we_had_the tasting set dinner_for_two people and_everything_was soooo flavorful
the_chicken_tikka_masala tasted_great
i_suppose they_make it_with really flavorful tandoori_chicken
and_the_sauce has_a_great depth in taste
the_spinach paneer_and lamb was_also savory
and_you_can really have_a_good taste_of_the spices from their_dishes
went_there last_week for_the_buffet
everything_was good_but_not a_lot_of variety
dinner was_better
indian_lunch_buffets were_on my_mind
especially have hearing misti y
praise their deliciousness
we pull into commercial center at
pm_on_a sunday
as_we park the car
we notice there aren't too many_other cars parked out front
hmmm
as_we open the_door
what_a shock to_see
the_place_was_packed full_of indians
this was_a_great sign
i_wasn't sure_if there_was_a wait with_all_the people standing around of if there_was_a private party
with_no one_to greet us at_the_front
the_husband goes in_search_of an_empty table
he finds one last table at_the far back_and after checking with_a waiter
i_get_the affirmative wave
i tell him to_start first on_the_buffet_line
meanwhile
i ask a_waiter for_some utensils
when the_waiter brings over our_water
he apologizes as_a tour group had_just arrived
which explains all_the craziness
nonetheless
an_indian tour group stops at_namaste in commercial center
of_all places
for_their_lunch en route is_still a_good_sign
my turn at the_buffet_line
now
i'm no expert_on_indian buffets as i've_been_to only a_couple
but_i_think_the spread was_pretty_good for
my_favorite_was_the vegetable_korma
vegetable cooked_in creamy cashew nut gravy finished with almond and garnished with coriander and cream
this was_good on rice_or the hot_naan
unleavened white bread
they provided
i also_liked the_sauce from the_chicken_tikka_masala
tender pieces_of chicken_breast roasted in homemade creamy tomato
however
we_both found the_chicken pieces itself to_be dry
i_also liked_the allo jerra
which_were ultimately potatoes
the_husband was loving the_saag_paneer
spinach cooked_with homemade cheese
and the_goat_curry
other_items on_the_buffet_line were pakara
a fried veggie
cholle masala
a_dish with chickpeas
and_a cabbage masala
something_that was both new to_us was_the uttapam
a thick pancake with_a sour like taste that_was topped with a_bit_of tomato and_onion
traditionally it's made_from rice_that has_been fermented
which explains it's tangy taste
finishing off the_meal_was the_kheer
traditional_indian rice_pudding with_nuts
flavored with cardamon and rose
at_one point
i helped myself to_the water pitcher
i_wasn't sure_if this_was self serve since_there were_about four water pitchers right_next_to where_we were sitting and_the_place_was so crowded
they_did end_up refilling my glass the_next times though
the_waiters were_pretty friendly to_us once the_crowd got settled in more and started clearing out
they_were quick to_clear out our dirty dishes_and refill the water_glasses
namaste also_has a_simple
but pleasant decor with_its mango painted walls
which i'm_sure makes one crave a_mango_lassi
overall
definitely not_a_bad choice_for an_indian_buffet
i_was_so stuffed from_that meal that_i_didn't eat again until_pm that_night
i_don't_know_if it's_always this busy on sundays though
so keep that in_mind
waking up late on_a_sunday afternoon
and influenced by the_wife and_some comments from misti y
we decided_that our_first meal of_the_day was_going_to_be some_indian_food at_namaste
the_restaurant_is located_in_the commercial center right_next_to lotus of siam
we_were reassured to_find_the place packed full_of hungry eaters
mostly of_indian descent
we later found_out that most_of_the diners were from_a tour group
we were_a_bit worried about_how we were_going_to score a_table
luckily
there_was one empty table_to be_found near the_end_of_the buffet_line
the_food looked and smelled incredible
i_was starving
but_i had_to_wait in_line
there_was so_much to_choose_from for_this
lunch_buffet
i_just followed suit and placed whatever everybody else ahead of_me was grabbing
i couldn't_stop dipping my hot buttery naan into the_green chutney
it_was tangy with_a minty finish
i_also enjoyed heaps of_my_favorite saag_paneer
creamy spinach with chunks_of cheese
usually
at buffets
i_find the_saag_paneer to_be dried out
but here it_was_very wet
for meat
i_really_liked_the goat_curry
the_meat_was pungent and very_tender
the_sauce_was tasty_and spicy_and compliment well_with_the rice
the_dish that i_did_not enjoy was the_chicken_curry
those pieces_of chicken_breast was_so dry
even though they_were submerged in_all that curry_sauce
this_is great_place_to_go for an_indian_lunch_buffet
we_will_definitely_be_back
i_hope to_return for_dinner at least to_sample my_other favorite_indian dish
lamb_biryani and wash that down_with a_mango_lassi
this_is_a place you_have_to try
we_usually go a_couple_of_times per month for_their_lunch_buffet
we_always eat too_much of their_food
last time_we_were_there
the_server came_by with something_that he wanted us to_try and_the_sauce to_go_with it
i_thought_it_was so_nice that he_would go_out_of his way during_the_lunch_buffet
but his tip did increase
so_maybe that_was his point
great_service
great_food
let's keep this_place in business
sweet_and simple
this_place_is fantastic
my_boyfriend told_me about_this_place so_we_decided_to go
i_hadn't eaten india food in_a_while so_i_was up for_something different
anything you_try you_will like
they_also ask you how_spicy you_would like_your food_and it_came_out perfect
i had_the_chicken_tikka_masala
amazing
it_was lil spicy and_full_of_flavor
my_boyfriend had_the_lamb in_a cashew gravy with the_garlic_naan
it_was_so_good
we_finished everything_and didn't_feel full
i would_definitely_recommend_this_place to_anyone_looking_for something different besides bar food
stars in_my_book
oh and_the_staff_was great
very_nice_and fast service
we_will_be_back very_soon
i've_been_to namaste once_and had_the_lunch_buffet
the_food seemed_very stale and_the_quality passable
not_at_all something we'd frequent again
the topper is the_fact_that namaste has_been shut down multiple_times for health code violations
that_just does not sit will with_me
the recent reviews seem_to suggest the_food_has improved
i'm not_sure about_that as_i don't dare eat_there after my_first_experience and_their hygiene issues
coming_from a tourist's perspective
namaste was a_welcome refuge from_the crap on_the_strip
also obviously goes a_lot farther elsewhere
we_ordered_the aloo tikee appetizer after they_were_out_of veggie_samosas and we_were_not_disappointed
i_had lamb_tikka_masala and my_girlfriend had the_malai_kofta
everything_was_delicious with a_perfect level_of heat
we_also enjoyed_the dark wood decor and_the_service_was pretty_good
i_don't_know_what it's_like normally because_we_were one of_two tables in_the_place at pm
one caveat
don't order coffee because_they only_have instant
unpretentious decor and_friendly_service more importantly
the_food_is_very_good
order the_chicken_korma
it rocks
you_won't_be sorry you did
the_naan kashmiri was unlike any_other naan i'd had_before
in_a good way
first appearances can_be deceiving
hubby_and_i were feeling a_bit nervous when_we pulled into_the sahara commercial center that_place just looks sad
but oh
everything brightened when_we_walked into namaste and tried_their
lunch_buffet
every single item tasted excellent we filled our_plates with_all kinds_of delicious things_like butter_chicken
navaratna korma
aloo palak
masala mutton
and_then the_waiter_brought us a_basket_of fresh hot butter naan to_the_table
oh_yeah
but it_got even_better
several minutes later
he_brought us_a freshly cooked plate_of uttapam yes you read that right
we_love south_indian snacks and it's_just_not so easy_to find_that here_in_vegas
that little touch pushed us into masala bliss
the_other cool thing that_will draw us back_for a_dinner is_that_they serve quite a_few goan specialties
such_as chicken xacutti and goan shrimp_curry all quite amazing_and different_from their northern_indian style counterparts
happy eating
tandoori_chicken here is_awesome
i've been several_times but it's_been months so_when i_went_back i_was suprised to_see they changed ownership
we_were_greeted by a_sweet lady who took_our owner
after our_food_was delivered quickly
she serenaded our_table_and others karaoke style
gurl can sang
nice
cute touch so i'll definitely come_back
the_buffet here_is a_really_good deal so_you_can try a_little_bit_of_everything
i d pay a_few bucks more if they_offered my_favorite here lamb_vindaloo
i went_for_the_lunch_buffet to_try_a variety_of_dishes and_they did_not_disappoint
a_perfect balance_of vegetarian and_meat_dishes
there_was a_couple_of dishes_that had_some kick but_not where_it overwhelmed the_dish entirely
i will_be_returning for the_dinner_menu soon
good cooking here
for a_hole in_the_wall place
service_was poor
one_person for the_whole dining
room
cashier and hostess
person doing it_all
i_arrived at pm
sadly they_do_not refresh their_buffet
it_was dried up
it_still tasted fine
but_not very apetizing
so get_there early
and enjoy_the super oily naan
wow
we_stopped_in for_lunch and_we_were pleasantly_surprised
the_lunch_buffet_was great
some indian_buffets only_have a_few basic foods and skimp on the_naan_and chutneys
not this_place
they_had all_of your favorites
plenty of_chutneys and_kept fresh_naan on_our_table the_entire time
i_can't_say enough good_things about_this_place
make_sure_you stop_in for_the_lunch_buffet_and maybe you_will_be lucky enough to_be serenaded by_the nice woman who works here
overall
great_place and_we_will return the_next_time we_are_in vegas
namaste hello
i've been waiting quite awhile to_meet you
i_came today to_try your lunch_buffet
and_it's every bit as_good as_others have commented
i_ate mostly vegetarian_dishes because_they_were so_good and they_came first on_the_buffet
there_wasn't much room_for anything else
well yes there_was
but the_vegetarian selections were_excellent
for plate one
i_had_some saag_paneer
dal maknni
butter_chicken_and another chicken whose name i_can't_remember
note to self bring_a notepad
the_spiciness_of the_first two_dishes the_vegetarian ones was_simply superb
the_spices were_not overpowering but were just_right
there_was_also_a little bite which_is always welcome
for plate two
i_had_some aloo korma
fried cabbage
eggplant bartha
and some_more dal maknni
again
the_flavors_were outstanding
plate three i_tried three of_their chutneys tamarind
coconut
and_mint
they_were_all good
but the_tamarind was_my_favorite
i_used them as_a condiment on_my naan
while it_was_not needed the naan_was_excellent i_did want to_try_the chutneys alone and_this_was the bets option_for me
my_last dish_was a_small bowl_of mango_custard that_was_a perfect ending to the_meal
service_was right_on
dishes_were removed
iced_tea refilled
and_the_waiter checked_on me often to_see_if there_was anything i_needed
the_hostess was_a simply lovely woman who was_very_friendly
she_had to_leave while_i_was eating to_run an errand
and_she came_over_and thanked me_for coming by_and asked_me to_return
top_notch customer interaction
i_will_be_back
now i_need_to nap
again
hello namaste
finally went_here for_the_lunch_buffet_and was_not_disappointed
great_service
liked the_decor_and most_importantly the_food_was_great
and you_cannot beat the_price_of
another_indian lunch_buffet_that i_like is tandoori but this_place_is equivalent and cheaper
thanks namaste
after hearing misti and bobby y
rave about_this_place
we finally_got to_try namaste during misti's cmye in conjunction with_the cac
we_shared a_table with fellow yelpers tony
judd
and lynn
usually the_buffet_is only served during_lunch hours
but they_made an exception for_this event
if you_haven't been_to namaste within the_last months
i_strongly suggest_you do_so
the food_was_outstanding
they_have changed ownership and the_person running the show now is melque
pronounced
milky
rodriguez
she and her cooks are natives from goa
and besides being the_owner
she is_also_a professional singer
and_your friendly hostess and server
the_buffet_had quite a_few meat_and vegetarian_options saag_paneer
veggie_samosas
veggie biriyani
tandoori_chicken
chicken_vindaloo
butter_chicken
ghana chat
yellow dal
navratham korma
the_list goes on and_on
after a_good couple rounds
i_was happily stuffed_and we'll definitely be_back_to_try other items_on_the_menu
aloha
let it be known i'm_not the_biggest fan_of_indian_food
i_don't_like spicy_food
i_hate whatever it_is that_makes curry yellow
tumeric
and_don't get_me started on_the carbs
indian_buffets are typically more pain than pleasure for_me
but i'm_always down_to join a_group at an_indian_buffet every so often for variety sake
i've_been_to or_so indian_buffets in_my_life
but_this_one tops them_all
i_might just bend my
only eat_indian a_few_times a_year
rule for_this_place
the ownership is new ish
they bought the_place back_in june
the_owners_are super sweet
and most_importantly the_food_is_awesome
like_i said
i_don't enjoy indian_food_but i_can't get_their butter_chicken out_of_my head
i've_never_had such amazing butter_chicken before
i put myself in_a disgusting naan butter_chicken food_coma
i_just couldn't_stop eating_it
i_will_say the offerings are relatively small
but_they_are all quality
everything_was fresh_and_tasty and made_with care
while the_food
atmosphere
and price
were_all right on_point
the_highlight_of my_meal was_when the_owner serenaded us_with unforgettable by natalie cole
she literally picked up_a mic
piped in_some back ground music and points to_my table_and says
this_one goes out_to the_three ladies to_my right
lol
sheer awesomeness
i've never seen owner
karaoke
in an_indian_buffet before
the_new owner rocks personable
good_with food
and moonlights as_a lounge singer
i_felt nothing but love the_entire time_we_were_there
yup
it's decided
despite_the carbs ensuing pain from too_much butter_chicken i_might just_have to come_back_here more often
excellent_food
i_loved_the kadai chicken_and malai_kofta
hostess offered_us complimentary rice which_was_nice of her
would prefer to_have_the servers dressed a_bit professionally rather than street clothes
the_new ownership of namaste
improved health department standard as_well as stellar reviews_and recommendations made_me suggest this as_the place_for_a co worker's birthday lunch
i_shared_the yelp link with_all and_we_were waiting with anticipation to partake in_a bevy of_curries and mop that up_with naan
namaste is really_well done up
dark wood paneling
soft muted lighting
cosy booths
i_can_see how this_place could_be the setting for quite the romantic date_night
although indian_food may_not be something you_want_to be_eating on_the first few dates
melque
the_owner_was very_very personable
she checked up_on us multiple_times and sang a song
ungforgettable
during_lunch
yes
it_was_a_little strange and_hard to_talk_to my_table but_she did have_a_good voice and she's just_so sweet
now the_food
i_only ate vegetarian since
i_am vegetarian
a_fairly extensive selection at_namaste so_that was_really_nice
there_were the_usual salads and_chutneys all_of which_were very_fresh
the navaratan korma
mixed vegetable_curry
was really_really_good
the soft basmati_rice with_peas also_very comforting and_the dal_makhani was_creamy and_tasty
i_wasn't a_fan_of the uthapam and sambar
the uthapam was_too sour
i_guess the batter fermented a_little_too long
and_i'm reiterating my_usual complaint that_no restaurant knows what sambar is in_las_vegas
the_aloo_gobi and_spinach and_potato puree were passable
we_got_a basket_of garlic naans that_was tasty_but rather tough and_dry
my co_workers enjoyed_the carnivorous fare but everyone asked_me the_same_thing when_we_left
when are we going_to mount_everest again
i'll definitely be_back as namaste is one_of_the_better buffets in_town_and the_service_and ambiance_is really top_notch
we_got free tickets to_a show at_the hilton last_night_and were_looking_for a_restaurant to_try in_the general area
i've read a_lot_of good_reviews for namaste so_we_decided to_give_it_a_try
i_had thought about going_there a_couple_of_times but_could never bring myself to do_it
i_love los and_just couldn't imagine walking past los to_go_to another_restaurant
i'm glad_i decided to_do_so last_night
we_ordered garlic_naan
chicken biriani
waitress' suggestion house specialty
paneer malai
cheese in_a creamy onion sauce
and kheema mutter
ground lamb_in a curry_sauce
we_were given papadum to_start
it_was_good and i_really_liked_the mint_chutney that accompanied it
i_wasn't as fond of the_tamarind_chutney
but_that's because_i'm not_a_big_fan_of tamarind
my_wife_had a_mango_lassi
she said_it_was good_but that she's had_better
she prefers hers a_little thicker and sweeter
the_garlic_naan was_good_but was_a_little under cooked_and doughy
the_chicken biriani was_my wife's favorite
i_liked_it quite_a_bit
but_it_was_a tad too minty for_me
my_favorite_was_the lamb_curry
i_thought the_flavors_were really_well balanced
the_paneer malai was_our least favorite
though we_still liked_it quite_a_bit
it was_a_tad sweet for_me
they_also gave us regular_naan which_was_good and buttery
about_half way through our_dinner
the_waitress began_to sing
she_had a_really_nice voice
because_of her accent
some_of_the words were a_little_off on pronunciation or cadence
but_overall i_enjoyed her singing
my_one complaint_was that_she had_the volume up pretty high
which_made it_very hard_to talk while she_was singing
she only sang a_few songs though
so it_wasn't_too disruptive
overall
we_enjoyed our_meal quite_a_bit
next_time we're going to_try_the_lunch_buffet which one_of_the waiters recommended
as do a_bunch_of yelpers
namaste's pretty close_to_my office so_if it's_good
i_may become a_regular
don't_let_the sketchy exterior of_this_place fool_you
it's actually a pretty_nice and_clean restaurant
the_owner who also is the_main entertainer is_really_nice and has_a_great singing voice
there_was_also_a belly_dancer who kept things lively and entertaining as_well
food_was reasonably_priced_and very_good
everyone in_our people group enjoyed_their food very_much
three of_us shared the_lamb_vindaloo_and the_tandori grill plate
that_was freaking delicious
very_good seasoning and_flavor on the_chicken
lamb and_shrimp
my_only_complaint_is about the_naan
it_was_a_bit too toasted and_not soft like what i'm_used_to
but_no biggie
it_was_still very_good
overall this_place_was a hit
the_main reason i_can't give_it stars_is mainly due_to_the service
although_the waiters_were friendly
they_seemed a_bit confused and the_food_took a_long_time to_come_out
which i'm_sure was due_to our large_party
other_than_that i would_definitely_recommend_this_place
vegas is_a mecca for many great_food genres
unfortunately indian is_not one_of_them
luckily
in_this wasteland there_is namaste
this_is_my_favorite indian_buffet_in_town
they keep the_line fresh and_clean and_there_are tons_of options
i_remember reading an article in_the lv weekly claiming they_have_the best_chicken in_town
now_that may be_a_bit of_an overstatement
but_their tandori_chicken is_pretty delicious
when_i'm in_the_area
it's_hard for_me not_to end_up at komol
but_i'm sometimes able to fight the urge and end_up at_namaste
i could_do without_the karaoke while_i eat
but_it_is pretty entertaining
ie humorous
lunch_or_dinner
it's all_good
this_is_one_of_my favorite_restaurants in_las_vegas_and a_must if you appreciate good_indian_food
the_lunch_buffet_is excellent
always some different_items and_a_great variety
butter_chicken
if you_know me
i_should be_able_to write those two words and_be done_with this_review
for_everyone else
well i_guess i'll keep going
with_all_the great_reviews about namaste's lunch_buffet
i've been meaning to_try_it for quite some_time
i_finally had_the excuse last weekend with one_of_my meetup groups
situated in commercial center
it's_not_the nicest neighborhood
but being right_next_to lotus of siam
they_have certainly associated themselves with_a good neighbor
the_interior_is well_decorated with quite_a_bit of wood trim
the_buffet area isn't huge
but provides a_good_selection
for_me though
it's all_about_the butter_chicken
all_i need is butter_chicken_and naan for_dipping and i'm_a happy camper
it's_just so freakin' delicious
i_should mention a_little tidbit
we_were_all enjoying our_meals and conversation when_we suddenly heard one_of_the_owners get up_to sing karaoke
she_didn't pick easy songs either
she sang celine's my_heart will_go on_and whitney's saving all_my love
she_was actually pretty_good
it_was_just unexpected
random karaoke aside
ayce definitely makes_me a_fan_of this_place
the_service_is_friendly and the_food_is_very_good
i_just_wish it_wasn't so_far from my_house
okay so_we_went while at ces and_they_were pretty busy that_night however it_took mins for_them to_come_back to my_table to_see_if i_needed anything and_i actually needed water
we_also asked_for_a goat dish and_they made_it with_lamb instead
the_food_was_pretty_good however not_as refined as_my fave amber india in_the_bay_area
the_owner sang
however_i wish she were singing indian_music because_i really dont care_for mrs dion
i_might try_it_again because i_think service_was off due_to ces
but_i reserve a star_because i_am_not completely sold
yelpers seem to_be_very disappointed_with origins but_they_are next on my_list
any_other_indian recommendations
so_far i_think mantra might be_my fave
stellar
the_food_is authentically awesome
melke
the_new owner_is the sweetest little thing
she even sing you some some songs as_you dine
i_recently landed back in_vegas_and had zero groceries in_the fridge
we_decided based upon proximity to pop into namaste for a_regular ol' meal
boy was_i surprised with_the warm reception
great entertainment and fantastic chow
i_actually felt_like_i went_on_a little vacation it_was such_a_great escape
victor and the_rest_of_the crew are real kind_and fun as_well
thanks guys for making that_and numerous times_since then a_wonderful experience
stopped_in namaste for_an extended lunch the_other day with a_date
after striking up_a convresation
melque the
new
owner serenaded us_for a_full set
what a_treat
she checked_on us frequently and talked with_us quite_a_bit about her home of goa
india
food_is lighter and fresher than some_other spots in_town
consistently good_and the_buffet_is frequently replenished
great_value considering the_price
what i_love most about_this_place
besides the ultra convenient central location
is_the dark
sultry wood decor
i treasure the places_in_vegas that don't_feel like vegas
and namaste fits the_bill
the energy in_the_place is_authentic
and_i came out feeling strangely rejuvenated and refreshed
i_thought_it_was just lunch
fantastic_food
after_reading_the reviews i_thought i_would_give this_restaurant a_try
what a_gem
this has_to_be one_of_the_best_indian food dining experiences i've_had
all dishes ordered were_delicious
we missed the_lunch buffe where we_could_have tasted more dishes_but we_did experience different entrees
service_was attentive_and_friendly
melque
the_owner_and entertainer
she has a_lovely voice
made_our dinner quite memorable
we will_go_back
small local restaurant
but cheap price
good_food
and lovely owner sing a song for_you
this_was really a_treat
the_owner is_warm_and willing to discuss the_menu in detail
she planned a_meal for_me_and my_wife that_was really_delicious some_of_the best lower priced indian i've_had
wonderful veggie curry_and_a brihani my_wife couldn't get_enough of
highly_recommended
i_went_with_a friend on_a_thursday night and_it_was dead
the_service_was prompt_and the_food_was_great
i_recommend_the somosas
tandoori sampler and_garlic_naan
the_food_was_pretty_good
the_lady owner was_really_nice
she_also sang karaoke while we_were_eating
price_is great
namaste's food
whether buffet or_dinner plates
is_consistently some_of_the_best_indian food_i've_ever_had
this was_our_first venture dining away from_the_strip it_was_a huge success
truly this_was_one_of_the_best indian_food experiences of my_life
second only_to restaurants_in singapore
fresh
complex
delicious ingredients prepared_with care
the breads were outstanding
the_vegetarian_dishes were superb
and the_whole meal_was cheap
win
awesome_place
we_stopped_in last_night_and after deciding to_try_something_new
this_place hit_the_spot and_they_were also having an
open mic
night
which_was kinda weird in_a cool sort of way
the_owner melque was_really_nice and_she recommended some_dishes for_us
our_waiter rob was_really_great and personable
toward the_end_of our_meal
melque got_up and sang a song
overall this_place_was great
the_lunch_buffet_is great
the dinner_is pricey and_the_portions_are a_little_too small
the_lunch_buffet never leaves me unsatisfied and_never breaks my wallet
great_food
i_finally found an indian_restaurant_in_vegas after years of_being here
it was_kind_of funny actually i_got_a groupon for_this_restaurant and_finally was_able_to use_it
it_was saturday_night and when_i_walked in_this little_indian woman was singing
i will_always love you
i_didn't expect that but_she has_a_great voice
then as_soon as_she was finished with_the song she said_that a_belly_dancer would_be out shortly
it was_kind_of funny this whole night of entertainment when_i had_only expected to_find_a mediocre restaurant_with mediocre food
my_friend_ordered this awesome soup spinach_and chicken i_think
yummy
our_main dishes_were lamb_vindaloo_and chicken_tika_masala
they_were both so_delicious
the_nan was_fresh_and fluffy
the_owner
the singer
came_by to_see_how we were_doing
and because_i_was so impressed_with_the food i_wanted_to hug her
we_got_to talking and_she was_really_nice that_she made_me decide on_the spot that not_only would it be one_of_my_favorite restaurants
but_all my_friends favorite too
can't_wait_to go_back
pretty_good food
friendly_staff
food_here_is great
whether it be the_lunch_buffet or dinner_menu
not_too fond of_the_evening singer they_have at_the_restaurant
but food_is_great
hands down
this_is absolutely the_best_indian_food_i_have ever_had anywhere
i_would_highly_recommend anyone that reads this_review to_go_here and_eat
order the_paneer shashlik as your appitizer
you_will_not_be_disappointed
yep
i_have visited namaste twice within the_last six months
both_times for_dinner
outside_of it being_in commercial center
a relatively seedy side_of vegas
this_restaurant rocks
the interior_of the_location_is very dark and ominous and_absolutely perfect_for a romantic evening
we_were_greeted by the_owner who_was an energetic as possible
our_drink orders_were placed and delivered within a_short amount of_time and_then the_waiter assisted us_with our dining options
we_decided upon a_lamb josh
garlic_naan and_the_butter_chicken
i_have_had butter_chicken before
but none as succulent as_this
this_was very fragrant
juicy and_just downright delicious
it has_to_be some_of_the best butter_chicken i_have_ever_had
hands down
the_lamb_was also very_tasty and_was_not heavy at_all
the_naan was_also_very_good
very few restaurants make you_want_to_try everything on_their_menu at least once
this_is that_place
the_food_is addictive and_when coupled with the_ambiance of the_location
it_just made_it a downright special place_to_go
i_would_highly_recommend this plae to family_and friends
we_were visiting_vegas from out_of_town for the_weekend and yelp_reviews point us_to namaste
this_place_is_great
the_food
service_and owner singer are absolutely fabulous
the_owner_and staff_are happy_to recommend items_on_the_menu for_those that aren't so familiar_with_indian_food
all recommendations were_delicious
every_time_we are in_town
we_will dine at_namaste
first indian_place i_have_been_to in_las_vegas_and i_was_excited
i_had read_the_reviews on_yelp_and was anxious to_try_the place_out
you_walk_in and immediately you_are succumb to_a dark
woody
quiet environment
it_is calm
soothing and_relaxing
the booths were_nice and big_and very comfy
i deducted a star_because as_an american
i_should always_have the_option to american drinks
no tea
no lemonade
no soda
water or lassi seemed_to be our only option and i_was_disappointed in_that
the_food_was_good
not_great
i_have_had definately had_better_indian_food
i_was extremely happy that_they_had butter_chicken but in_my_opinion it_should have_been a_little_more creamier
the_tandori_chicken didn't seem authentic either
so that_was big a no for_me
the_naan
wasn't_the freshest or softest i_have_had either
maybe it_was the_day_we went but_i_felt they should_have had_more variety for chutneys
the_buffet itself_was a_bit_pricey for_the_amount_of different choices they_offered
i_did like_most of_what_i had
very_filling
ate one_and half plates
no indian_people eating_there either
that_should have_been my number one sign
i_would_go_back maybe
really wonderful place_and amazing_food
the_owner_is so authentic
and_you cant help to_feel the care and_love she puts in_the_dishes and_each customer is_so important to_her
the_restaurant_is very_clean_and cozy too
so_nice to_be in_a tranquil enviroment in_las_vegas
even_though_it is in_that crazy strip_mall
you_are transported and_only are reminded as_you head to_your car
try_the samoas
tikka_marsala
chicken soup
and dont miss the_garlic nann
no doubt we_will_be_back
big thanks_to groupon
to_help to_have us check_it_out
it_is_a homerun
om namah shivaya
namaste owner melque rodrigues is_the hardest working woman in the_las_vegas restaurant business
she greets customers
seats them
serves them
sings for_them
you gotta hear her whitney houston and ella fitzgerald
then rings up their
affordable
check
she
alone
is reason enough_to visit the indian_restaurant
but_there_are many others
including_a relaxing atmosphere
booths
mood lighting
dark wood floors and walls
convenient location
in historic commercial center
just east of_the_strip
and delicious_food
start_with the lamb_chops and move on_to the_aloo_gobi
skip the overpriced
overrated and impersonal restaurants on_the_strip and in_the 'burbs and visit_this independent up_and comer
food was_mediocre
we_were forced to listen to karaoke and_it_took forever to_get_our change
on_the upside
the_lady was super_nice
p
s
do_not order the_lamb sagwaala unless_you like salsa
sadly
i_have_to withdraw my previously positive review and add my_recent unpleasant experience
previously
i_had only visited for_the_lunch_buffet
which_is good and_reasonably_priced
dinner_is a_different story
i purchased a_groupon because_i have_always enjoyed this_place
except
of_course
the owner's occasional need_to karaoke
can someone tell her that_she is_too loud and_not whitney houston
we attempted to_go_there two weeks_ago
but_the roof had_a flood
we spoke with the_owner for a_few_minutes
we_walked_in at_pm_and there_was still_a three foot by four foot puddle on_the_floor
she rents the_space
but why_not clean it_up
so
we returned there last_night to try_again
the_food_was_good
not_great and_the_rice_was sparse
so
when_we_asked for_our left_overs to_go
we asked_if_we could_get a_little_more rice to_take_home with_us
there_was_an additional charge on the_bill for_rice
this_was_the big_deal
she wrote in_an tip on_the overall bill
now
i_would_have completely understood if she wrote a_quick note on_the side with_the calculations for
and tip on_the total bill
but to_write in_the tip on_a table_for two just because_we_were using a_groupon is uncalled for
my_friend
who_was paying the_difference
was_so mad
so crossed it_off and_gave her a tip
lastly
when the_owner_is serving me
i_feel less bad about_the tip considering_that is_not how she makes her wages
unlike normal wait_staff
the_bf and_i_have_been watching a_lot about_indian_food lately so we're on_a kick for_some
i've_had this bookmarked for_a_long_time and_wanted_to see_what the fuss is_about
when_we_walked_in
the_owner_was belting out_some tunes so_we just waited_for her to_finish to_get_our drinks in
i'm filipino so i've been disenfranchised and subjected to a_lot_of karaoke
some_people might like_the entertainment
but fair warning that if_you're_not keen on_it
you_might catch one song but_not a_whole performance
we_did the_buffet_for
i_also_ordered a_mango_lassi
good_but standard
the spread was_decent
with chicken_dishes
or_so veggie_dishes
salad
chutneys raita
naan
rice
spongy little cakes
dont know the_name
potato pakora
rice_pudding_and oranges for sweets
we_both thought_it_was decent
but this_is_not our_favorite lunch_buffet
the standout for me_was_the saag which had_a_nice gingery flavor_and creamy texture_and the refreshing rice_pudding
i_wish_the naan wasn't premade and was_fresh made as_some of_them were_really crunchy for sitting_out
the_flavors_were good
but_i_don't like_that some_of_the items_were precut bagged vegetable mix and_they_were doing their supply order while_we_were there and_it confirmed what_was frozen and_what was_not
i_know times aren't the_best for businesses
but fresh vegetables is_one_of_the reasons why i'm drawn to_indian_food
i_would_say it_was_a
star buffet
i'll round up as the_service_was_very warm
friendly_and_attentive and the_atmosphere_is_nice
i just_don't think i_will_be_coming that often when we_both have_a love for_a_place we_know uses better quality_ingredients and_we built a repoire with already
love_this_place
melque is_absolutely adorable and_makes every visit that more special with_her warmth
the_food_is to_die_for
hands down best indian_cuisine i've_had
a_group_of us went_here before going_to a show
the_food_was average
but the_best_part_of the_evening was_when the_waitress put down her tray and started singing a karaoke version_of
i will_always love you
the key change was hilarious and_she belted it like she_was celine or_something
best part_was
it_is next_to lotus of suam which_is far better in_quality
star_for good curries
star_for ambiance
star_for clean rest room
i have_taken stars off for
hard basmati_rice
and_the_service
also heard the_waiter and_the_owner quarreling over some leaves that the_waiter wanted_to take but_was denied
food_is_amazing
went_with another and_ordered the namaste special meat option_for
and_it_was more then enough_for the both_of_us
the_waitress owner was_more then kind
and_even sang for_us
quite the multi tasker
the flavoring was exceptional
and the_lassi was_good_and thick
stars
this is_going_to_be short and_sweet
the_food_was_amazing and_the_owner lovely_and genuine
not bad_food
the karaoke though was_a_bit much_and ruins any conversation you_may be trying_to have w a_friend
the_lady singing looks like_an_indian halle berry
swear
oh_yeah
the_area of_town its in
don't reccomend it late at_night
kinda weird crowd in the_parking_lot
before making_a visit_to namaste
i_have never_tried_indian and had_no particular interest in_it
since_i_was on vacation i_thought_that i_could give_it_a try and_i was_not_disappointed
i_would just_like to_say_that this_food_is really hit_or_miss because to_an average person a_lot_of_the food generally tastes the_same with_the addition subtraction of meats_and veggies
the_food did look a_bit unappetizing but_once_you get started
you will_find yourself in_a bloated bliss
did_not_have the runs
this_place_is in_a horrible neighbor hood
so_if_you choose to_go_here
then do get a_cab or car
we walked there and_felt very insecure
place_is dark and dingy
i didnt have_the courage to_try_the restrooms
horrible food
pathetic ambience
we went_there_for a_sunday buffett
they_were clearly not prepared
their_food containers were half_full
may be it_was left_over food_from saturday
in_fact
when one_of_the vegetables was_over
i_asked them to_get more
they_put water in_it and_got it_back
bread service_was slow_and poor
save your money
don't_go here
try something more popular on_the_strip
just had_the_lamb josh and_lamb_vindaloo
both_were amazing
the_highlight_of the_night was_the panner shashlik
simply amazing
a_great night
we will_certainly be_back
its_a mission to_find an_indian_restaurant_that has good_food
good_service
and good_value at dinner_time
indian_food_is generally enjoyed at_their self serve lunch_buffets
but_i_had a_craving_for some curry_at pm
i_have_to_say i_have_never received such poor_service in_my_life
the_waiter wasn't rude 'per se' but his way_of speaking was_very condescending
every question or comment we_had he rolled his eyes or had something very short to_say
cleanliness no
the_person i_was dining_with dropped their napkin on_the_floor on_their way_to the_bathroom
an_indian woman who appeared_to be either the_owner or the_manager proceeded_to pick_it up
off the_floor
and place it on_top_of our_table
where_we will eat
i_was absolutely disgusted and demanded another napkin
the_lamb we_ordered_was such poor quality
it_was_very gamy and was_overcooked and_dry
we_ordered plain and_garlic_naan
the_garlic_naan had good_flavor but_they_were both overcooked_and almost crispy
i_can't_remember what our nd entree was but_it obviously wasn't worth remembering
good ratings mean nothing to_me if the_food_quality
and especially cleanliness
isn't there
eat somewhere_else
decent place
i_really_liked there garlic_naan
also
there butter_chicken had great_flavor
those were_the choices i_got from the_yelp_reviews
wanted to_try_the sashlik but_it_was made out_of cottage_cheese so_maybe i'll_try next_time when_i'm in_the_mood
got the_meat appetizer also
it_was_ok
i'd probably be_back_for the_naan and_the_butter_chicken
this_is_a very unique indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
the_ambiance_is very_pleasant and_relaxing
we_were_greeted with_a very_warm welcome and introduced to_some_of their specials
we_ordered_the lamb_vindaloo
butter_chicken
garlic_naan_and vegetables biriani
it_was_all very_delicious and_nicely presented
melque's singing was_a plus to_the dining_experience
she sang from her heart and_has_a soulful voice
the_lunch_buffet here is_also_very reasonably_priced_and offers a_wide_selection
this_is_definitely one_of_my_favorite_indian restaurants
first_off the_owner has an_amazing voice
and_if_you talk_to her enough you_can get her_to sing you_a song
the_buffet has_a nice_selection of_both vegetarian_and non_vegetarian foods
they lose a_star in_some of_the_food being over seasoned
i_do deduct a star_for not_having the_best_naan which i_think_is essential to indian_cuisine
still it_was_an enjoyable experience there_and_the service_is_great
i_would honestly give_this
stars
we've only had_the_lunch_buffet and_their fresh nan_bread is_amazing
the_butter_chicken_was very_flavorful_and rich
saag_paneer had firm paneer chunks and_chicken tandori was juicy
they_had_a decent amount of selection and_the_food_was warm hot
the_lady that_was serving us was_nice_and friendly
my_only problem with_this_place is_that_they put a_lot_of cream into the_buffet
a trick used get customers full faster
and_you_can feel that when_you're done eating
their masala_chai was very_bland as_well_and just tasted like plain tea
in_all until_i try_their dinner_menu i'm not_overly impressed with_this_place but i_have_to_say their nan_bread is_one_of_the_best ever and_we will_go_back just for_that
i_have_only been here_for_lunch
they_have_a_great lunch_buffet
naan is_fresh_and tandori_chicken is_tasty
service_was above_average and_attentive
the_price_is reasonable and_i'll return again for_lunch
considering_the casual ambiance
i_don't_think_i would consider this_place_for_a night_out of_indian_food
by all means
check_out_the lunch_buffet for_a_quick
tasty_indian meal
we_went_to namaste and_took a_friend_who was visiting_vegas
he had_been several_times to_india
we are_big fans of_indian_food and_we_all loved_this_place
we_ordered off_the_menu
even_though_it was lunch_time
buffet available
and had_just a_lovely meal
i had_the_lamb_vindaloo
which_was amazing
some of_the_best_i've_had
but_not like_any i've_had before
this_one had_a_very unique flavor
more tomato taste_and quite lovely
chicken_tiki_masala was_also incredible
but_i_think_the best_thing was the_house specialty shrimp
the_naan_was_good and_soft and_hot
melque
the_owner
even treated us_to two songs
i_will dine at_namaste again
a_lot
loved_it
go for_the_lunch_buffet
stay for_the great_service
the spread was pretty_decent
with_a_couple chicken_dishes and_lots_of vegetarian_options
the_tandoor chicken_was juicy
surprising for_a_buffet
but my_favorite was_probably_the cabbage
i_also enjoyed_the chutneys_and the_dessert
pass on_the plain mango lahsee
the_butter_chicken_was ok
but_i_like a_really creamy chicken_with legs and thighs not chicken_breast
i'm convinced white people want white_meat and complain so_that's why it's made_with breast
but_what do_i know anyway
this_is so_far the_tastiest indian_food_i_have_had in_las_vegas
i'm_not sure_if dinner will_ever happen because for now
the_lunch_buffet_is a_great_price to_try a_few_different dishes
great_place for_a_quick
easy lunch_for great and_tasty indian_food
from_one end_of_the buffet to_the_other
the lunch_menu offered great tasting_food
great_food always starts with fresh_ingredients
and_the freshness in nasmaste's food really shines through
the_owner_was super pleasant and_really a_pleasure to_speak with
i would_definitely_recommend_this_place to_anyone_looking_for delicious_food
indian or otherwise
i'm actually not_a_fan
but_i loved_the_food
the_restaurant_has_a nice clean look that_is soft_and comfortable
the_service_was_great too
this_review_is_for their_lunch_buffet
i_came_in around_pm after_a day at_the korean spa
they_are_open from
pm
pm for_lunch_and then reopen at pm for_dinner
yet again i_almost missed out_on_a solid place because_i was_going_to walk out
first glances can_be deceptive
especially when_you_walk into an_empty restaurant in_the_middle_of lunch hours
i_decided_to stay anyways due to_all_the high reviews of_this_place
i_cannot say_that yelp has lead me astray
the_lunch_buffet_is smaller than_other restaurants_and does not offer saag
i_was_disappointed to_see_that their paneer_is without_the homemade cheese cubes
i did_enjoy their butter_chicken_and aloo_gobi though
in the_beginning
i_was counting all of_my_favorite items_that was_missing
but_after a_few bites i_was enjoying what they_did offer
unlike other_places
the_items in_the warmers were kept piping_hot
nothing_was lukewarm
the_fried potatoes retained a crispiness that_is normally unheard of in buffets
overall_i was_impressed_with how attentive the_owner_was
she cleared plates
refilled my_water
and checked up_on me frequently
i overheard her conversation about the_restaurant having_a tough time
but_she doesn't let it show in the_quality_of_the_food
i_hope their business picks up
because_it_is a_solid option_for those not_too familiar_with_indian or someone who loves butter_chicken
which i_don't_see too often on the_line
this_review_is_for dinner service and_not_the lunch_buffet
we dined here saturday_night and_overall experience_was enjoyable
the_restaurant_was fairly empty
two other_tables occupying the_space
which_was slightly worrisome
our_server_was also the_owner_and she_was pleasant and_sweet
we_started off_with_a bottle_of cabernet and_two appetizers
chicken pakoras and vegetable_samosas
i_was_not particularly impressed_with either
but out_of_the in our_party enjoyed both
our_entrees were following
butter_chicken
very_good
saag_paneer
nothing_special
goan shrimp_curry
my_favorite out_of our choices
exceptionally good
lamb_tikka_masala
also_good
chicken_vindaloo
did_not try
but rest_of_the party enjoyed
we_also_had four orders_of garlic_naan which seemed_a_little too crispy for_my_liking
although_not perfect
the_food_and_service here_are well above par
i_will_definitely_be returning to_sample more_of their_menu and_of_course indulge in more goan shrimp_curry
went_in here_for_dinner with_a_friend and was_pleasantly_surprised
i_tried_the buffet_in order_to maximize my_dinner with different options
everything tasted_great
the_butter_chicken_and the_chicken_curry were_both my_favorite
the_owner_was very_pleasant and_helpful in explaining things to_me
with it_being my_first_time eating_indian_food
it_was_definitely a_good dining_experience and with_the_food being so_delicious i_will_definitely_go back
it made_me a_little sad to_eat_here because_i really_had to go_out_of my_way and into_a shady area to_experience some lame food
at least the_service_was_good and_the_owner is_pretty funny and charismatic
so
the_food
i_was_here specifically for_the_lunch_buffet
i'm_sure if_it_was bustling full_of people it wouldn't_be as lame
it_was clearly just sitting there
it_had_a film over the_top
usually most_places at least stir the_food around_to avoid_this effect
so
the stale food was_just_ok
nothing_special
i'm_sure it_would_be a_little better fresh
and a_lot better with more_than a_handful_of items to_pick from
i_can't_speak for made_to_order items during_dinner
but_definitely avoid_this place_for_lunch
it_just isn't worth_it
one_of_the_best_indian_restaurants we've eaten_at in_the vegas_area
we_went_here for_our anniversary
and the_food_was_good_and the_atmosphere_was fun
we_went_there on_a sep long weekend
the_interior_is ok
but the_food_is_amazing
we_had_a chat_with the_owner she was_really_nice
she_is an_amazing singer
she even dedicated a song for_us
we_were_there_for nights so night before this we had_dinner in gandhi's which_is good_to but_this_is better
and the_customer_service is_amazing
will_definitely recommend_it
ahhn and_if_you plan_to go try the_malai dish it_is delicious
little expensive though
of_us ate_here and thoroughly_enjoyed melque's advice on what_to_order
the_food_was_amazing
what we_weren't expecting was_also her entertainment
she sang so richly while we_ate
what a_treat
i_highly_recommend eating_here
delicious
we will_return
i stand by_my belief that i_hate buffets
but
if you_make a_buffet that_is compact
meaning small_and only consisting of_delicious dishes
steps from_where i_am sitting and slap a
price tag on_it
then_you and_i_can dance
namaste's lunch_buffet_is all those things
this_is_a small_restaurant
so_no matter where_you are sitting
you_are close_to_the action
the_naan_bread is_fresh out_of_the oven and worth_the brief wait so_it comes_out piping_hot_and delicious
my_favorite
as is_true of most_indian_restaurants
was the_butter_chicken
the_only con is_that there_were_no samosas on_the bar but
frankly
much like sushi
samosas_are never good on_a buffet anyway
the_little lady who_is running this_place_is maybe_the cutest little thing ever
i_wanted_to put her in_my pocket and_take her home with_me
which_is made even weirder by the_fact_that i_am maybe an inch taller than her haha
so_nice_and genuine and_you_can really tell she takes pride in her place
she told my_friend_and_i that_she sings nightly
wish the_neighborhood were close_to_my home so_i_could stop_in here_for_dinner sometime and check_it_out
but_no doubt
i'll be hitting up this lunch_buffet again soon
i'd been_to namaste several_times for_dinner_and once for_lunch in_the_past
but it_had_been far too_long of_a lapse from going
decided_to_go for_lunch today since i'm_still embarked on
las_vegas indian_lunch_buffet tour
and inexplicably had_not tried_it in long enough_to warrant a_review
i_was actually very_impressed_with the times i_went_to namaste for_dinner
one of_those occasions would_have warranted a and_the_other a
so_i should be ashamed of myself for_not posting a_review then and instead hitting them with_a for today's lunch_buffet
but_that's exactly what i'm_going_to do
let me start_off by saying service_was fantastic
and_the gentleman who seated_us was_very_friendly_and made_sure my iced_tea stayed flowing
iced_tea was_delicious by the_way
it_was_one_of those fruit flavored kinds which i'm_not certain of
but very_tasty nonetheless
and that_there_was always a_plate_of hot_naan at_the_table
the_first portion we_received of naan_was_excellent
soft
fresh and_with_a great_flavor
the nd plate was_a_little overcooked_and therefore too crispy for_my_liking
but_overall the_naan_was fine
as_for_the selections on the_actual buffet
i was_a_tad disappointed
a minor gripe is layout wise the_rice_was at_the_end_of_the line
i_think_it works much better at_the_front so_i_can keep piling all_the various curries_and dals over_the rice
instead_of vice versa which_is_what i_ended_up doing
as_for_the food_itself
i_was a_big_fan_of the_saag
hooray for_it not_being saag_paneer like_i normally find_at buffets as i_can't handle the_cheese
i_also thought the_potato pakora was_delicious_and unique to_any pakora offerings i've_had elsewhere
the chicken_curry_was a_fine version
and_the piece_of chicken_i ended_up_with were very_tender and_flavorful
the_rest_of it_was fairly average to_me
it_could just_be a preference thing
but_i_found most_of_the other offerings to_be_very thin in consistency
almost soup like
while_i guess i_tend_to prefer a thicker dal or curry_with my rice
when i'd try_to scoop a spoonful of_most of_these onto my_plate
they immediately would_go all_over_the entire plate_and mix into everything else
if you've read my other_reviews you_know i generally like_this when_i eat_indian_food
but the_point is i_like_to do_it myself
to_be_the master of my_own domain so to_speak
generally i_also just found_the offerings limited compared_to my_favorite lunch_buffets mt_everest and_mint
i'm a_samosa fiend so not_having those effects me
and namaste makes a_fine version from_what i've_had at_dinner
i_would_have also_liked to_see more meat offerings
they_had chicken_dishes
but were prepared in butter or yogurt so they_were off limits to_my sensitive
annoying tummy
it's_quite possible i caught them_on a_day with_a selection that just_didn't suit my needs
but even_if that's the_case the_fact_that i've never caught everest or mint in_that situation speaks volumes to_me
myself_and wife_had visited vegas_for
yes pure fun and stumbled on namaste indian_cuisine
it_was_the_best food_we had_in_vegas
the_owner melque was_so kind and_attentive and_always going out_of way to_make us_feel comfortable
the_food_was of_course amazing_and me being vegan i_was just amazed at_the choices
so_we_decided_to go_back again before we_left vegas_for buffet and_the_food again was_just excellent
everything was_fresh_and service always the_best
to_top off_the wonderful_food melque
the_owner a professional singer
also sang some beautiful notes for_us and made_our lunch_special
so what can you_ask more good_food good music and_good ambiance
we_will surely be_back when we_are_in vegas we miss you melque
and_of_course the wonderful_food please open one_in denver co and we_will_be your loyal customers
keep up_the great_service_and food
sairam hiremagalur and sinduja raghavan

i_was in_las_vegas_for a_trip in_the month of august with my_friends
the_lunch_buffet_was about to_close in_minutes when_we_walked_in and i_felt we_were late for_the_lunch
the_ambiance was_ok and_staff paid attention when_we_walked inside
the_owner of_the_restaurant was_also working along_with restaurant staff
they_have very_limited number_of items for_the_lunch_buffet
the_food_in the containers was_about to_finish and we_asked the_waitress to_get_the food
i_liked_the curry_with boiled eggs and it_was_perfect combination with naan's
the_food_is_not so_spicy and_the_price of_the_buffet was_ok
i_guess we shouldn't expect spicy indian_food_in a city like las_vegas
disappointing indian_buffet
don't_let_the neighborhood fool_you inside is_warm_and pleasant
the_food_is exceptional and_if the_owner makes a suggestion
take_it you'll love_it
super horrible indian_restaurant to_visit in_vegas
the_food_is too pricy
the_lady over there_was too harsh and_service_was pathetic
i_would_never recommend_this_place
i wished to_give_them a zero but_there_is no option
i_was visiting a_friend
and_he and_his son took_me for_some indian_cuisine
as_it turns out it_was_the right place_to_go
while not_being new to_the_indian flavor of_food
namaste did offer some new twist on_an otherwise stable menu
as_always i_tend_to heed the suggestions for_the own help
and not_being afraid_to try_new_things seem_to always payoff
in_my_opinion
this_is_one_of_the better_places for_indian_food
try_it and_enjoy
l
we_went_here for_lunch on_our trip_to_vegas and really_enjoyed_the_food and_found it_to_be authentic_and tasty
the_host was_friendly_and it_seemed_like a_nice family_owned business
the naan_was_great
butter_chicken_and saag was_good
rice was_a_bit hard as_it_was left steaming for_a_long_time and the_kheer could_have been much better
all in_all a_very_nice meal
good_food_and nice service
the_owner serves excellent_food and_then will sing to resteraunt patrons
if_you_are lucky
give_it_a go and_you'll enjoy your indaian food escapade
i've_been_here once before_and thought_it_was fantastic
this_time we_walked_in and_they pretty much told_us we_had to_get_the buffet
which_i didn't_even know was_an option_for dinner
we_told her we had_a_groupon and_she said they'd still take_it
i_think_we appeared disappointed
so she encouraged us to_check_out_the buffet and_gave us time_to decide
the_buffet_had limited items but_we_were probably going_to_get chicken_tikka_masala or curry anyway and_both_were on_the_buffet
our groupon was set to expire in a_week so_we figured we better just use_it
i_think_the owner sensed our hesitation and_finally offered_us the_whole menu but_she said it'd be_a long_wait for_food nice they_were getting busy
only_the booths were occupied so it_didn't seem busy_but we_decided_to stick with_the_buffet option
we_were pretty hungry
she_also moved us_to a_different booth
both_of which seemed dirty
very confusing
we_were given_a fresh basket_of naan_and our_drinks
and_on to_the_buffet
i_think_the chicken_curry_was the_best_thing on_the_buffet but was_pretty picked through and there_wasn't much left
tikka_masala was_kind_of bland
i_make better at_home
the_tandoori_chicken was_good_but we kept getting little broken bits_of bone in_the meat around the_whole bone
i didn't_really like_their dal either
the_entire time_we_were_there workers kept walking back_and forth with big sheets to set tables
aren't they closed after lunch to_do this
we_got_there about so_there couldn't have_been that many_people in_and_out that quickly
the_waitress owner was_very_nice_and apologetic throughout but the_entire experience_was strange
with_all_the good indian_options in_town
i_doubt i'll go_back
the_lunch_buffet_is good
however
there_are much better indian_buffets_in town
i_went the the_restaurant for_dinner using a_groupon
i_ordered_the shrimp_curry house special and_was_very disappointed
the_curry_was ok
but the_curry only contained small shrimp and cost nearly
the_restaurant_is simply not_worth it_for mediocre food
and_it shows based_on_the empty dinning room
if_your in_the_area_and not able_to_get into lotus
please try another restaurant_in_the complex
there_are much better options than namaste
i_like_the lunch_buffet
the_owner_is_a nice genuine person_who interacts with guest
wow
for an_awesome lunch buffett
ask the_hostess nicely and_she will sing frank sinatra or whitney songs
try_this_place and_you wont be_disappointed
so sad
rolled up_to a_sign today that_said closed indefinitely
i've_only ever ordered a_takeaway from_here
i've never actually eaten_in their restaurant_itself
but_this_is without_a shadow of_a doubt my_favourite indian_takeaway spot in_edinburgh
for_starters
the_food_is_great value their set meal_for people includes chicken_and vegetable_pakoras
any lamb or_chicken curries_and any naan_and or rice_for
but_you wouldn't think_it_was that cheap to_taste it
what's more
even on_weekends the delivery is_always quick
i've never waited more_than half an_hour
and it's_always piping_hot when_it arrives
for_me there's nothing worse than realising you're starving
ordering a_takeaway
only to_spend the_next hour hour_and a_half pacing in_front_of_the window wondering where the_hell it_is
you'll need_to order_from here_at_least half a_dozen times before you_can even begin to decide which_is your favourite dish
mainly due_to_the huge variety on_the_menu
i'd highly_recommend_the chicken chasni which_is tandoori grilled
then cooked_with ground nuts
chillies
green peppers
garlic_and cream
it_definitely hits_the spot
it's_not often i_get takeaways
i'm_really lazy and takeaways tend_to guilt trip me into having to_go_to_the gym the_next_day
but_if you're_going_to get_one then get_it from_here
from the_outside
manna mahal doesnt look anything special just_a simple_and standard indian_restaurant
nor does it look anything special on_the_inside
traditional looking and_plain
however
how_the restraunt looks isnt why i_come_here time_and agin
it's the_food
always well flavoured and good_quality the_food_is simply outstanding its_the equvalent of_your mums home cooking
simple
delicious_and morish
further more
they_do it_as_a take away
and thats great_as_well
the_food_is also remarkably cheap
service_in manna mehal isnt anything to_write_home_about
but_it isnt awful either
so_there you_have it
great_food and_a_nice
if plain
setting to_eat_it in
as_others have_said
manna mahal doesn't look_like the snazziest joint in_the town
however don't judge_a book
or an_indian_restaurant
by_its cover
i_first tasted what manna mahal had to_offer when a_takeaway
i_was_pleasantly_surprised
i came_back again and_sat in
this_time i_was_a_little less impressed
the_food_wasn't quite what_i ordered and_overall it_didn't live up to_me previous experience
this could_have_been_a bad night because i_have_ordered takeaway again_and it_has_been fine
the_prices_are really_good
especially by edinburgh standards
and portions_are a_generous size
if_you_don't mind simple curry_and simply decor_and you_like good_indian_food
check_this_place out
i_wouldn't recommend_it for showing fancy dining
but_for straight forward takeaway lazy night_out
your on good ground
manna mahal is_only a ten miute walk_away from_where i_live in_edinburgh and_over the_past year i've_been_here at least three_times
the_atmosphere inside_is tranquil whilst the_service_is pleasant_and fast as anthing
however
the_food_has to_be_the highlight of_the_restaurant
obviously
as it_all tastes amazing_and is surpsisingly cheap
the startes are mostly and the_mains are_only around each
i_had_the mutton coconut starter followed by the_butter_chicken the_last_time_i was_in and_the_quality_of_the meat in_both was_outstanding
the sauce_which the_chicken_was in had_a_great range_of flavours_and was amazingly creamy
i_really_like this_place_and recommend_it without_a doubt
don't_be fooled
this food_court corner is run_by the_same fellas that do some major gourmet indian_cuisine in_vegas_and elsewhere
i_was floored great_food
definitely check out_their one_of a kind fried cauliflower dish
after_a grueling day_of shooting pool in_the southwest challenge
i_was pleased_to find_that the_food_court at_the_riviera had an_indian_restaurant
at_first
i_thought_i was hallucinating
but_once the_smell_of the shahi_paneer and_garlic_naan that i_ordered hit my nose
i realized that_this blissful little moment was_actually taking place
the_staff_was_friendly
excited even
over my obvious enthusiasm
i came_back the_next_day and_had_the malai_kofta
also_excellent
when_i return_for the national apa team championship in august
i_will_definitely_be at india_masala
a_couple_of_weeks ago my_husband and_i_went_to a festival celebrating indian culture and food_at_the county building
while there
we sampled food_from several indian_restaurants_around town
and_were most pleased with what_we_had at_the booth of india_masala
which_is permanently located in_the_riviera
for_the_first_time we_had dosa
a lentil and_rice pancake crepe that_is_a typical dish_of southern india
we happened to_pick_up a postcard offering off our_check so_we_decided_to head to the_riviera to see_what else_was being offered
it's no surprise that the_riviera is on_its last legs
and ranks up_there with circus circus as_being the_most rundown hotel on_the_strip
we certainly worked up an appetite as_we made_the looooong walk_from the_parking garage to the_food_court
next_time i'd valet in_the front_of_the casino
no
we_weren't expecting indian masala to_be_a semi fast_food restaurant
but as_it turns out
it_was
the_prices aren't really justified considering this
but_the_food_is really_good and_it_was packed_with more indians and convention attendees than any_other tenant's space when_we_were there
see below
so_we figured it_was safe to_stay
we_had_to_wait about in_line for five minutes and_then another ten_minutes or_so for_our_food
which was_a_bit frustrating
but_i_felt rewarded when_i_got my dosa
today i_opted_for one stuffed_with spinach
the_palak dosa
but_you_can also choose from_a filling of chickpeas
chole
potatoes
masala
or no filling at_all
plain
it_is served_with what_i learned to_be_the traditional accompaniments
sambar
a_vegetable soup
and coconut_chutney
imagine a thick_and textured almond milk
there_is_also a third side that i_can best describe as_a pureed and_spiced red bell pepper spread
the dosa_is flavorful enough on_its own
but the_sauces add another dimension and_were very_much enjoyed
the_dosa itself_is delicate
with_a browned
crisp exterior and_a soft
lightly chewy interior
you_can_get_a better idea_of the textural difference when_you_order it plain
but_the filling makes_it a_meal
i_must_say it's_a dish that's growing on_me
and_i'd bear the pain of walking through that casino to_enjoy another one_day
my_husband was_less thrilled with_his dish
but it_seems_to me_that the emphasis here_is on lesser known southern indian_cuisine so chicken_vindaloo
might not_have_been the_best option
this vindaloo_was flavorful_but not nearly hot enough_for ian who asked them to_make_it as spicy_as possible
the larger problem was_the color of the_sauce
which_was reminiscent_of an artificially colored sweet and_sour
the color should_have been deeper and darker had_it been a_result of the_spices
things_that don't look natural probably aren't
so we'll just_say this color most likely wasn't derived from_where it_should have_been
if_you_are interested in trying a_new kind of indian_dish that_isn't available at other_restaurants around_town
as far_as i_know
i_would_definitely_recommend coming_here_for the_dosa
i'd_be willing to_try a_few_other things but_i_think what i_had_was the_most reasonably_priced for_you what_you_get
and certainly the_most unique
for location_and atmosphere this_place_is star located_in_a bordering on skeezy food_court at_the_riviera
food_is_great however extremely decent
with some_of_the hugest and tastiest naan around
i_wouldn't go_here over most_of_the sit down places_in_town
simply because_i want some service_and don't_like food courts
but_if you're trapped at_the_riviera this_is infinitely better_than the_rest_of_the crap they_serve up
it sure was depressing to_see_how the vast majority_of people opted for lowest common denominator hamburgers and_hot dogs over wonderful indian_cuisine
thank_you sheila b
for piquing my interest
eric r
and_i did a_few hikes at valley of fire state park and headed back to_vegas around_pm starving
he_asked me if_i_had anything bookmarked on_the north strip
look_at him
pretending to_know everything about yelp
and_i said india_masala at_the_riviera
haha we laughed i_had never_been_to the_riviera ever
we parked and wandered through_the maze and_there it_was
in the_food_court
i_ordered_a masala_dosa and eric got the_tandoori combo
his came_with naan
cilantro chutney
tandoori_chicken on_the bone
chicken_tikka
chicken kabob
some_other chicken seasoned
and daal
lentils
mine came_with coconut and tomato chutneys and_spiced tomato_soup
the_meals were filling and_tasty
i_loved_the chutneys
especially_the cilantro
and it_did its justice with_my nose running
i_would return_for this
hidden_gem
why is this_place the best_indian_food_in_vegas
well
because_it_is the_only indian_food_i had_in_vegas
by default it wins
but_it wins in_other ways
its is fracking cheap
relatively speaking of_course
the_menu_is quite huge_and it puts the_other guys in the_food_court to shame
the_service_is pretty_good and_the_wait time is_decent considering_the queue of_customers and_staff on hand
the_food_itself is_a_little heavy
which_is to_be expected
but_otherwise really really_really_good
it_was soo good_that i_had_to have_it twice during_my weekend stay in_town
if_i ever find myself wishing i_wasn't in_the_riviera casino
i_know i'll be swinging by_here to kill time as_well as_my time
the_food_here_is amazing
we_went_with some_friends that_were visiting from out_of_town
and_they loved_it so_much_that we_went twice in days
the_best_thing about_this_place_is that the_food_is_fresh_and tasty_and very_close_to homemade food
the_masala_dosa is crisp_and yummy
infact we_had many_people looking curiously at what this food_was
the veg_dishes including palak_paneer come_with a naan_and_rice
our friends tried the_tandoori combo which was_very_good as_well_as_the fish_curry and goa chicken
the_ambience_is ok but_the_food_is really_good
it's a_real shame this_place_is in_the nasty old riviera
because it_really is_as_good_as everyone says
one_of_the things i_hate about every other_indian_restaurant i've_been_to_in vegas is_that_i always feel like_i pay a_lot and_don't get_a_lot
well
not_here
the_portions_are ginormous a_great_value
and the_two dishes_we_ordered were fabulous
i_can't_wait_to_go_back and try_more
i_just_wish we_didn't have to_go_to_the riviera to do_it
this would_get stars_if i_didn't_have to_sit_in a nasty food_court and_eat their yummy food off_of a paper plate
if_you_can get over that
though
do_it
it's_worth_it i promise
butter_chicken
hmm
what to_make of_this_place
it's indian_food
in_a_food_court
in_a_strip hotel
ok so_it's the_riviera
but_still
cutting to_the chase
the_butter_chicken_was yummy
it_had bell peppers in_it
which stood out for_some_reason
maybe because_there usually aren't bell peppers in butter_chicken
idk
i_liked what they_brought to_the party
the_plate comes_with a_good_amount_of basmati_rice
and_a ginormous piece_of_naan
in_my_book
it_doesn't get much better_than savoring some_delicious butter_chicken sauce_with some_naan
so the_food_was_good
but back_to_the place
the_fact_that we_even have indian_food in_a_food_court in_this town makes_me happy
the down side is_that you're paying more_for it
like_i said
it's in_a_strip hotel
albeit the_riviera
they're probably paying a_lot for_that location
so their prices_are naturally higher
i_mean
for a_plate_of butter_chicken isn't insane
but_it just feels weird because you're in_a freakin' food_court
in_any case
i_left satisfied
i_wouldn't go_out_of my_way to_eat_there again
but_i'd consider it if_i'm ever back in_the_riviera
like the_next_time_i watch some roller derby
p
s
i pretty much always_order mango_lassi if they_offer it
i've_had better
but it_was_pretty_good
one hella restaurant
not_sure why are they stuck inside riviera
do_not underestimate the_quantity
for_me_and my_friend who skipped breakfast and_went straight to_lunch we could_not finish the_thali non_veg and_tandoori
butter_chicken
friendly_staff
limited seating in_the common area in the_outside food_court
vegetable_samosas with_a delicious and_refreshing spicy cilantro sauce_to complement both the_samosa and_the tamarind_sauce that comes_with it_too
the_palak_paneer is so_delicious and_not_too over spiced or under seasoned_and it's accompanied with_a_large naan_bread that has_been warmed on the_grill along side a bed_of soft fluffy fragrant jasmine rice
my_mouth is watering already
this_place_is indeed a_hidden_gem in_the culinary world of_the_strip
it's in_the_riviera casino's food_court
who would of known
i_just happened_to had walked inside with hunger and_the scent of_indian home cookery led me_to this fabulous place
if_you_are hungry
the servings are enough_for to_share
and_are on_a budget
but not_in_a palate budget
then come over for_some darn delicious_food
plus
the_staff_was so calm
patient and_helpful
i_will come_here again on my_next trip_to_vegas
fast
friendly_service
big portioned tasty_food
drawback
plastic utensils
this_place_is_a modest great place_to_eat some quick indian_food
very_tasty
very reasonaable
their aloo_tikki chat is_one_of_my fav
my_only prob with_them is_their limited menu and_their south_indian isn't all_that great
all said i_liked eating_there for_my stay there
so out_of stars
what a_hidden_gem
as_good_as_the food_is
india_masala should consider a_full restaurant
we_had_the famous vegetable_samosa to_start_with
and_the_chicken_tikka_masala and masala_dosa was_very well_seasoned and freshly made_with a over sized piece_of_naan
jasmine rice also comes_with the_tikka_masala
the_food_is_delicious_and they_give_you plenty of_it
the_staff_was_friendly
seating_area is_limited since its a_food_court
the_prices_are a_bit high for_indian_food in_a_food_court but_after eating_here it_was well_worth_it
i had_their vegetarian combo two_days in_a row
it_did taste really_good
it_was_spicy enough_for me
i_wouldn't mind even_if it_was_a_bit more_spicy
i_love spicy_food
the_only_downside was they_had almost the_same item in_the combo on both days except one_dish
the_naan_was too thin and_a_bit crisp for_my_taste
i_also tasted dosa_which was_really_good
i would_love_to come back_to_this_place next_time i_am_in_vegas
yum
went_here_with misti y last_night before_the roller derby event and was_really impressed
their_naan
included with entree
comes_out big
savory_and soft with_lots_of air pockets
and the_chef's recommendation of 'medium hot' spice for my_entree was_pretty perfect
i_got_the chicken_tikka_masala
and look_forward_to trying the_vegetable_korma next_time
while waiting_for my_order
i wandered down the_food_court to_check_out_the other vendors and happened upon the india_masala gaylord india mini truck parked outside i had_no_idea that the_rio hotel's gaylord india restaurant_was related to_this food_court satellite
makes_me want_to try gaylord india as_well
and
while_we_were waiting we ran into_a cool elite yelper couple that misti had_never met in person
india_masala is open late
past am
and curiously the late_night menu_is smaller but_more expensive by
i_guess they kind of have_a monopoly on masala after pm on_the_strip
stars
if my_dish were or instead_of
i_would_give india_masala stars in_a heartbeat
my current late_night fix has_been pm happy_hour sushi
if we_can figure out how_to park close_to_the india_masala mini truck i_think_this could_be a_solid afterparty spot
joining the likes of soyo
herbs rye
satay
slidin' thru hq and bazic
we_needed our indian fix and yelped this_place
be_warned it_is_in an_old casino food_court
the people_were nice_and_the huge skinny piece_of_naan bread made_up alittle for_the
tag on_the chicken_tika_masala
the_sauce_was kinda greasey and runny like soup but you_get_a plate full
the_spiciness was sharp and harsh
for a_food_court ot was_good_and only ok for a_restaurant
i_took the suggestions and_had_the dosa masala
i_also added some vegetable_pakoras
and they_were_all very_good
very_tasty
well prepared
very_much worth_the_price
i_like_to judge ethnic food by how_many people_of that ethnicity are actually present at_the_restaurant when_i_am there eating
its safe to_say_that the_indian community is_well aware_of india_masala and_are pleased with_the_food that_is presented there
that to_me
is_a sign_of a_winner
good india food_with a_fast_food concept
its located inside the_riviera hotel and was_the_only good option_for lunch
the food_tastes good_and is reasonably_priced for vegas
the_quantity deserves a_special mention too
stop_by for_a_quick tasty bite
shockingly good
was_actually staying at_this hotel and lo and behold really good_indian_food downstairs
it_was_very authentic_and tasty
definitely recommended if you happen_to need indian_food after_a night of partying
visited india_masala last weekend after looking_for_good india food on_yelp
the_food
hit_the_spot
was_very authentic_and i_guess the_best_indian_food_i ever had_in_vegas
it is_located_in riviera's food_court
not_the_best place_in_vegas
but_the good_food compensates for the_ambience
stars_for food
ambience
i_would_definitely_go again
found_this_place around midnight on_a_saturday
there_was_only one guy working_there
so_my chicken_curry_and samosas order took about_minutes
well worth_the_wait
cost about bucks but_was plenty for_people
this_was by_far_the best_curry i_have_had_in the_states
let alone vegas
it beat out_all other fancy indian joints by far
only_thing it_was_a notch too spicy_for_me
and_i_love hot_food
i_highly recomend this diamond in_the rough
after misti y
's hall monitor cmye
a_few_of us decided_to walk across to the_riviera for_some india_masala action
its location_is kinda odd being part_of a_food_court than a_free standing restaurant
their_menu_is pretty extensive
offering curries
dosas
and_vegetarian items as_well
i split the_tandoori grill combo with_the wifey and_the_portions_were pretty generous
but the_price
was_pretty steep for a_food_court entree
taste_is everything_and every_bite was_delicious as_was_the naan and_chutneys that_came_with our_order
we_don't frequent indian dining spots as_much
because my_stomach is craving goyemon most_of_the time
but i'd_like_to return to_try_their other_items
aloha
yelp challenge
namaste
the_last dosa place we_went_to in_vegas charged us around_for rice
so we_came_here looking_for_a new dosa spot and weren't disappointed
the_dosa_was all_that it_should_be
and_the coconut_chutney was_light and_refreshing
my fiancee is obsessed with coconut_chutney
so_he didn't_even bother with the_tamarind_chutney
i_had_an order_of_naan
and_ate it with_the sabar
just_had lunch somewhere_else
the_best_part for me_was_the mango_lassi
it's_just the_way i_like_it
which_is not_overly sweet
i'd go_back just_for_the lassi
my fiancee will_return for_another dosa
def rec
its located_in food_court area_of rivera
there r other good_indian options_on strip
i_prefer tamba over this
indian masala is_probably the_only_place that_serves good south_indian_food in_las_vegas
the_food_is_good and is_worth_the money
look no further for the_best_indian_food on_the_strip
not_like there_was fierce competition
it's_pretty interesting that_it popped up_at the_food_court of the_riviera of_all places
i'm_still trying_to figure out why it's here
do guests of the_riviera have a_strong fever that can_only be satiated with tremendous curry flavors
all_i see are old people playing slots
it_doesn't matter though
i'm_just glad it's here and_it's tremendous
not_only do they_have every curry you_could want but they_serve a_lot_of south_indian_dishes most_places don't
i_only wished i_was hungrier when_i came to_try_more things
we_ended_up ordering the_tandoori combo which_included different meats_and the_saag_paneer accompanied by orders_of naan
everything_was_delicious and_i can't_wait_to_go_back_and try_more menu_items
the_two reasons for no star_rating are the_location
hate the_parking garage
and_the_price which_is_a couple extra dollars more_than other_places
there_are too_many indian_options off_the_strip for_lunch at better price points and_they're all_you_can_eat
still
it_doesn't take away from how_good their_food_is
i_can't_believe i_actually have_a reason to_go_to_the riviera now
very_good_indian_food
highly_recommended than_other options on_the_strip
though located in_a_food_court within riviera casino
the_food_is tasty_and worth_the buck
best dish_was shahi_paneer
it_was desi dhaba style
enough quantity for_both me and_my_wife
their naan's were_nice and_crispy
south_indian food_was_decent
nothing good_or bad about_it
for_the few_days we stayed on_the_strip
we_went_here couple_of_times and it_was_worth_it
service_was_quick and_good
i_think_the location makes this_place a_little_less popular and unknown to the_crowd
if_you_have_a car or any_other means to_get here
i_think its totally_worth it_though
you_can avoid the crowds and_have some_nice indian_food here
the_food_is one_of_the worst i_had in_a_long_time
curd or yogurt in_my papdi chaat was_so sour and the_potatoes ice cold
i_just ended up throwing it_off in garbage
easily some the_best_naan you'll ever taste
it's too_bad that not many folks will_ever find_this gem in_its hidden location in_the_riviera
the_riviera food_court has absolutely no ambience
but if_you_like_indian the_food_is_very_good
best_indian_food_in_vegas
always lines of_people waiting
but the_wait is_so worth_it
its made_fresh and trust_me you_can taste it
i_dont know what my_favorite is
because theres so_much
must_try
based_on_the looks and location of_this_place
you_would never guess how_good it_is
i_went_there with_two relatives who_were visiting from southern india and_we_all loved_the_food
the_dishes_were deliciously authentic and_the_portions_were very_generous
the_tandoori_chicken plate we_ordered was_cooked_to_perfection
i_also recommend the_masala_dosa
it's_a_great little_gem that i_can't_wait_to_go_back to next_time i'm_in_vegas
let me start_off by saying
i_only went_to_this_place because_of_the reviews i_read on_yelp
definitely not_disappointed
i truly would_have never found_this_place if_it_were not_for yelp
and probably even_if i_did
i would_have_been reluctant to_try_it since it_is in_a_food_court
if_you_are going_to india_masala it_is for nothing else but good_food
i_mean who says i_am_going_to the_food_court to_eat dinner
other_than maybe high school kids
prices_were a_bit_pricey for a_food_court but_it_is in_a hotel on_the_strip
however
to_my_surprise i_had more_than enough_food and_could hardly finish my_meal
i_paid about
for_a butter_chicken
spicy
meal with_rice
naan_and soda
i_definitely was_not_disappointed
you_wait a_little longer for_your food_than we would_be accustomed_to in_a_food_court setting but_my food_was_fresh and_oh so_good
i_am literally salivating now just thinking_about_it
my_only set back was_i had_one little piece_of lemon grass that_was too big so when_i bit into_it it_was_not fun for_me
good_sign for_me is when_i see native people eating their own food
there_is nothing worse than going_to an ethnic place_to_eat and_you do_not see any people of_their own kind there
best_naan in_town
hands down
this_is definate must_try for_any indian_food lovers
you_can not_be_disappointed
it_is definate return and new fave for_me
located_in_the corner_of the_food_court at_the_riviera
easy_to miss
but well_worth_the search
the workers were_very_friendly
helpful_and patient
excellent_service
i_ordered_the chicken_vindaloo
requested extra_spicy
and my_friends ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
both_dishes come_with rice_and_naan
both come_out to after tax
both plates give large_portions relative to_all other_indian cuisines i've_been_to
chicken_vindaloo
kinda spicy
i_had hoped for spicier
but oh_well
i_loved_it
they_use dark meat from the_chicken_and don't skimp out_on your portion
the_potatoes could've been_better prepared
it_was_a_little hard or undercooked maybe
the_sauce_was amazing and_very well_spiced
rice was_okay
no comments there
the naan_was_great and_fluffy
and_it_was_pretty heavily glistened with butter
chicken_tikka_masala
i tasted some_of_my friend's tikka_masala_and i_thought_it_was also really_good
definitely_one_of_the best plates i've_had for_indian_cuisine
it_was reasonably spicy and_spiced perfectly
not many_other comments since_i only tasted it
my hour drive back_in traffic was terrible
not because_of_the traffic
but because everytime_i thought about the_chicken_vindaloo i_had
my_mouth would salivate
heavily
hell
even as_i write this_review
i'm practically drooling
next_time i'm_in_vegas
i'm definitely coming_back_here
what_a_great surprise in_a_food_court
a_little expensive
but the_best_food available in_the_riviera hotel
healthy and_full_of_flavor
not_bad for_indian fast_food
food_was_fresh
hot
tasted really_good
and_the serves are_big
their dosa_and sambar is_very_good
their butter_chicken_was done right and_the_naan served_with the_combo plates was_huge and_delicious
it_is_in the_riviera food_court so seating was limited during their busy hours and_the seating_area was_a_little dirty
will eat from here_again next_time im in_town but might take_it to_go_and eat_it in_the comfort of_my timeshare
i regretted not trying_out india_masala the_last_time_i was at_the_riviera
an_indian_restaurant in_a_food_court
i didn't_really trust it
but a_couple days later i_saw it on_yelp with_plenty_of good_reviews
so_when i_finally headed back_to_the riviera a_few_months later to_check_out roller derby
i_knew where my_dinner stop would_be
the_menu_is large_and has plenty_of_vegetarian options
we_were starving and_not sure_how large the servings would_be so_we_went a_little crazy
we_got an_order_of saag_paneer
vegetable_korma
and_a masala_dosa
the_saag and korma both came with_a_side_of rice_and_naan
while the_dosa came_with two chutneys
the_dosa came out first_and was_huge
i_know dosas_are large
but_i'm pretty_sure i_could_have thrown the_thing in lake mead and rode it around like_a boat
it was_full_of potatoes
peas
and_lentils and had_a_nice samosa taste to_it
i_was_so hungry that_i completely forgot about_my chutneys and_didn't try_them at_all
boo
the_saag was_good
but lacking a depth of_flavor i_get at_mint and origin
it_wasn't_bad
but considering the_price_was the_same i'd rather eat_at one of_those two restaurants
the_vegetable_korma was_also_good but looked a_little different_from others i've_had
this_one_was more red in color
instead_of yellow
and_had_a smoky taste to_it
the sides of_rice were large_and you_get_a piece_of_naan the_size_of your_plate
i_love naan
but_this_one was_a_little boring for_me
plus one came out nice_and doughy while the_other was_overcooked and_had_a crunch to_it
we also_ordered a_mango_lassi and_it_was undrinkable
the consistency was_too thin_and almost tasted like spoiled yogurt
it went in_the trash
in_all
this_place_is_good and_i would_come_back if_we_were at_the_riviera
but_the prices_are_pretty ridiculous to_me considering they_are in_a_food_court
isn't_the point_of a_food_court to_get cheap grub instead_of paying the_extra money to_sit down somewhere
their appetizers
samosas_and such
were_about while the_dosa_was about
i_knew the_dosa_was more_food and therefore a_better deal so_that's why we_ordered_it instead_of an_appetizer
entrees_were around while combo platters were around
very_good options_and tasty_food
i_have_tried them_for the_first_time_and i_love_it
only_place i_found to_have south_indian_food without buffet
i_am definitely_going there_again and did_i_mention its
d
awesome
and late late late
sitrep
hot dam
what_a find when wandering along las_vegas blvd at am
menu
lv yelper paolo had recommended the_butter_chicken
naan
rice
all_good
and_this particular dish tends_to be_my
litmus test
for different places from seattle to sacramento to l
a
and_now vegas
and_i_have_to_say it_was de lish
price yikes
but the_combo was_about after tax and tip
with_this and something that_i_would consider to_be_very pricey if at_home or work
however
this_was_my vegas trip and in_most situations while traveling
i_won't spare the expense for the_experience
the lowdown
a_great_find in_vegas_for indian_fare
with it's hidden location inside the_riviera hotel
you_would never know about_it unless_you
yelp
ed it
on_a search_for great_indian_food
my dear friend_and fellow yelper found_this_place doing a_yelp search_for food_in_town
neither one us had_been there_before so_we figured why_not
what_the hey
i_can't_believe it's hours
that's epically fabulous
the_food served mild still_had kick and flavour
and_the_service_was fabulous
served fresh piping_hot
you have_to_wait a_bit to_get_your order but_if it means it's 'cooked to serve'
i'll take_it
headed back to_vegas tomorrowand you_can be_sure i_am attempting to_make_a stop at_the_riviera just for_my masala fix
excellent
the_veggie samosas_were spot_on
big
crispy on_the_outside
nice potatoes and_spices on_the in
butter_chicken_was nice
a_little tart
aromatic
sweet
chicken moist
very_nice dish
the_portions_are huge
naan_bread_is cooked_perfectly
crisp
soft
chewy
rating the_indian_food was_good
but not_great
but_it_was_a treat to_get any indian_food_in that food_court
had_the channa dosa
while good_and very_filling
it_was_a_bit one dimensional
when_i asked_for_it spicy
the handed me these generic hot_sauce packets that tasted like tabasco sauce
yuck
the_chutneys that accompanied the_dosa were_pretty bland_and generic too
but
as we_are staying here_for_a convention this week and_it's outside
would_be willing to_try_some other_dishes next_time
visited india_masala two more_times during_our stay at_the_riviera
it's still about
star experience
but_i rounded up_for_the following
owner was_very_nice_and helpful_and told_me that_if i_wanted spicy
just ask_for extra chilies
which_i did and_it_was much better_than cheap o packages of hot_sauce
she_also explained some_of_the more exotic items_on_the_menu to_me
the chicken_tika_masala was_ok
granted
it_was missing more of_the complex indian_spices and became one dimensional after a_few bites
but_the nan_bread was_hot fresh
and heck
it's a_food_court and_much better_than subway or pizza by_the slice
the veggie_samosas were_really quite_good and came_with tasty mint tamarind_sauce
great_food
great
worth_the_trip
i_know it's_in the_food_court of the_riviera
but_don't let that stop you from making_the trip_to this gem
this_place_is extremely good
it_is_the second best_indian resturant in_vegas
the_first being namaste
it_is_not a_hole in_the_wall just in an_off strip location
this_is where_the locals eat
tasty hr food
tried dosai
idli
uthappam
and veg briyani
everything_was good
except idli
it's little_pricey for_the_amount
but_in the_strip
it's acceptable
convenient location
if you_walk to_this_place or take_the bus or park in circus circus
rivera is_one_of_the very old casino's
they_still have_their dirt from_the day opened
including_the slowest elevator in_their parking
we_found_this_place at_the_riviera and_i_have_to_say it exceeded our expectations
just walking thru the_food_court and smelling the_spices made_me salivate
i_have_to_say some_of_the_best_indian_food i_have_had
i_had_the masala_dosa and_i_have_to_say this_is_one_of_the_best dosa i_have_ever_had
we_have_a few restaurants in_our city that_have dosa but it_does not measure up_to_the dosa here
it_was huge with_lots_of filling and the_sambar soup served_with it_was_spicy but_not_too spicy
i_have_not been to_vegas since may and every_time_i think_of the_dosa here_i start_to drool
my_boyfriend had the_tandori combo and_he_said it_was extremely good
i_cannot_wait to_go_back again
we_have_had tamba before_and while it_is_good and_they_offer goat my boyfriends favorite for basic indian_food_you cannot beat this_place
i_cant wait until my_next trip_to_vegas just to_have another masala_dosa from_here and_if they_serve them at am on_the late_night menu dont be surprized to_find me there
bomb
this_place_is so_good
the family_and_i wanted to_get_a bite to_eat before watching society of seven at_the riveria hotel and casino so_we made_our merry way_to the_food_court since there's_a variety to_choose_from
walking up_to_the food_court
you_can instantly smell the_wonderful spices used in_indian_food
i_love_indian_food so of_course i_didn't_care to_check_out_the other spots
i_wanted some curry_and naan
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka masal
chicken_vindaloo and_naan
omg
so freaking good
both were_served_with white_rice
the_naan_was like the_size_of my face
it_was coated in butter and_i used it_to soak up sauce from_my dish
the_chicken_vindaloo was_my_favorite
it_was nice_and_spicy and_had a_ton_of flavor
i devoured the_whole thing and_ate some_of_the chicken_tikka masal since that_was my sister's dish
she liked_it too
it_could have_been spicier but that's_just personal preference
it_was kinda expensive but indian_food is_kind_of expensive as_is
each entr_e was
and_the_naan_was
the_food_took a_while_to come_out but_it_was worth_the_wait
i_got_a cup_of water and_the_guy said if_i wanted more water he'd fill it_up for_me
that was_nice of him
i_really_like this_place
when_i go_back_to vegas
i_will for_sure come_here_for my_indian fix
i'm craving_indian_food for_dinner now
best part
it's open hours
as_good_as_it gets
very_very_good indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas blvd
indiamasala dosa samber same like chennai taste
we_had wonderful food' less price
lot_of_food
the_food might take a_while_to come_out
just expect it
then_it won't be as painful
i_went_here based_on_the reviews_here
i_was suspicious first but i_decided_to_give a_shot since_i_was staying at riviera hotel anyway and was_too tired to_go far for_food yesterday
it turned_out
the_place_was awesome
i_ordered my_usual for_indian_food
chicken_tikka masara
to_go
it_came with_rice_and_a huge naan
plenty for one_person
i_was_so full_of the container but_i hated to_see_the rest go wasted so powered through to_finish the_whole thing
i_didn't_have a microwave to warm it_up next day so saving leftover wasn't an option
it_was_that good
mango_lassi_was also_delicious too
perfect consistency and not_too_sweet
i_give stars_because i_think_the price is_a_bit steep for a_food_court
if you make_it to_go
remember to_grab silverwares and napkins
they_are a_food_court joint after_all so they_don't put those gears in a_bag for_you
you_need_to grab them yourself
i_cant stand indian_food
sorry its just_not my cup_of tea
but my_wife kinda likes it and_wanted_to try_it here
the_food_court here in_the_riviera is literally a ghost town
i_cant comprehend how all_the eateries stay_in business
she ordered_a non_veg plate that came_on a_little prison plate with tiny little compartments of_food_and a_big piece_of bread
she said_it all tasted pretty_good and_she easily finished it_all
and_she doesnt have a_big appetitie
the_cost w o drink_was over
which_is outrageous for food_court food during_lunch
i_know this_is vegas_and eveything is overpriced a_bit
but every_other eatery had equal sized portions for half the_cost
plus my_wife got really sick after eating_it
i_love me some_indian masala and_this_place does indian exactly how i_like_it spicey and_fresh
you will_not_go hungry here
and_the_price is_perfect
we_had_the buffet
its so killer
i_have_to go_back soon
mmmm mmmmmmm good
get_some
the downside is_that this_is_a relatively simple place_for_indian_food
seriously
what can_you expect_from a_food_court of_this size
everything_is authentic_and aimed in_the right direction
but_at the_same_time everything falls just_a hair short_of what_it likely would_be if_it_were a standard restaurant
to_their credit
they_have_a reduced menu even through the_middle_of_the night
it's_a blessing if you're stuck in_the_riviera at am and nobody wants_to walk down the_strip
it's_not the_kind_of place_to_go out_of your way for
but_if_you wind up stuck at_the_riviera or circus circus and need to_fill_up in_the_middle_of_the night
it's_one_of your best picks
horrible horrible horrible
we_ordered over phone to_pick_up
when_we came_to our hotel room we_were shocked to_see burnt naans
burnt to_the core
and_the parts where is_not burnt it_is_not cooked at_all
how could someone cook like_this
what_a waste of_money
great_indian_food
i_had_the tikka_masala very spicy_and_it delivered
obviously it's_a british dish
the_naan_was_good too
hot_and soft_and the_bottom was crispy
the people_working were_very_nice too
i_love_indian_food
it_is_a recent obsession and i_know_the good_stuff when_i see it
the_food_at this food_court location is_very_good
the_naan_is fresh_and_tasty
all_of_the entrees_are made_fresh to_order
so let_the cooks know how_spicy you enjoy your entrees
service
the_staff_is use to tourists and questions
they_were very_friendly_and knowledgeable about_the products sold
wait_time
everything_is cooked fresh
if_you_are_in a rush
go_to quiznos subs
the_food_is worth_the minute wait while_they cook_it
price
pretty pricey_for a_food_court
it_was for_two waters
to entrees
an_app of samosas_and bread
this_is the_same_price we pay at_a sit down restaurant
the_drinks are_not included_in the_combo price
location
it appears they share a kitchen with a_burger joint
strange for_an_indian joint
try_this_place if_you_are at_the rivera casino
best_indian_food on_the_strip
and_the sweetest service you'll find_at any_indian_restaurant anywhere
went for_the_buffet it_was_ok will_go_back if in_the_area
at_first we_were very_excited to_have food_here because_of_the great_reviews
very disapppointed
food was_cold
tasteless and had_to_wait more_than min
there_are_better sit down choices
please spend ypur money
at_a sit down place and_get service with the_meals
gave_it two star
one star_for_the convenience and another_star since they_had_a water dispenser on_their counter
would_not_recommend
the_good
open hours
dosa tastes well
food_is ready in less than minutes
the_bad
other_items such_as chana_masala or chilli panner tastes bad
always_order something that_can_be prepared fast like dosa
bad_food
we_ordered_a plain dosa_and veggie combo the_plain dosa_was hot came_with sambhar and_chutneys sambhar had_no salt and_was watery
chutneys_were watery_and cold
i_think made few days_ago
veggie combo had rice
naan
chole
palak_paneer
curd and dal
the_palak_paneer hardly had_any paneer_and was firm
chole dal salt less
curd was thin_and sour
i_think made_up few days_ago
not_worth the_money
just_a temporary way_to kill hunger
review by an_indian
wish_i could give_this_place negative stars
waited over an_hour for an_order_of chicken_curry
the_employees seemed_to have_no sense_of urgency at_all
they_would stop to_fill_up water containers even though_there were_about a_dozen people waiting
when_we finally_got the_curry
it_was watery and_the_chicken_was dry
not worth_the_wait or money
ill never ever_go here_again
food_is served fresh
very_close_to home_made food
if_you_are looking for_an_indian_restaurant
this_is_the_place open round the clock
first_off
i_have_to tell you that_i'm indian
so_i'm probably going_to_be a_little_more critical of_this_place than_most others
i paid_for the_vegetarian thali
which_was pretty expensive_for food that_comes in_a styrofoam plate from a_restaurant in_a_food_court
the_food_at this_restaurant_is the_kind_of stuff that_they probably cook once a_day all_in one batch
and_then serve throughout_the day
unfortunately
if_you_go there_at am like_i did
the_food they_serve you_might be_a_little stale from sitting_out all_day
i've_eaten here twice because_i feel sorry for these people who don't seem_to get very many customers
but_i_don't_think i'll eat_here again
the_food just isn't good
and_the_prices_are way_too high
the_yelp review says this_place_has four_stars
this ranking clearly applies to_the_food
which_is indeed tasty_and fresh
well prepared
naan_was puffy
doughy and_crispy
what did_not seem_to warrant the stars was the_location this_place_is located_in the_food_court of the_riviera
the excellent_food
served_on paper_plates with plastic forks within_the common area_of the court brought_a feeling of anticappointment not the_kind_of ambience the four_stars erroneously suggested
come_for_the great_food
but take_it somewhere_else to_enjoy
hands_down_the_best_indian food_i had_in_vegas
only down side is
its in_a_food_court and_most times
i had_to_wait mins minimum to_get_my food
if_you_like tandoori
tandoori combo gives a_small portion_of different tandoori dish
caution
longer wait_time for this_dish
my_favorite
i_have_tried chicken_biriyani
butter_chicken combo
utthapam and_tandoori combo
this_is_a north_indian style kitchen_and expecting south_indian_dishes like uthappam to_be_good is_my mistake
biriyani was_decent
butter_chicken melted in_my_mouth
there_was_a girl on the_cash_register was explaining that her favorite drink is mango_lassi to one_of_the person ahead of_me in the_line
so_i wanted to_try_it_out
it turned_out_to be the_best of_all mango_lassi i_had
naan_was soft_and yummy
for tandoori combo may be little pricy
but better_than most indian_lunch_buffet i had_in_vegas
i learned that_they_have another_restaurant near the_strip where they_have buffet
india_masala bar grill e flamingo rd las_vegas
nv
and more_like proper restaurant
i_am_going_to try_it the_next_time when i_will_be in_vegas
this joint is_located_in riviera hotel's food mall
you_can park for_free at riviera self parking at_the rear of the_riviera casino
bottom_line
nice_little joint for_good tasty north_indian food
good_food
like their_tandoori combo and non_veg combo
people_working there_are friendly
would def visit_again and would_highly_recommend
guys i_wanted_to give_you_a star and_was about_to
but_when my_bf got home
checked his credit_card you_guys took it upon yourselves to_add
gratuity
humm first_off
the cashier was_not_very friendly
everthing
we_asked
for_you
where out_of
but over_all food_was tastey
next_time
i_am_in_vegas and on_that side_of strip i_will_go_back
after days on_the_strip staying at wynn and pallazo
i_needed some real flavor
this_place def filled that void
will_be_back next_time in_vegas
very unhygienic place_to_eat
open hrs
we_went_with friends ordered_naan
dosa
malai_kofta etc
dosa_is tasteless
food_tastes real bad at_this_place
but_i see most_of_the indians eating_here
i_would prefer going_to india_masala on e flamingo st
that_is definitely a_must_try if_you_want indian_food
a_handful_of years_ago
i_had_a successful night of luck at_the_riviera
whenever_i win big
i_want a_big meal
the_riviera buffet looked lacking
so_i wandered to india_masala and_got some_kind_of curry_dish
it_was_delicious
even with_the pp price tag
i happily paid it
and put india_masala as one_of_my_favorite secrets in_las_vegas
yeah well
that_was_a handful_of years_ago
i_went_back yesterday and ordered_the_tandoori combo
yuck
firstly
it's
which is_ok
it's on_the_strip
kinda on_the_strip
riviera isn't exactly a world class hotel
but_it's mostly a_plate_of chicken
a_plate_of very_dry chicken
the saving grace was_the_naan and_a_side_of curried beans
that saved the_dish from complete flavorlessness
it_also comes with_a_side_of sausage which i've_never_had before and_they_were okay
so
the_food_on this trip warrants stars
but_the overall ambiance of the_place_is stars
the_place_is open hours
that's nice
but_it shares the_space with a_burger place
the cashier was jumping from_the burger joint to_the_indian counter
hey
i'm all_about mom_and_pop shops
but_this_was not cute
it_was annoying
it's at least a min wait_for the_food_on a slow saturday_night
it_being slow on saturday should've been_a tip off
the_service_was polite
on par to_what i'd find_at subway
but_that's ok
i_don't go_to_indian places_for good_service
i_didn't_care for_the self serve lukewarm water on the_counter
in conclusion
this visit was
stars
i rounded up
but_i'm hoping the_first visit_here wasn't some far off dream
maybe they_had an_off day
look no further if_you_want very_good_food on_the_strip
well
almost
my_wife_and_i stayed at riviera for nights and_we_were pleasantly_surprised by the_quality_and taste_of_the_food here
don't_be fooled by the_fact_that it's_located in_a_food_court
the_food_is really_really_good
we_were so impressed that we_ended_up eating breakfast and_dinner everyday during_our stay
terrible food
too_much salt in_the_dishes
nothing is mild
everything we_ate was chili pepper spicy
i_know indian_food_is spicy
but the_dishes here were unbearable
read_the_reviews before_i went and_thought it_would_be a_great_experience
but should_have paid closer attention_to what they_really said
had_the_chicken_tikka_masala with a_mango_lassi
the_mango_lassi_was good
the_masala was over_priced for_the_quality it_was
it_is in_a_food_court and should be evaluated as fast_food
not_the greatest
but okay when_you_are hungry_and anything will_do
not_the_best if_you_are looking_for_good indian_food
though the_naan was_pretty_good
the question i had_to_ask was
where's the_chicken
too_much sauce for_the_amount_of meat
so
in_the_end
the_value to quality did_not justify the_price
but_if_you get_that late_night craving_for_indian_food in_the_city that never sleeps
this_would_be an okay stop as they_are_open hours
but_for a_great_meal of_indian_food
find somewhere_else
food_court quality
i_have_been staring at the_sign for_years and_finally decided to_try_this
honestly i_was_in there_for parsley which isnt open yet
however
decided_on trying this_place_out
had_the_tandoori sampler
was_overcooked meat mostly and_had_the total buffet taste going_on
no made_to_order and_was_not impressed
nan_was highlight but wouldnt repeat
good_food
ordered veg combo
shahi_paneer and_mango_lassi
naan was_amazing
a_little expensive but worth_it
r u tired by roaming on_the_strip
r u super hungry
go n order food from_here
order the_chicken combo and_enjoy all tandoori variety_of chicken
the_taste_of food_is_awesome
the_only good thing_about this_restaurant is_that_it_is open hrs
but the_menu after
is very_limited
we_went there_for_dinner
since_it_was late in_the night
and_nothing else_was open
food_was_decent
so_we thought_the breakfast the_next_day would_be good_too
but_their aloo paratha was not_at_all like_a reglar aloo paratha
the_aloo in it_was scarce
the_ambience_is a put_off too
since it_is_in the_food_court of_a vey old casino
appears shady compared_to all other casinos in_vegas
i would_not_recommend unless_you want_indian food_after pm
don't_go for_a look of_this_place cause this_place_is legit
i found_this_place almost two_years a go_and i_have_been_here few_times already and i_am_from houston
it's quick_service and_it's delicious
i_love_their daal
i_make sure i_come_here every_time i_am_in_vegas
terrible_service
food_is bland no real_indian taste
on_the plus side they_are_open hours
good_food order veg combo shaai paneer
and_mango_lassi naan was_amazing
good_experience
this_place_is extremely overpriced_for a_small take_out place in_a dirty little corner_of the_riviera casino
the_place_is very shabby
and_no_one would ever want_to sit and dine here
the_portions_are really_really small_for_the_price they_charge
the_plates in_which they_give the_food out are made_of very thin paper and_all_the gravy of_my curry_was sunk into_it
trust_me no_one would ever want_to dine here if_there_was a_choice
i eat_indian_food today after three day stay in_las_vegas i_can't stop to say_this_is best_and wonder full place_to_eat indian_food
i hop you will_try too
worst place
customer_service_is horrible
they started_off by getting my_order wrong then when_i_went back_to have_it fixed he_told me he_could not help me because_i forgot my ticket upstairs
he_then told_me he_would give_me my money back and_then said
get_the fuck out_of_my restaurant along_with a spanish curse word
if_i_could give them negative points i_would
that kind of behavior is_not acceptable ever
oh_my this_place_is so_good i_really_love indian_food i_know_the good_stuff servic was_very_good friendly chicken_tikka_masala very_good not_spicy thanks india_masala
they_served good_food
naans are made_to_order
food was_quite_good
and they_are_open hours
my_boyfriend_and_i checked_in to the_hotel around am and_we_were hungry
since_it's the_only fast_food place_in_the hotel we_got food from_here
we_got_the chicken_tikka_masala
we_got up_to our room and the_room and began eating and_the_chicken_was cold
the_sauce_was warm but_the the_chicken wasn't warm at_all
so my_boyfriend called down to_tell the_restaurant our_food_was cold_and the_person that took_our_order said we_took to long and hung up in_his face
i_called back_and ask_if the_manager was_in
he said_no
so_i_asked for_his name and_he gave_me_a fake name
so the_next_day my_boyfriend went down to_talk_to the_manager_and they_gave him another_meal free
for fast_food indian_food it_had_a pretty_good taste but some_of their workers are unprofessional
had a_couple_of excellent meals here_and plan_on many more
the huge_menu demands return visits
if you_feel overwhelmed by_the choice on_offer the_staff_are happy_to suggest dishes
it's unlicenced
but_there_is no corkage so pick up_some booze from one_of_the off licences on nicholson street
a tip though
it's a_family_run place_with a_small kitchen staff
so go early
especially if_you're_a large_party
the_food_is well worth_the_wait though
as_someone who's not_usually a_fan_of_indian restaurants
i_have_to_say i_love_this_place
run_by two generations of_the extremely welcoming ali family
kismot offers all the_usual dishes you'd_expect to find_in on_the_menu in_an_indian_restaurant
but_what sets this_place apart are_the things you certainly wouldn't expect to_see
the chocolate naan_bread
although it_may sound strange
goes extremely well_with_the spiciness_of a_curry disha dn is_definitely_worth trying
what_i wouldn't recommend to_anyone but_the bravest is_the
spiciest_curry in scotland
according_to the_menu_and all the_staff
i_wasn't plucky enough to_give_it_a go myself
but_i having spoken to people that_have
i'd say it's_definitely not_for_the faint hearted
in contrast to so_many family_run local restaurants
the d_cor in kismot is upmarket
clean_and elegant
this
combined with_the unique atmosphere_and great choice_of dishes to_choose_from
is_what_i think makes_it such_a success
for_curry and_rice naan for_two_people you_can expect_to_pay
and_there_is also_the option_of byob
definitely worth_a_visit
especially_if you're looking_for somewhere to_cater for large groups
this_place sets the_standard for a_family_run restuarant
it_feels_like your guests in_their home
the_food_is_outstanding
choclate nan was_a_bit sickening at_first
but_i_found myself eating the_whole thing
for a_main i_got_the lamb_biryani with_some mushroom bhajee on side
everything_was perfectly_cooked
especially_the bhajee
these_guys are the_only people in_the_city that do_it right
it's_all very cheap too
please visit
kismot
you_are one_of_the most impressive restaurants i_have_been_to in_edinburgh
there_are two parts to_this story that show why i_think_this
food
just superb
easily the_best_indian_food that i_have_eaten thus far
i_was part_of a_large_group of over
and we_paid a fixed price each to_get_a large number_of naans and bhajees
and a_selection_of different curries along_with plentiful amounts of_rice
all_of_the curries_were incredibly tasty
and_most_of them didn't last long at_all on_our_table
kismot also provides some interesting dishes_that i_have_not seen replicated anywhere else
you_can get chocolate naan
no
that's_not a typo
which sounds worth_a go
although_i haven
t tried_it myself
they_also serve what_they call_the 'kismot killer'
a stupidly hot curry that sounds more_like torture than food
if_you_can eat_it all
you get_it for_free
though their_website suggests
and_i quote
it_is recommended that_you put your toilet roll in_the freezer when_you return home
you actually have_to sign a disclaimer before_you eat_it
service
the_restaurant_is run_by a_family team
with_the parents in_the_kitchen
and_the eldest son commanding the_front of house
it goes without saying_that the parents do_a great_job behind_the scenes in_the_kitchen
it_is_the front_of house experience that puts the icing on_the ca
curry for_me
throughout_the_meal
we_were attended to in_the ideal way attentive
but_not intrusive
orders_were taken in_a cheery manner
and_he even joked with_us as we_sat and_waited
his manners were truly impeccable
and_he saw us_out of_the_restaurant personally at the_end_of_the_meal
i_have_never before or since experienced better customer_service
as_you_can see
i_love_this_place
you_just have to_go_there
cancel tonight's dinner plans
and make_a_reservation at kismot
you_will keep coming_back_for more
without_a doubt one_of_the finest indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
the inviting and_friendly atmosphere
of_which the ali family are_very proud
immediately creates a_pleasant eating environment
the_food_itself is_excellent
combining the_traditional dishes you_would_expect of_any self respecting curry_house with a_wide array_of regional specialities
particularly_good is_the north_indian chilli garlic
and_as_a man who doesn't like to_have his palate destroyed by excessive spice
its strength
as with all_the_dishes
can_be adjusted to_your taste
and why_not accompany your curry_with the strange sounding but weirdly delicious chocolate nan_bread
although alcohol is_not served
there_is the option_of byob with_the added advantage_of no corkage
kismot pride themselves on a_fun atmosphere and_as_a result it_is_an ideal place_to book large parties
with_their group menus affordable and surprisingly varied
overall then an_excellent place
whether for_a_great group night_out or if_you_want to_try_the infamous kismot killer
vying for the_place of spiciest_curry in scotland
thank_you to the_yelp community for turning me_and_my family onto kismot
we_were_not_disappointed
what an incredible dining_experience
i_am visiting edinburgh from nyc and_i_really wish_i could take this_restaurant home with_me
it_is_a truly
family_run
establishment
we_were_greeted by_the sons of_the husband_and wife chefs who work together to_make every homemade item on_the_menu
i_wish_i_had written down all_the_dishes we_had but_i_can tell you that_no matter_what you_order you_will devour every morsel
in_addition_to the outstanding food
my entire family agreed
best_indian_food we have_ever_had
and we_have_had a_lot
the_service_was top_notch
everything came out in_a timely fashion which_was so impressive since_it_was obviously homemade
we_got a_chance_to meet the_chef after the_meal to praise him and tell him about his fabulous yelp_reviews
and_then promised to_write another to_make_sure he maintains that star_rating he so deserves
to_anyone visiting edinburgh
you_must must visit kismot
we_will_definitely_be_back before_we depart
thank_you kismot for_a superb experience
we_just returned from dinner_at kismot with mixed reviews
we_ordered_the family curry
literally the_curry that the_owner family makes and eats itself
saag panir
spinach with cheese curry
vegetable_samosas and_two kinds_of bread naan and_garlic paratha
we_were welcomed by a_very genial host and_were ready_to love_it
however
the_samosas_were teensy tiny little triangles in filo dough
the filo and_two sauces that_came_with it totally overwhelmed the thimbleful of stuffing
we then waited and_waited and_waited for_our main_courses and bread while people who arrived after us_ordered and were_served
our_order wasn't odd or difficult so_i'm_not sure_what the lag was
usually filling time before dinner conversing with my_companion is_a joy but we'd had_a challenging day and_the_wait was_just too_long
finally the food_arrived
the_family chicken_curry_was delicious but_i'm not_sure it_was what i'd actually ordered
the_owner_and 'warned' me that_there_was some unusual lemon lime fruit in the_curry that_was typical of bangladeshi food_and you_could only get_it if_you_have_a bangladeshi friend or traveled there
i_was feeling adventurous so_i_ordered it
the_dish_was really yummy but nary a bangladeshi lemon in the_whole thing
i_asked_the host about_it and_he_said the lemon was in_the_sauce but
seriously
i_know_what lemon tastes_like and_it_wasn't there
whatevs
the_naan_bread was_very_good too
on_the_other_hand
the_saag panir was seriously under seasoned_and just_didn't have much_flavor
very atypical of_indian_food
the_garlic paratha was_good while hot but_not palatable once it_got cold
we_were expecting to_be wowed based on_all the_yelp_reviews but_this_one only gets stars_for_the underseasoned food_and_the long long_wait
a_real family_run affair
kismot serves some_of_the best_curry i_have_eaten in_edinburgh
rich
flavorful_and depending on your_choice hot
the_staff_are personable and_have_a real love of_curry
and_are happy_to recommend dishes if you fancy something different
alongside the_curry they_do something special when_it_comes_to nan_bread
to_be precise chocolate nan
any chocolate bar you_can think_of has likely ended up inside a kismot nan at_some_point
it can_be_a_little theatrical when someone orders a kismot killer
google it
but_this all adds the_the welcoming atmosphere
overall i_would_recommend kismot
great curry_and service
went_on_a team night_out to kismot at christmas and it_was_fantastic
the_service
from_the detail they went into at_the booking stage
we_were a_group_of
to_the welcome we_received on_the night_was authentic_and real
and_i immediately started recommending it_to people even before_i ate my_first bite
we_had_a sharing menu
which_was fabulous value_for_money
there_was so_much_food we_couldn't finish_it
extremely useful to_know that_it_is byob and
at_the_time of writing
there_is no corkage charge
yes
no charge
how refreshing
this_is_a not many frills place
plain tables_and decor
it's_all about_the_food you_see
so_if_you are_happy with_that before you_go your expectations will_be blown_away and_you_will have_a_great night
it_is efficient
clean_and friendly
like_all the_best places_in_town
the_chicken_and mango curry was_a hit as were_the huge pakora that_came out_as starters
absolutely lovely family fare
have a_great_time when you_go this is_some_of_the_best curry in_edinburgh
we_visited edinburgh
scotland during spring break and heard_about this_restaurant
the_entire family was extraordinarily nice and_welcoming
we_ordered_the korma_and vindaloo
the pickel tray was_amazing with_all_the breads
we_also_tried the_okra and_spinach side_dishes and_that were_perfect
my year old loved the_tandoori_chicken_and chocolate milkshakes
we_will_definitely come_back
all_the_way from texas
others may be_so inclined to usher you towards the_mosque_kitchen for_some traditional food
but they'd be doing you_a massive disservice
kismot is_absolutely one_of_the tastiest restaurants_in_edinburgh
i've been a_handful_of times
and_each_time it_has_been stellar
a_recent development that left_me a_bit underwhelmed was their_menu redesign
the_menu_has been drastically cut and_the star_rating system has_been scrapped
now
you're left_with merely three levels of_heat
mild
medium and_hot
i take heat relatively well_and medium had_me sweating in_my seat
in_case you're wondering
they_also offer the kismot killer challenge for
i_think
it's_a ridiculously hot dish that_is chilli seeds
our friend from bangalore was pressured into accepting the challenge
and_he_was less than thrilled to_be eating_it
after three big hulking bites he quit
the_staff here_is stellar
they_are super_nice
talkative
accommodating and knowledgeable
if_they take_a liking you_may even meet auntie in_the_back
the_only_reason this_place_is receiving stars and_not is_the loudness
the_place_is very open and conversations echo quite_a_bit
therefore
if_a stag or hen party is_there then you_may as_well assume you_won't_be hearing much else than_their banter
the_place_is byob
very friendly_service with_some secret recipe treats included to_make_the meal more interesting_and fun
good_selection_of curries
but get_there early or book ahead
plenty_of_vegetarian options too
this may be the_best_indian i_have_ever_had
i've_had several curries on_this long trip
but wow this_one wins the prize
they_are also byob
which_is fairly common in the_states at asian and indian_restaurants
but perhaps not as_much here
so_it_was a_very_nice treat to_bring loads_of wine_and beer for the_group
dimly lit
casual atmosphere
and_friendly_service
there_were about ten of_us in a_group
but_everything went really smoothly
started_with some_delicious chicken pakoras with a_few_different sauces
then followed it_up with_the_chicken deshi khani and_a_side_of the_best
freshest sag alu i've ever_had
the deshi khani is advertised as_being
limited availability
and a_special
particularly authentic curry
spicy
rich
and succulent
it was_one_of_the_best curries i've ever_had
and_the sag alu
not_the fatty
but delicious
creamy spinach you usually_get at_indian_restaurants
this was_fresh_and brimming with spice
would've been happy to_get_it as a_main with paneer
but i_didn't_think to_do_so because_i figured it_would_be pretty standard instead_of spectacular
and_i_was wrong
my_friend_ordered something they_used_to serve but_is no_longer printed on_the_menu_and they_still make_it for_her
fragrant pilau_rice and_hot
crispy garlic_naan made this such_an outstanding meal
i'd beeline here the_next_time_i was in_edinburgh because as_far as_i'm concerned
this is_as_good_as indian gets
we_did some intensive research on where to_eat for_our recent trip_to edinburgh_and are_so glad_we stumbled on_this true gem of_a_restaurant to_experience
i'd checked out the_menu_and website so was_really looking_forward_to the 'family run' and 'authentic' kismot
even from_the initial call to reserve our_table there_was warm_and_friendly service and_a cheeky chappie attitude
we_arrived in_a taxi as the_actual restaurant_was situated outside_of_the city centre where_we stayed and_even the taxi driver had_heard great things about_the_place
we_were_greeted like family and_it_was clear from how_busy the_place_was that it's_a favourite of a_lot_of_people
we'd considered taking beer as_it's byob establishment but decided_to try sample the novelty of_just the_curry instead
the_staff_were_very buzzy
and we_were_seated in the_corner by the_window where_we had ample opportunity for_people watching and_the to_see into the_kitchen which_is_a great_experience in itself
the mam and dad do_the cooking and_the boys cousins uncles do_the waiting on
we_had poppadoms to chow over while_we considered the_menu_and with_them the_best pickle try ever all were_tasty
tangy and plentiful
we_ordered_a starter to_share and_i just had_to_try kismot naga pickle just to_be_able_to say i'd tried_it
the mr had_a sweat on just thinking_about_it
well it pained my insides so please take_care should you_feel brave enough to_try_it
the_small pot of_it which_was brought was sufficient to_taste but_not over indulge
the_starter of mixed tikka_was huge
all the_meat_was of_a good_quality and the_salad was_a_nice accompaniment
the_staff_were_very attentive_and when we_had_a time to_wait or_a break between courses one_of_them always came_over to_check we were_doing ok_and just_have general chit chat
we honestly felt like very special friends
for_main course we_had
lamb ada cooked with_fresh ginger
tomatoes
lemon methi leaves and strong eastern spices
chicken zeera roast cumin seeds
fresh herbs coriander
garlic_nan
again
the_portions_were huge
not_really a complaint but_the 'not so skinny brother' might have_taken a_bit_of offence that_we_were well_and truly stuffed_and seemed_like we_hadn't even made_a dent in_the_food and_had this not_been the st of out night stay we_would_have certainly taken the_rest home
the_meat_was great_quality and_the flavours just_as described
definitely notes of_food made_with experience and_love
the_bill was_almost embarrassingly minimal for what_we_had enjoyed but_it just shows you_don't have_to_pay over_the odds to_get truly good food_and_great_service
we_had_a_great time at_this_place and_have recommended it to_everyone who will listen for when_they visit edinburgh
we hope_to get_back to_it one_day
kismot shuts for a_family holiday in february
it closes for almost a_whole month and this_is_one_of_the reasons for_my increase in curry reviews
that month made_me realise that while some_other purveyors of_curry are really_good
i rate kismot above them
they_also recently reworked the_menu
dropping a_few_of the_less popular specialities and streamlining it
it now separates the_curries by spiciness
so depending on what_you fancy you_can focus on_one part
as the_old adage goes
absence makes_the heart grow fonder
kismot has earned five_stars from_me
i keep_coming back_and it_really is_the_best curry in_edinburgh
i_am_not_sure why i_haven't done a review_of kismot earlier as this_is_one_of_my favourite restaurants_in_edinburgh
i_have_been coming_here_for a_number_of years and_i think_this_is due_to_the proximatey of_the auld hoose alternative music
a_couple_of brews and_then onto a_curry
cannot beat that of_an evening for_me
onto_the restaurant the_decor has had_a_little bit_of_a face lift of late with_some newly designed posters
as has the_menu
not_going_to go into too_much detail as previous reviewers have mentioned this
but_it_is a_good_thing
one_thing that stuck me_is the_new additions to the_menu kismot naga pickle and iron bruna
yep a_curry with irn bru
this_is_a family_run restaurant_and_the sons greet you on the_door with a_bit_of friendly banter
you_can see the_other family members beavering away in_the_kitchen when_you first enter
the_food_here_is always up_to high standards and our_last outing was no_exception
we_opted_for the pickle trays
poppadoms
raitha and naga chilli pickle
all washed down with_lots_of mango_lassi
the_starter was_great but_the naga chilli in particular was_excellent
beware this comes_with an certificate warning and_is very_spicy
the main_courses were veg madras
chicken masalla
prawn passanda and_chicken_tikka north_indian chilli garlic
all_were great their chilli garlic is_still my_favourite version_of this disk in_edinburgh
one_thing to bear in_mind you_get lots_of rice_and_the nans are_large so unless_you ha vent eaten all_day a rice_and nan portion does easily
either that or it_was something to_do_with the_fact we_order another jug of lassi
but_i_don't_think i_ever come away as full eating any where else
thumbs_up from_me
favourite dishes here
mums desi khani
homemade curry_with limited availability
worth_a try if_you_are there_at the_weekend
mango_lassi by_the jug
bhindi
north_indian chilli garlic
any_of_the madras dishes
naga chili pickle
beware very_spicy
methi
raitha
easily the_best traditional style curry_house in_edinburgh
long since recommended but we'd never gotten around_to a_visit
we_loved it
the_service_was_great_and the knowledge of_the_food_was second to none
able to tailor our flavours to the_level_of heat we_wanted
and_since i'm_a softie and_my_wife loves_the intense heat this_was great
it reminded me of_the_best_indian_food i'd eaten as a_student
but better
i_cannot_wait to_go_back
i_was_looking_for a_nice restaurant in_edinburgh while_i_was in_town for a_short visit
and_decided_to give kismot a_try
the_food_was_excellent
and more_than sufficiently spicy
portions_were generous
and the_staff_was_very_friendly
i_am_very glad i_decided_to_try this_place_out
one bit_of advice
i_was lucky to_get in without a_reservation
as the_place_was quite busy
if you plan_to go
phone ahead
just dined here_last evening on_a trip_to edinburgh
read their reviews_on trip advisor and_had_to stop_by for a_bite
it_definitely met all my_expectations
personalized service
home_cooked authentic_food
i_always return home_from a_trip craving a_meal from my_own kitchen
tired of mass produced
restaurant food
the_owners parents are_the cooks
and_the home cooking really shines through
i_ordered_the_lamb rogannjosh with_garlic_naan
lamb_was fork tender
curry well_seasoned and containing bits_of fresh veggies chopped up
including sliced tomato
this curry_was made_with loving hands
not poured from_a jar
bravo
i_have_no doubt you'll enjoy your_meal if you stop_by
my_only regret was_that i_couldn't taste all_the unique curries offered
but_i_guess that's_just a_reason to_go_back
tummy growls
this_was_the_best and spiciest_curry i_found in_edinburgh
it_was also_had_the single best restaurant decor i_have_ever seen
the_place_is literally family_run and_they're some_of_the most hospitable and_friendly people_in_the world
i_went_on a_curry tour of_edinburgh while_i_was on holiday
i've_eaten curry_on three continents now_and
back_home
i_like_to get_my indian_take away_and add both habaneros and ghost pepper hot_sauce to_it before_i eat_it
curry
and especially spicy curry
is very_much an essential part_of my_life
so_i picked a_new_indian joint each night while_i_was in_the_city in_an attempt to_find it
the kismot killer wasn't available at_the_time i showed up but_i_was advised by_my waiter
one_of_the coolest
most welcoming guys i've ever met
it's so_spicy that it_takes away_from_the actual flavor_of_the curry
anyway
let's be_honest
there's_a point when spicy becomes less about flavor_and enjoyment than pure ego
so i_got_the next spiciest_curry on_the_menu vegetable naga and asked_for_it extra_spicy
with_rice_and chapati
the_food_was_excellent
the_dish
even without modification
was_actually a_fair amount spicy which
if_i can_taste a_bit_of spice
most_people probably shouldn't eat_it and the_flavors_were so vivid and_pleasant
i would've preferred it spicier by a_bit but_that's okay
it_was_still the spiciest_curry i_was_able_to find in_the_city and_definitely my_favourite
next_time i_go_to edinburgh i shall be visiting again
we_visited due_to_the excellent reviews_on trip advisor
we_were_not_disappointed
even our taxi driver had had_it recommended countless times via word_of mouth
service_was_excellent
lamb_was slow cooked_to_perfection naan_bread_was super
theonly let down was_that we_had_ordered from_the meduium section and the_curries_were not_at_all hot
they_were_very good_though
thank_you for_a delicious meal
we_will_definitely recommend_to our friends be_back next_time were in_edinburgh
great to_see_a family restaurant doing so_well
friendly
efficient service_was the icing in_the cake of_the_best lamb_saag i've ever_eaten
byob policy
no corkage charge what's not_to like
the_food_was_just ok_and kind of bland
we_have enjoyed indian_food around_the globe and neither the_food nor the_service impressed
it_was ramadan so_maybe that had_an effect
but after_all the_great_reviews
we_were disappointed
kismot is a_family_run restaurant that_has excellent food_and_service
they_do_not serve alcohol but have_no problem_with you bringing your_own
they_even remind you of_this when making_the booking
upon arrival
we_were warmly greeted_by_the son and_seated promptly
the_decor_is modern and_the_ambiance has_a lively feel
we_tried a_few_different curries
tarka dhal
and_the_garlic_naan
everything_was_delicious and_we_were stuffed beyond belief
i_cannot emphasize how great the_service_was here
they_make you_feel as_if you_were invited to_eat_at their home_with mum and dad cooking
wonderful place_and a_must_try
good_but_not as great as_others are saying
the_bad
the_naan simply wasn't very_good
i_am_used_to fresh
fluffy naan_with intense garlic flavour
these_were huge but rather flavourless and_a_bit chewy
the pilau_rice was_also fairly flavourless and disappointing
for the_mains
our tandoori_chicken_was okay but the_meat_was overcooked_and dry
the_good
our curry was_quite pleasant_and the_mango_lassi was_also_good
also no_complaints on_the service
verdict
perhaps we_had over inflated expectations
but_this_was simply a_decent indian_restaurant with nothing exceptional
i take_the sides
rice_and_naan
seriously and_they_were a let down
funky is_the_first word to_come to mind
the_place_is all pinks and purples and turquoises and dark tables
even the_water jugs are purple or turquoise
there's_a plasma screen showing a loop commercial for_their king of_curry thing that_they_do
with_their top media hits included
it's kind if distracting watching jack whitehall and james corden crying and drinking bowls_of yoghurt
but_it kind of fits with_the funky thing
if they_took out the_tables
chucked in a_couple_of lava lamps and cushions
and_maybe tiled one wall with tiny mosaic mirrors
it'd be_a cocktail bar nightclub
but_it's_a restaurant
and_it_is good_at being a_restaurant
the_food hit_the_spot perfectly
our vegetable_pakora onion bhajis were soft_and crispy
while my_chicken korma_was rich
creamy
plentiful and contained great big hunks of birdy goodness
the peshwari_naan don't quite reach the giddy heights of_those served_at skipton balti in yorkshire
nothing ever will
but they're easily the_closest i've_had
sweet_and flavoury
still totally a_word
they're lined with deliciousness
the_staff dealt with_our considerable party size expertly
even shuffling tables in_and_out to match our miscounted numbers with not_a rolled eye to_be seen or_a tut to_be heard
i_was_surprised there_was no water brought until we_asked
well after_the arrival of_the poppadums at_the start
but_it_was otherwise pretty flawless service too
it's_a_bit outr for my_tastes in terms_of decor but_it's damn fine food
y'all
as far_as listing what's good about_this_place goes
i_don't_know where to_start
recently opened on busy_and bustling nicolson street
in_delhi is perfect_for everything from meeting friends_for coffee
to a_full lunch
to simply wanting to_try_the mango cheesecake they advertise on_the blackboard outside
i_can_say_that much from personal experience
what i_love most about_this_place is_that_it stands out_from all_the_other lunch coffee places_in this_area of_edinburgh
the_walls and menus are covered with bollywood film covers
and_the seats and ceiling are covered with bright coloured
sequinned drapes and throws
whilst the bright colours might_not sound very relaxing
the seats are bean bag comfy and_the low tables give the_whole place an_authentic yet informal atmosphere
the_kitchen is_all open plan so_you_can see exactly how your_food is being prepared
i_usually_go for_the spicy_chicken roti wrap when_i'm there
which just_like the_veggie and_other meat rotis comes_with home_made salads
pickles and_chutneys which_are always different every_time you_go
for_those less predictable than me
the_counter is fit to burst with homemade pakoras
samosas_and bhajis of various descriptions and fillings
which again are_all served_with the_lovely sides
the infamous mango cheesecake
whilst not_as sweet as_usual cheesecakes
was_so more ish i_even thought about ordering a_second piece
no alcohol is_served
but_you couldn't ask_for_a bigger selection_of soft_drinks
ranging_from the_usual fizzy drinks you'd_expect to_the more exotic my_personal favourites are_the bundaberg ginger beer or_the rubicon mango juice
don't miss
if_you're_a student
take_your snapfax and_get discount on roti wraps and coffees
this cafe looks nothing on_the_outside like it_looks on_the_inside
which_is probably why it_took_me so_long to_get_to it
in delhi's on nicolson street
which_is_a pretty busy street
as far_as edinburgh's concerned
though it's no princes street
so_the bustle of_people always seemed_to keep_it well hidden
the_outside is white with scrawling letters
and_it_has two large windows that show a_whole bunch_of colourful drapes on the_walls
and similarly colourful pillows on_the seats
i can't_really decide whether it's tacky and overwhelming
or quite comforting
the pillows are_definitely comfortable
in_any case
they_serve a_variety_of indian_cuisine
as_well as lassis
juice
passion fruit
lychee and_more
delicious chai_and coffees
i_had_a desi coffee when_i_was there
which was_full_of cinnamon
always a_good_sign
the food's normally less_than_a fiver
and_you_get a_pretty_good
filling amount
around_the cafe
and inside the_bathroom there_are loads_of magazine photos of_indian stars and_they show music_videos on a_small tv
i definitely_recommend going in_for_a desi coffee
if you're a_fan_of cinnamon
and_a vanilla flavoured chai if you're around the_area and_want_to get away_from_the sirens and bustle of buses and cars on nicolson street
when_i first arrived in_edinburgh
this_place_had only been_open a_fresh six months
and you_could certainly tell by their low penetration pricing
for one_of_their delicious chicken rotis meals
one could_get away with paying
however
they've certainly gained popularity and increased the_prices along the_way
don't take_it the_wrong way
their still quite cheap
and thankfully now making_a profit on_their meals
but_i should still be allowed to grumble for the_old days
the rotis are cheaper
still coming with_a snap fax discount
as_well_as_a salad and_a_little side_of delicious stewed chickpeas
it's_also possible to_buy a_variety_of snacks at_the_counter
my_favourite being the_pakora
for_a more wholesome meal
they've got a_nice variety_of curries
and_i very_much recommend_you try_their desi chai_tea
which_is spiced
sweet indian tea which_has a tendency to make_me quite sleep each_time_i drink it
having eaten_at least fifteen roti's there
no joke
i_especially love_the charming and colourful indian d_cor
the constant bollywood movies playing on_the flatscreen tv
and the_indian celebrity magazines they've got on hand for waiting customers
to_in_delhi is_a_great little_indian coffee shop in_the newington area_of edinburgh
it_is really cosy inside
with a_small seating_area covered_in brightly covered drapes and_indian music_playing in_the_background very authentically indian
although_it is_quite small inside it_could very easily feel cramped
but they_have decorated it_in such_a way that it_feels cosy and intimate
there_is_a small counter at the_back_of_the shop selling traditional indian_food_as well_as hot_and chilled drinks
to_in_delhi use authentic_indian terms on_their_menu when listing the_food
they_have_a range_of dishes available such_as pakora's and samosas_and there_is_an impressive selection_of_vegetarian meals available too
the_staff_are warm adn inviting and willing to_explain what_a particular dish_is
to_in_delhi is_a_great_place_to sit_in or takeaway food to_get_a little taste_of_india
to_in_delhi has_a pretty_cool name
and_that_was part_of_the reason why my mate and_i first went inside
the_interior decor feels stylish and cosy with_plenty_of pictures and ornaments to_make you_feel_like you've stepped into india
the menu_is_extensive
with_plenty_of authentic_indian dishes
only some_of which_i had actually heard_of before
i_went_for_the tandoori lamb kebabs which were_delicious
spicy_and served_with really_fresh salad
it came_in a_nice
big portion and cost only about
the_service_is_friendly and_efficient
making to_in_delhi well_worth a_look if_you're_in_the area
stepping in_here and you_feel_like you've stepped into another world
they have_gone all out_with the_indian decor jewel coloured drapes cover the_walls and cosy cushions fill the seats
it smells incredible in_here as_well which immediately got_my tastebuds excited
and they_weren't disappointed
the_long menu means that you_are bound to_find something you fancy
i didnt know what a_lot_of_the stuff on_the_menu was
but_that just adds to_the fun and if_you_ask the_staff for suggestions they_don't look_at you_and laugh but explain patiently what the_dishes_are
i_was_very pleasantly suprised by the_prices which_has made this a_regular haunt for_me for_a full meal or_just a coffee or cold drink
deceptively plain looking on_the_outside
step into in_delhi and_you'll be transported to_india
the_interior_is decked out_in multi coloured cushions and drapes and scarves
which make you_feel_like an_extra in_a bollywood film
this_is added_to by the_fact they_actually have bollywood films playing in_the_background
sometimes a_slight distraction but_good fun nonetheless
also if_you_want_to brush up_on your hindi they_have indian books that_you_can have_a nose in
the_food_itself is_excellent and refreshingly different_from most other_places in_edinburgh
it is_a_great mix of_indian_and snacky food
like_a more low key mother_india caf
they_do excellent curries which can_be put into_a wrap
the roti wraps
definitely the_highlight_of the caf
but_there_are also loads_of other indian_style nibbles to_try
these wraps
despite being reasonably_priced to_start_with
are off_with_a snapfax
they_also have an_excellent range_of hot_and cold drinks
including the_chai
which_is amazing
this comes_with_a free little biscuity cakey type thingy which
although_i am generally not_a_fan_of cakes
was_pretty_good
the_staff here_are lovely and_it_is generally pretty cheap so definitely drop in for_a_great alternative_to the_standard sandwich bars that litter edinburgh
authentic chai
in_edinburgh
at last
this_little place_is gorgeous
and smacks of_india with_its bollywood movies in_the_background and chai simmering away on_the stove
service_is_good
there_is probably a_little room_for improvement in display and presentation of_the deli section
but_nothing that_will put you_off
it's the_kind_of place i_want_to return_to with a_book and order_a never ending pot of chai
lovely
nice
the flatmate and_i ducked in_for_a bite this past friday_night
after recommendations from yelp
it's listed as_a tea house within the_restaurant section and until i_got in it_didn't realise that it_really was_just_a tea house that_did food_and not_a restaurant_that does tea
saying
just_a tea house
is_really selling it short
though
for we_got mixed plate_of tons_of starters
salad
curries_and drinks
it said_it included_a slice of cake or indian sweets which we_weren't offered but to_be_honest
we_would_have struggled to fit dessert in anyway
as_for_the place itself
it's cosy and_really decked out like_an_indian tea tent
the_bollywood movies are highly entertaining but_the bhangra music can_get_a bit much
not_enough to_stop me going back
though
what can i say_about delhi that hasn't already been said
it's_really lovely
gorgeous
cozy decor bright hangings
comfy pillows thrown about
would really warm up_a windy edinburgh afternoon
delicious_food tried the_lamb samosas and_chicken_tikka_masala and_they_were both great
generous portions as_well and_the_prices so sinfully low
i_felt a_bit criminal
like_i_was robbing the_place
the_service is_very_friendly_and courteous_and there's a_great_selection_of teas
it'd be a_lovely place_to while away a rainy afternoon
sipping on tea_and nibbling on poppadoms if_you_can get_a_table
it_gets quite busy
and rightfully so
indian nom nom nom
so as_a friend_and_i completed our awesome fancy dress outfits we decided_that we_needed some_food to reward our efforts
we_had_been admiring the_mosque_kitchen and thinking of giving it_a_go
my amigo pointed out a_very true thing
it doesnt look very_authentic
it_looks_like any cafe restaurant_that could_be serving anything so on we_went
we_saw dehli and inspected the_menu
cheap we_thought and_with him being a_student on we_went inside
as you_go inside your eyes and_other senses are assaulted
the vibrant decor
the_smell_of the_food
the_music and the_bollywood madness on_the screen transport you to_another world away_from_the bustling world outside
one_thing we_did notice immedietrly was_the high number_of indian customers
there is_a_lot to_be said we agreed for a_restaurant if its_a palce where_the people_of said country cuisine go to_dine there
you kind of think
yeah
this is_going_to_be good
after reviewing the_menu we_opted_for the
sharing platter
after_a reasonable wait we_were_not_disappointed
what appeared before us was_a rorating platter with different_dishes
lovely fragrant rice
chipati and naans
chickpea_curry
spinach_and potato dish
alak gook perhaps im not_good with names
chicken_masala
badjis with cous cous and salad with yogurt_sauce
also included for_this price were_a juice
i_had gauva juice
so damn goood
also included was_a desert to_share which_was_a mango cheesecake
the base wasa very buttery shortcake
with_a cream rich cake with pieces_of mango through it topped and decorated with passionfruit
raspberry and_mango purees
amaaaaazing
jd hugely happy man will_be_back here for_sure
if to_in_delhi were_a white walled
standard caf it wouldn't_be getting as high a rating
but_it's_not
it_is_a gorgeous
small yet overwhelming little cave of_a caf covered_in floor to ceiling with throws
occasinoal wafts of incense floating across the_smell_of curry_and cutting through the_bollywood tunes
whilst my_date was_excited at_the thought of actually sitting on_the_floor to_eat
apparently partial to_it
we_weren't quite there
but_the seats are low and cushy and comfy so it_definitely lends itself to relaxed caf culture than restaurant
but_then you_order a_huge plate_of curry for_lunch_and wonder how you_could justify this on_a weekly basis
i_mean
you_can't say you couldn't afford it considering it_only costs for a_plate_of steaming
fresh curry
for_their student deals
seriously
and_if_you don't_want curry there_are cakes and_amazing sounding coffees
mango cheesecake with_an amaretto coffee
yes please
it_is just
magical
which kind of overshadowed the_fact my_curry was_only so_so
i_ordered_the daily special of lamb_curry
presentation definitely lacking
see photo
but_hey curry isn't exactly going for_those brownie points anyway
a_bit sloppy
a_lot_of sauce
the 'steamed' turret of rice_that goes a_bit chewy quite quickly
very very_small side salad
the_lamb was_nice_and tender
but there_wasn't much_of it
and the_curry_was strangely not_spicy
at_all
my_date agreed her veggie curry was_also not_spicy
not_even mild
just no_spice
it's_hard_to say what the_taste_was as usually there_is some form_of obvious spice
even mustard
cutting through mild curries
so_for the_food_itself
i_would_not rush back
the cheesecake maybe
but_if_you_are short_of pennies and want_a very_filling meal
in quite magical surroundings you won't find anywhere else in_edinburgh
then to_in_delhi in_the_place
i_think_it might_be_a case of they_do some_things really_well
their_chai lattes and cheesecakes
and_it's good_value and it's_really kitschy and put together
but for_a foodie like_me
i_know i could_get something far more flavoursome for only_a_few pound more
still
it_was_perfect for_a lunchtime date
in dehli
by no means
the freshest
or tastiest curry you_will_have in_edinburgh
but_it's cheap_and fast_and friendly
the_pakoras were_a_little chewy
the_curries_were a_little greasy
the breads were cut up too thin
why oh why did someone take time to_make something less useful
but god damn i_got_a big tasty plate of_food_for i_can't think_of many_other places_that would do the_same
and_a can of diet coke was_a pound
i'm so_glad that's how_they roll
i_hate it_when places charge you
for wee glass_of draught pepsi
or a_wee bottle_of coke
to sum up
not_the finest
but you'll struggle to_find better value
my_go_to place when_i_am hungry
on_a budget
but craving something tasty_and worth more than_what_i paid
i_always_get their_chicken masala_which seems to_be_a very popular dish here
which says a_lot about_how it_tastes
they_also have tasty options_for vegetarians
my vegetarian roommate loves it_here
for_dessert
i_always_get their_mango cheesecake
which
i'm salivating now just thinking_about_it
it's wonderful
if_you_go here
you_must get the_mango cheesecake
the_decor_is beautiful as_well
with colorful drapes covering every square inch of the_walls
i_wish_they had a_larger selection_of dishes
but the_selection they_do_have is_tasty
if you're craving indian_cuisine
want somewhere cozy to relax while_eating
and_you have_only pounds in_your pocket
this_is_the_place
a quirky and effeminate little_indian cafe to_in_delhi is_almost ideal for_the lunchtime curry craving
almost
offering_a basic selection_of curries at good_value
it_feels a_bit mean to point_out the_curries themselves are very_mild
obviously this_is to_cater_to the widest audience possible but_it left_me craving another
spicier
curry
the_decor_is much_as early holywood pictured a sultan's harem
the smells are at least in part from incense
at_a guess nag champa
all in_all for_me_to in_delhi is trying too hard
the_service_was_friendly and_efficient
but based_on_the food and_the_fact i_wasn't as enamoured by the_decor as_some
i find_this_place simply ok
this_is_probably the_main competitor of the_mosque_kitchen
serving cheap curry to hungry people
i_would much rather eat_here though
to succeeds in creating that tranquil hippy atmosphere
the_interior_is quite_a world away_from_the freezer outside
bollywood music
incense and colourful cushions and fabrics give_the illusion that you're_in some chai tent at glastonbury festival
that's a_good_thing
by the_way
whilst the_mosque_kitchen delivers vast quantities of food_in_a canteen like set_up
here you_get table_service
a_menu
and somewhere comfortable to_sit
sure
the_menu_is limited
but_it's_not really that_bad
you_are_not going to_find_a cheaper meal anywhere lentil dahl and rice_or naan_for
it_comes_with a_little salad_and some couscous
which_is a_nice_touch
considering how inexpensive it_is
i_also ask_for extra spice with the_lentil dahl
as without_it
it_can_be a_little_on_the mild side
probably safer if_they_are making bulk quantities of one_dish
as some_people hate spice
i_have also_had_the chickpeas a_few_times
and_my_boyfriend has tried the_paneer
you_can tell everything has_been microwaved through
yet it_was originally homemade
and_this_is the likely reality of most_indian_restaurants
you_would be waiting a_lot longer if you really_wanted them to_make_it from scratch especially for_you
and you'd be paying more
the_chai and_mango cheesecake here also look interesting
though_i haven't actually tried them so can't comment
the_service_here is_very_friendly
but_not in your_face
which_is quite refreshing
i_go_to the delhi cafe about once_a_week i_can't resist
i_love everything about_it
apart from_the toilet facilities
the_food_is cheap_and delicious
the_curry is_very flavourful
the_naan_bread just_the_right_amount_of garlicky
the_rice_is lovely_and a refreshing little side_of fresh salad_and couscous comes on your_plate
portions_are the_perfect size
enough_to not_make you_feel_like you'd want more
but_not so_much_that it's_a struggle
yummy
comforting food that_doesn't leave you feeling over stuffed
the_staff_are lovely as_well
very efficient and up_for a_wee chat
what more could you_want
love_it
i'd give_it stars_if they_gave the toilet a_bit_of_a re furb
this_is_probably my_favorite_restaurant in_edinburgh
the_atmosphere
consistent quality
low prices
and_delicious options make_this my_go_to place_when friends come_to visit or when_i'm just_not in_the_mood to_cook
you_really can't beat for excellent curry_in a cozy restaurant
and_it's great_for students
as_it's a_minute walk_from the_main campus

really_tasty and cheap
lot_of choice and_delicious mango cheesecake
vraiment bon et pas cher
beaucoup de choix et un cheesecake la mangue d licieux
i_can not rave about_this golden gem enough after eating_here days out_of_a day visit_to edinburgh
food
everything you_expect plus more
perfect_amount of_flavor
spice
and portions
started_with_the vegetable_samosa which ended up being extremely filling as it_comes with_a_side_of chickpeas
small salad
and scoop_of cous cous
more than_i_expected that on_my second_visit i_ordered_the same
added a_side_of_rice and called it a_meal
during my_first_visit i_also_had the_lentils and_rice
i'm_used_to ordering yellow lentils but found their red lentils more pur ed than solid
but_still flavorful
second and third visit consisted_of enjoyed_their cheesecakes
just get_it
trust_me
service
treated me like we've know each_other for_years
i_definitely didn't_feel like_a visitor and_of_course contributed to_the many reasons why_i returned
i_was informed after my_meal they_only accepted cash
after feeling embarrassed
their trust allowed for_me_to disappear for_a_while while searching_for cash
they greeted me back_with a_smile
that's where strangers became best friends
affordability
a
tips
chat it up_with_the staff
cash only
go_back again
and_again
and_again
incredibly cheap_and good with_a_nice atmosphere
i_even took_my in laws here_when they_were visiting
i_had_a very enjoyable lunch_at mother_india last weekend
the_idea_of tapas_style indian_food_is very appealing as_you get_to_try a_whole variety_of_dishes rather than_just a_couple_of main_courses
we split our choices between vegetable sand meat
a crispy chilli_chicken dosa
standard chicken_curry
mushroom bhaji and okra and_potatoes
unlike some asain restaurants they_didn't seem afraid_to put a_bit_of_a spice kick into their_food which_was appreciated
as another reviewer points out
you'll need at_least_one portion_of rice per_person as_they are_quite small_but the_great thijng about_the tapas_style is you_can keep ordering until you've had your fill
service_was_very_friendly and_food delivered promptly
i'd have_no hesitation about_a return_visit
mother_india had long been considered one_of_the best_places to_get_a curry_in glasgow
so_the decision to_open a branch in_edinburgh was a_good_one
when_the cafe opened in_edinburgh in_the locals breathed a collective sigh of relief
finally an establishment had opened that put a_new perspective on_indian_food
the_menu advises that_you order_to dishes per_person and_share everything tapas_style
my_favourite thing_about going out_for a_curry is sampling what everyone else has ordered
and_that's exactly what mother_india has capitalised upon
everything_is cooked to_order and_brought to_your_table as_soon as_it's ready
when dining_with a_large_group of_people
you easily forget how_much you've ordered_and the_dishes just seem_to keep on coming
which_is no bad_thing given how delicious it_all is
highlights on_the_menu include the spiced haddock
which_is cooked_to_perfection in tinfoil
and_the_butter_chicken
a heavenly concoction that tastes so_good it_must be_very very_bad for_you
the_food_here_is tasty
the_prices_are cheap and_the_atmosphere_is convivial just make_sure_you come with_a_few friends
so_you_can sample as many_dishes as possible
a_friend told_me i_should go_and try_this_place
presumably because_he was_so sick of_me banging on about in_delhi just up the_road from_here
maybe_i didn't go_in with_an open mind
but i_have_to_say there_was nothing particularly special about_this_place
yes
they_do an_amazing selection_of spiced
herbal or green teas
and_yes the nibbles sized dishes_on_the food menu were_tasty
the mushroom poori and chilli_chicken dosa in particular
i_thought_the whole place lacked a_bit_of character that so_many other_indian eateries have
the furniture d_cor was_very formal and serious
which_is pretty much the_opposite of_what a_restaurant with_a tapas mentality should be in_my_opinion i_loved how we_were constantly dipping into eachother's dishes sampling sharing them_all
but sitting at those tables i_felt as though_i was_doing something_i shouldn't be every_time_i did
an indian_style tapas restaurant_which although quite new is_very popular with_the locals
i_really_like this_place_just because_i can_order a_selection_of indian_foods and_try a_bit_of_a variety
however
if_it's crowded
which_is usually is
it_gets very noisy
as_the sound seems_to bounce of_the walls_and celling
our_waiter_was good
although if_you_have_a small tolerance for very_hot stuff do_not go with_their suggestions of medium our was charmingly tearing up during my_date
so pretty with makeup down_my cheeks yes
on friday's and_saturday evenings book in_advance
it's reasonably_priced as far_as edinburgh restaurants as_well
i_was_really_excited about visiting mother_india in_edinburgh
considering_the repute of mother_india in glasgow and_the established knowledge that_the group's food_has blown_away a_lot_of_people
not least the competition
the_restaurant_has_a cute little premises on infirmary street
small
but perfectly formed and set around two levels
and_with_a good bit_of room on_the downstairs floor too
i_appreciate the_idea_of indian tapas is_quite a novel one
or it certainly seems_to be something you_don't encounter often
being a_big_fan_of tapas and spanish food
i_do understand the attraction of having little snack size portions_of quite a_few_dishes
and_not limiting yourself to the_one variety
which normally i_would firmly approve of
considering my indecisive nature and_food jealousy tendencies when other_people are presented with_their meal
as tasty_as all_the food_here_was
i_found_the tapas aspect a_bit too_much_for me
with_my palate unable to cope with the_amount_of different spices_and indian taste sensations it_was being bombarded with
perhaps i'm_just inexperienced in_this field
and need_to give tapas indian_style more_of_a chance
but_for now i'm sticking with my_main indian_dish
rice
and_naan
feel free to_call this boring
but it_seems i'm old fashioned and stuck in_my ways when_it_comes_to certain types_of food
mother_india is_something different
although at_the_time i didnt realsise there_was_a mother_india in glasgow
when_i_was here recently
i_knew_i had found something a_bit special
set aside in a_tiny fronted building
inside mother_india spans two floors and_is a_lovely mixture or traditional and_more modern concepts when_it_comes_to the_decor
it's actually rather pleasing on_the eye
and if_i were_able_to bring a_few scatter cushions and_a bean bag
i_would_have a_perfect chill out space
anyway
the_food_here_is something different its kind of like_the bastard love child of spain and india a_selection_of tiny portions designed to_be eaten tapas_style
but from a_very indian menu
the_concept actually work very_well the_food_is_not only excellent
but by ordering lots_of dishes everybody gets a taste_of what_they fancy without suffering from food envy
there_is
depending on_what combination_of food you_order
a overpowering sense_of flavour which may be unpleasent to_some peoples tastes
however
anything_that manages to_put a_modern spin on_indian_food is_good with_me
it_also helps that i_love tapas
so
yay
i'm_a_fan
i_first noticed mother india's cafe when sitting_in cafe nero across the_road
looking out
it_looked interesting so_i_had to_try_it
this_indian_restaurant certainly is_a_bit different
as_the others_have suggested
it_isn't just another takeaway or indian_buffet house
but_a tapas_style restaurant where you_can sample many_dishes
in_this respect mother india's cafe earns points for_being different
i_did enjoy_the_food here_at mother india's cafe but_i more enjoyed_the tea
the_latter was_quite exciting
the former
for_all its ingenuity
wasn't_as great as_i_had hoped
i_also have_to agree_with fiona about_the setting
inside it_is rather too bland_and formal and i_didn't_feel overly relaxed
at the_same_time the_waiter was_very_friendly_and the pricing was_average
not_a_bad indian_restaurant with_a novel idea
but_it could_do with improving its atmosphere
my_first trip to_this_restaurant was_a snap decision
one i'm extremely happy about
the_moment i realized it serves indian_food
tapas_style
i_had a_little_bit_of an epiphany
sure they'd obviously already come up_with_the idea
but_i_still felt it_was incredibly genius and_worth having an epiphany over any how
and_yes
the_food did rock my world
for_the small amounts that each meal comes_in
this_is_my only_complaint
more please
there's a_lot_of quality packed in
i_had_a wonderful chicken_curry_with nuts
giggle
spicy prawns
some pakoras which_were surprisingly spicy_and my_one and_only love
peshwari_naan
i_didn't_feel incredibly full after the_meal
which_was less than after splitting the_bill
it's probably not_great to_be rolling out_of_the restaurant
but_the glutton in me feels it's only right if you're paying for_the_food
it's incredibly busy
and_there_was a_minute wait_for_a_table
i triply recommend_it
i_was_a_bit leery of paying
tapas plate prices
for_indian_food
but_this_was delicious_and worth_the small premium
we_did pay a_wee bit_more than_we would've for_a more traditional_indian menu
the_aubergine
eggplant
fritters were_amazing
the_samosas_were some_of_the best we've_had
and_the_chicken_tikka mahkni sauce_was creamy
rich_and the_perfect blend_of spicy sweet
mother india's was my_first_experience of non british indian_food
you_know_what i_mean
indian is_indian
but us brits have_a way_of doing it_that makes_it distinctly british indian
creamy kormas
and don't_forget the_vindaloo
don't_get_me_wrong
this sort of_indian is_nice
but it's_all a_little repetitive
mother india's cafe serve up far more authentic_indian_food
in tapas_style portions
which_means you_can_order or different_dishes to_share in_all_the flavours_and textures
and_this can_only be a_good_thing
the_curries_are absolutely_delicious
and_a million miles away_from_the standard
chicken_tikka_masala
my_personal favourites are the_aubergine and_potato curry
channa dahl
ginger and chilli_chicken
lamb pasanda
in_fact it's_all pretty damned good
they also_do a_takeaway service
although no delivery
and_it's something_i make use_of frequently
rather handily with_the takeaway you_can_order a 'large' portion which_is bigger than_the tapas portions you_get with sitin
i've_only done takeaway from_here so_far
and everytime the food_has_been hot
hot
hot
both tasty hot
spicy hot
and sexy hot
yep you heard me
my_only recommendation
try_it
when_i heard it_was_a tapas_style indian_restaurant it_almost put me_off but_i_am soo glad_i went
great_food
quick_service and sensible price do_not miss
i_was_here this afternoon for_lunch
service_is_very prompt
which_i appreciate
the_wall coverings are lovely
and lend the_place a_very upscale image
foodwise
myself and_a friend_ordered dishes
rice
and garlic_naan_bread
bill total
not_bad
considering we walked away pleasantly full
the_spicy chili king prawns were_delicious
unfortunately there were_only prawns
and_potato
definitely_worth it_though
the mushrooms on_a flake puff pastry was good_as_well
more so for_the pastry than_the mushrooms
tikka chicken_was well_cooked
and_came with_an abundance of onions_and peppers
the_thing with_lamb and_spinach was_delicious as_well
and_was our only dish that_came_with some_sort_of
gravy
with which_we could_eat our naan_bread
overall
a_very_good experience
i_really_liked_the wallpapers that they_used
it_felt very chic
but the_price tag wasn't super ridiculous
recently went_to mother_india with_my gang of_friends
a_friend_of_mine thrown a_party for_his new job
there is_always_a reason to_celebrate
we_were people and_i_have something in_mind to_order as_all other guys were no_idea about_what to_eat
it_is_a tapas_style and not_bad
spicy hot
good ambience
calm
relaxed
no problem to_get_the table
the staffs are_friendly
we_ordered nans
kebabs
butter_chicken
patina lamb
chicken_tikka makhani
butter_chicken particular was so_tasty
wow
yes
we_were so hungry
offcourse some pints
it_was_about pounds and not_bad
i find_some this cafe particularly authentic in thier indian stuffs
btw its_a tapas_style so_you_can order other_dishes too
all together it_was_a_nice time
and_yes
will visit_again
checked this out last_night as i_had_a frined to_meet in_edinburgh
as_good_as_it gets to_be_honest with regard to quality_of_food and authenticity of_flavors
traditional
yet
complex
a_tapas lover's
indian delight
i_came_to mother_india a_few_weeks_ago with a_bunch_of friends_who frequent this_place often
we_had_a table booked for pm on_a_saturday_night
we_walked_in and_it_was like_a party
in the_best way possible
it smelled amazing in_the_restaurant so_i_was very_excited
there_were six of_us so we_ordered_a variety_of_dishes
it's tapas_style so we_shared everything
the food_arrived almost immediately which_was great for_us
a stand_out dish_for me_was_the prawns grilled in_a chilli sauce
our_server_was very_kind and_helpful
i_think_that this_would_be_a great date spot
some colleagues from work often order_the takeaway on_a_friday_night they_do larger portions for_this
however
one_thing to note is that_i_didn't find the_food_to_be particularly spicy
this can_be a_good_thing if_you_have_a less spicy palette
i'm definitely a_fan and will_be_back
indian tapas is most certainly a_new concept
and works quite well for small appetites
or those who want_to try a_bit_of everything
each mini dish costs between
and whilst a_small plate would_probably suffice for_me for_lunch
others may need two three a head
i_come_here quite often with my_parents
and usually_get some poppadoms with chutney
a_vegetarian dosa_which comes_with_a fresh little salad
and something to_share with my_boyfriend
which_is usually saag panner
indian cheese which doesn't melt
is white
and cubes_of it are cooked into sauces
or_a mushroom dish_which i_don't remember_the_name_of
we_usually have_a rice dish on_the_table too
the_only naan i_tried here_was peshwari
and_it_was_very sweet
stuffed_with raisins_and grated coconut
it_was_delicious
though to_me more_of_a pudding snack
there_are quite a_few veggie_options
which_is good for_me
my_dad and_my_boyfriend
but_my mum who eats fish was equally satisfied_with her choices
there also a_few specials everyday
i_think_they could_do with_more indian pudding options though
whilst they sell very_good pistachio ice_cream
it's_just_not kulfi
mother_india is conveniently located near_the national museum of scotland and the_university of_edinburgh
across the_road from blackwells book shop
i'd passed by this_place_so many_times but hadn't taken too_much notice
but_when a_friend suggested going i_was_happy to_try_out a new_place and_i_love tapas
i really_enjoyed_the_food
there seemed_to be a_wide_selection of_food_and the_price_was reasonable too
we probably ordered too_much_food
we each ordered tapas to_share among six of_us as_well as rice_and_naan bread
but_we gave_it_a good go of_eating as_much as we_could
they_did forget two_dishes and_i did remind them of one_dish
as_i really_wanted to_try_it
and_they brought_it straight away so it_wasn't an_issue
the_food_was fab
service_was_good_and the food_arrived quickly enough
i_would_definitely_go back
this_is_the_only place in_edinburgh which reaches my_expectations of home_cooked food_in_the sub continent
the_place_is very_friendly
the_staff_is helpful_and food_is mesmerizing
i_can not_really criticize anything about_this_place
it_is also relatively cheaper to a_lot_of nasty take away's in_edinburgh
the_only_thing_i am confused about is how is this_place cheap_and nice at the_same_time
got to_be_a high five for mother_india
myself and_a_few old workmates having all four_of us gone our separate ways from_the citi arena now congregate monthly for a_tuesday curry club
the_idea was to_try_a different place every month
we've been_going for_two months now
this_place both_times
now i'm worried we may never see another_indian_restaurant
but_in fairness if going_to mother_india once a_month is_a worry
i_don't_know_what i'm smoking
it's tremendous
setting itself up as an_indian tapas deal
meaning you get_to_try a_bunch_of dishes_at the_same_time
as opposed_to the_standard sit down affair offered by other_restaurants en masse
good thing_about tuesday curry club
besides the_curry
is_that_it consists of growing boys with healthy appetites
with so_much on_offer
it means we_can get_away with ordering_a ridiculous amount_of_food
and with_the tapas_style we can_order even_more if_we feel we've under supplied ourselves
what did we_have
what did we_have
there_was
lamb karahi
chilli garlic chicken
chilli_chicken dosa
baby aubergine and_potatoes
vegetable_pakora
chicken_breast curry
chilli king prawns
so_good we_ordered portions
mutton curry
daily special
of_which there_are
daily
peshwari_naan
garlic_naan
paratha
rice
we_had so_much_food we_couldn't see the_table
we_had so_much_food we_had_to admit defeat
leaving some pakora_and aubergine to_be returned while_we hung our heads in shame
considering we_got all_the above plus soft_drinks for_a head
people
of_us_had to_work late sadly
shows what_a bargain mother_india is
always busy so book ahead
staff_are delightful
chatty and_happy to_leave you to_it once your food's down
a_must_try for lovers of_indian_cuisine
tuesday curry club
december location
you guessed it
indian tapas is the_future
we followed the_menu advice and_ordered or dishes between and_naan rice
the_food_was reasonably_priced at_around per dish_and it_was_great being able to_try_new dishes
i'd_recommend trying the_delicious ice_cream also if_you_can leave room_for it
definitely worth_a_visit
oh mama
what morselesque deliciousness
complex spice combinations made each of_the_dishes distinctive
the_creamy lamb stew
the cilantro chicken
the baby eggplant with_potatoes
the spiced halibut
they_were_all delicious in_their very own way
together with a_bottle_of
dry
not sweet
cooled ros wine
this_was_a perfect meal
each_dish left behind a lingering
full bodied aftertaste
that
not_much unlike old bordeaux
made you close your eyes to enable full concentration on_this sensory encounter of_the_indian kind
besides this short lasting anti social effect
the tapas_style food gives rise to a_very communal experience
and_the_place thus pulsates in_a lively atmosphere
thus
mother_india is_a_good idea for romantic t te t tes
as the_night already starts off in_a_very sensual and interactive manner
definitely worth_a_visit if_you're_in edinburgh
the_butter_chicken wasn't my_favorite but_still_good
i_would choose a_different chicken_dish next_time though
the vegetable_pakoras and_saag_paneer were_both delicious
the_saag_paneer was_spicy but_nothing overwhelming
it_had the perfect_amount if heat
for good_indian_food_in edinburgh this is_the_place_to_go
of_us came_to the mother india's cafe for_a well needed after work feed
i_was_quite intrigued about a_tapas small plate style indian_restaurant
being one_of_my_favorite cuisines i_had_been really looking_forward_to it all_day
and it_didn't disappoint
the_restaurant looks_like_a cafe from outside
in_fact
if there_wasn't the_amazing smell_of indian_food coming_from the_place
you'd be forgiven for thinking it_was_a coffee shop
the_decor inside is_a_little basic but it_looks nice_and it works really_well
between us we_ordered dishes_and rice
the stand_out dishes for_me were_the methi keema mutter which_was_delicious minces lamb with_peas
and aloo_gobi with green beans
advertised as small plates
i_expected small plates
but_they_were a_really decent size
there_was a_little_bit left in a_few_of our bowls plates as we_were_all completely full
mother india's cafe do_have some traditional curry_dishes on_the_menu
but_this isn't_a tradition 'british' curry_house
it_is_a brilliant adaptation of_indian_cuisine
while the_location of voujon is slightly off_the beaten track
i_would thoroughly recommend the_restaurant to_anyone_looking_for quality indian_cuisine
the waiters_were immensely patient with_our large_party
service_was_excellent
and_this_was matched by_the high_quality food_and wide range_of dishes available
very_good value_for_money too
voujon prides itself with modern
ish
indian_and bengali food to_the extent where it_has positive_reviews in_its restaurant window from various local papers or diners who_has testified
dont let these fool_you though
voujon isnt as great_as it claims
the 'modern' cooking is uninspiring
and totally lacking the flavours that traditional_indian food_would deliver in_an instant
this pretty much described the dissapointment we_felt for the_whole meal lacking that certain something
the punch as_it were
the_food generally tasted like something you_could buy from_a supermarket
but_was way_more expensive
however
voujon has_some redeeming features the_restaurant_is beautifully modern_and elegant and the_staff_were helpful
overall
voujon was_a dissapointment and_i doubt voujon will post this_review in_its window
i_went_to the bengali and indian_restaurant voujon for_the_first_time a_few_weeks_ago and_since then i_have_been back twice
they_serve traditional and_authentic indian_dishes which_are full_of_flavour
i_have_had a_few_of their curry_dishes and my_favourite is_the king prawn bhuna which_is very_tasty_and quite spicy_but_not too_much that_it ruins your_meal
the_dishes at voujon are_all very_well presented and_the foo is reasonably_priced
with main meals around and_there_is an_extensive veggie menu available as_well
they_offer several different_types_of rice and_there_is plenty of variety_of side_dishes to accompany your_meal
the_decor inside_is very_authentic and_modern whilst the_staff have always_been very_attentive_and warm
voujon also_do takeaways and_is available_for private functions
this_place promises a_lot
apart from anything else it's refreshing to_find an_indian resturant close_to_the city centre which_isn't full_of rowdy groups lured in by_the cheap food_and bring_your_own bottle policy
unfortunately
it_doesn't quite deliver everything it promises
there's no denying that_the d_cor is_beautiful the solid oak furniture and linen tablecloths certainly give the_place an upmarket feel
but_when main_courses are around without any rice_or naans you_would_expect something more from_the food_than it actually delivers
that_said
they_offer_a handful_of set banquets for_two_people which work out at roughly per head including starters right through to main_courses
although my_friends that_i ate_there with said_that theirs was_pretty bland_and dull
i wouldn't_go as far_as saying it_was a_bad_meal
but i_haven't_been in_a mad rush to_go_back to voujon since my_first_visit
i_came_to voujon with_my flatmates a_few_months ago_and
whilst the_service_and atmosphere were_excellent
the_food_wasn't quite up_to_the same standard as_some other_indian_restaurants in_the_area
the_decor feels modern
fresh and_clean with_plenty_of neatly laid out tables and_really comfortable seats
the_staff_are attentive
friendly_and know everything about the_menu which always helps when_you have_no_idea what_to_expect from_a certain dish
i_went_for_the tandoori_chicken kebabs with_rice which didn't take long to_arrive
but tasted_a litle dry
the_salad it_was served_with was_fresh_and there_were_some great flavours going_on
yet it_was_just lacking some sauce
i'd probably come_to voujon agai
but_i_just expected a_little_more from the_food
reasonably good_curry
although not_as_good_as the_reviews_on the_window claim
i_agree_with the_other_reviews that_it promises more_than it_really delivers
can't disagree more with most_of_the other_reviews
i_have_been a_regular here_for_a good few years now_and rate it_as one_of_the_best_indian restaurants_in_edinburgh
food_is_always great
value excellent and_staff fantastic
i_have_tried a_lot_of_the other_indian_restaurants
highly rated on_yelp
and_found none to_be_a patch on voujon
tasty curry with_plenty_of options to_choose_from
attentive_staff
and_a relaxed atmosphere
great option if_you_are inbthe arwa and are_looking_for great curry
if ever i_feel the need for_a take away
and_i want to_make_a feast out_of it
this_is where_i come
the_reason is simple
the_food_here_is great
and_the_portions_are massive
a huge_menu of_curries
indian_dishes and kebabs are on_offer at chilli connestion as_well as_all the_side orders and starters you_could ever want
the_food_is spiced to_perfection
the sauces_are flavoursome and_rich with_plenty_of meat_in them
the naan_breads are huuuuuge
and are_always soft_and perfectly_cooked
chilli_connection has a_quick delivery service
which you_can_order online for or ring up_for
my_only criticsm of chilli_connection is sometimes the_service in the_actual shop is poor
but for_the_amount_of time_you spend in_there
this_is nothing
chilli_connection offers great indian_takeaway food at_reasonable_prices considering the_size_of the_portions
the_selection_of curries is plentiful with just_about any meat served_in balti
dhansk
masala_or virtually any_other conceivable spices combination
on_top_of this they_serve a_selection_of naan_breads
kebabs and rices to really quell your hunger
the_first_time_i visited_this curry_house was_just prior_to a night_out when my_friends_and_i reckoned some spicy_food would set us right_up for_a night on_the tiles
i_ordered_the spicy chicken_wings with chilli sauce_and when they_said 'spicy' they meant spicy
one mouthful in_and i_had_the full works watery eyes
runny nose and my_mouth felt like_a firework had_just exploded in_it
the surprising thing_was that it_still tasted amazing
there_was genuine flavour as opposed_to just raw heat_and spice which can_only be_a sign_of quality cooking
i_would certainly recommend chilli_connection in_terms of_flavour and value
if_you_ask any university of_edinburgh student who_has lived_in newington where a_great takeaway is
chilli_connection will almost certainly_be the answer
it_seems_to have_gone down in folklore as_the place_to_get curry
kebabs or pizzas in_that part_of_town
this reputation is helped by the_location
on south clerk street
this_is right on_the route most students staying at pollock halls of residence
near holyrood park
will_take home_from a night_out
you_can quite easily fall into chilli_connection
and come_out minutes later with_some wholesome takeaway goodness
let's be_honest the_food_is nothing_to_write_home about
it's fairly unremarkable takeaway quality_food
it_is_the location of_this_place that makes_it worthy of four_stars
having sampled one_of_the their pizzas at_some unearthly hour in_the morning
it_very_much hit_the_spot
as anything would have_done at_the that time
prices_are_reasonable
and_service_is ok
chilli_connection are a_great default option_for any takeaway needs you might_have
whilst others may_have better quality_food
you'd be_a fool not to_check_out such_a legend
a_few_weeks_ago i_would_have said_that chilli_connection is_a_great_place_to stop_by to_grab your lunch_or_dinner
the_food_is tasty_and_the service_is_friendly_and very fast which_is good_as you_don't_have to hang around for_a_while waiting_for your_order
the_menu_is very expansive and they_offer_a set menu for_two_people with starters
main_dishes
rich
poppadoms_and side bits for which_is very_reasonably
the_main_dishes are_in_the region of and_they_have good_selection_of veggie_dishes to
however
they failed a health inspector report in march as the_staff failed to wash their hands and_there_were mouse droppings on_the_floor
the_owners have since said_that have completely cleaned up the_place
but it_does make_you think twice about going_there fore food which_is_a shame as_the_food is_quite wonderful
fresh enough
tasty enough and cheap enough chilli_connection is_a kebab
curry_and pizza place which ticks enough boxes but doesn't particularly stand_out
i_hadn't been_here in_a_while
before last_night maybe months
however_i had a_craving_for a_cheap and cheerful curry rather than my normal preference for_a_great curry
chilli_connection fills that need
a set meal_for only costs and_it includes a popedom
some vegetable_pakora and a_choice_of classic curry_with either rice_or nan
in_short you_get_a big bag of_food for_less_than the_curry alone costs elsewhere
all be it_for a_better dish
the_shop looks a_little worse for wear however the_curries_are good_enough
packed_with meat_and for_the_price great_value
chilli_connection is_an ideal place_to sooth those post pub food cravings
usually limiting the notion of_indian breakfasts to_the remnants of the_previous nights takeaway
i_was_pleasantly_surprised by iman's exotic delights
admittedly
i_had_a little trouble interpreting the_owners indian accent and_took the safe bet of ordering_the breakfast special
ghana puri halwa
see picture
arriving on_a shiny metallic platter complete with_a pot of ghana
a kind of_spicy chickpea dahl
halwa
a bizarre sweet tasting puree
flavour unknown to_me
and_some moreish puri
a kind of lightly fried flour tortilla
it_seemed i_was_in for_a feast
rich
spicy
and flavoursome i_found_this dish a_great_way_to start the_day and_at
and_it's cheap enough too
in typical brit fashion i_was left with_a chilli heat induced sweat on_my brow and_a yearning for_a cold beer
nonetheless
i'll be_back_for_more
i_hadn't been down here in_a_while and_all_of a sudden i_came across this_new kid and_what a_pleasant meeting it_was
it's sort of_an_indian bakery that caters for breakfasts and lunches
delicious treats and exotic meals await you here
i tried_their version_of halwa
we won't get into here_about who made_it first etc
and_it_was sickly sweet just_like it_should_be
at affordable prices this shop became the_highlight_of my saturday wander
would most definitely_come here_again
imans takeaway offer_a delightful range_of foods that_i at least have_not tried before
the_food_on offer is reasonably_priced
yet even_if this were_not the_case you_would still treat yourself to food_from here_every now and_then
as_it_is you_can regularly treat yourself to_the culinary delights on_offer here
the_location of_this shop enhances your likelihood of a_visit as although_the area offers many opportunities for bacon rolls
this_is_one_of a kind for_the area
my_main recommendation would_be to_try_something_new every_time you_come as_there is_a_great range on_offer here all at good_prices
i've never_eaten a_full meal_here
i_only come_in for_all_the different_types_of indian sweets
which i'm not_going_to try_and spell
my mumu spent part_of her childhood in_india
so_i remember being introduced to these amazing sweets at an_early age
and_this_place is_by_far_the_best place i've_found in_edinburgh to stock up_on all_things punjabi and sugary
with the_wall to wall counter stocked with_all sorts of amazing sights and smells
if you're out_and about in_this part_of tollcross and fancy afternoon tea with_a difference
you shoud get yourself in_here
my_personal favourite is_the kulfi
ok
so_it's made_with evaporated milk
double cream_and condensed milk
but it'll be worth_the hours you'll be spending in_the gym afterwards i promise
so_far i've tried_the pistachio and_plain flavour
and_the_mango is next on my_list
they're about to_open up another branch on nicolson street
which_is just along from_my flat
very_excited
byob is_always_a winner in my_eyes it means an_extra course of_food_and a_lovely drink
a_friend hosted people at_this_restaurant and_i_was impressed_by the_fact_that they managed_to bring all our_orders at the_same_time it_did take quite awhile but bearing in_mind that we_are talking about completely different orders i_thought_that was impressive
their poppadoms were scrumptious as_well and_the_staff very_friendly
their menu_is_extensive perhaps too extensive
with house specialities
family specialities
regional specialities and a_lot_of choice
even a_small section for british food should you happen_to decide upon entering this indian_food establishment that_you don't_want indian_food_but would rather opt for fish_and chips
portions_are ok the_best value would most certainly_be the_half tandoori_chicken
but_i_was impressed_by all_the_dishes i_sampled names i_have promptly forgot after_my third glass_of vino
a_great_place_to get_your indian_food kick in_the_area
my_favourite in_edinburgh
food_is mostly the_usual curry_house fare but_all done well
inexpensive when_you consider the_quality
staff friendly_and service good
byob a_huge bonus
really great_food_and fantastic_service
i suggest_you experiment a_little and_try something new
everything_we_had was_delicious
it's byob
so don't_forget_to bring_your_own wine or beer
my_first trip here_was for_an office xmas night_out and_it surpassed my_expectations
we_were loking for_a byob indian_and so decided it_was_worth a_try based on some good_reviews
there_were of_us in total ans it's xmas party season so_i_guess i_was prepared for things_to be_a_little chaotic but was_pleasantly_surprised when there_was_a number_of staff ready and waiting_for us
we_had_been placed in_the_back room which on_the plus side is private so_we_could be ourselves and not_have to_worry too_much about who's next_to you
my_only complaint_was that_it_was probably a_bit_too small_for us_and we_did feel a_bit crammed in however that seemed quickly forgotten when the_staff arrived with plates_of poppadoms_and dips and_of_course plenty corkscrews to assist us_in opening wine
we_had_the course festive menu at
per head and i'm_still struggling to figure out how_they managed to_make_a profit from it
the_deal included poppadoms n dips
the_restaurant then provided everyone with_a rather generous plate_of starters including
pakora
samosas_and bhajis each with a_small side salad each_item was_a_good size and_everyone managed_to clear their plates good start
being gluten_free i_made them aware and_was treated to_my very own selection_of gf starters including chicken_tikka
lamb skewers and bombay potatoes fantastic
for_main everyone_was asked to_choose what_they wanted from_the a_la_carte_menu
nothing was_out_of bounds and_there_was a_fantastic range_of chicken
lamb_and seafood dishes
i_opted_for one_of mum's home_cooked specials
desi saag chicken
which_was_really tasty_and spicy_but_not overly so
this_was accompanied by as_much white and brown_rice and naan_breads as_we could_eat
and boy did we give_them_a run for_their money but_it just kept coming
dessert_was ice_cream
but with_their very own ice_cream shop next door_and flavours
turkish delight seemed popular
we_were_not_disappointed
throughout_the_meal the_staff_were really_friendly struck a_good balance_of being there_when you_need them but lft us to_enjoy our evening
even_when the singing started towards_the end they were_fantastic
it made_for a_fantastic work night_out and evryone was ravving about_it at work after with_many
including me
definately planning a return_visit
byob proper punjabi food
great_service
reasonable_prices for really_good food
on par with home_cooked punjabi food
atmosphere_was lively
lots_of large groups
the loo's need attention i'm not_sure about the_decor but_i'd certainly visit_again for_starters mains
a_lovely venue
and_the_food_is fabulous
if somewhat overpriced at lunchtime
be_prepared_to savour what_you_get
though the_service_is s l o w
i fell out_of_the stand late one_night with_a choice on_my hands
chippy or try cellars
i'm_so glad_i chose_the later
don't_let_the front fool_you
this_place_is like_the tardis
i'm_not sure_if there_are cellars exactly but the_place_is huge
that's brings me to_the restuarants biggest problem
it's_always empty
now i'm_not saying the venue itself_is lacking
but_when there_are_no people around you_do lose the_atmosphere
the_food_is wonderful
i_had nalli gosht and_the_lamb_was perfect
cooked exactly right
i_also_had half_of my girlfriend's lal mass
this_place makes_me a_bad boyfriend
please visit
it deserves your custom
i_came_here_with my flatmates late last year before a flat party in old_town
it_was_a thursday evening and_we_all got a_discount because apparantly that's_what they_give everyone on thursdays to sundays
i_almost took this as_a sign_of desperation
but_the_food and_quality_of service proved that_it's actually a great_restaurant
the_menu_has a_good range_of meat_and vegetarian curries which_are all authentic to_india and_are drawn from its numerous regions
i_opted_for_the lamb_rogan_josh which_was quickly prepared_and and quickly eaten as it_tasted so_good
it_had_a delicious blend_of_spices and the_lamb_was_tender with virtually no fat
this
along_with a chapati and_a coke came_to just over which i_thought_was pretty reasonable
cellars is_right next_to_the the stand comedy club and so_is ideal eating in before_the show
i_have_to_say i_was_disappointed when someone told_me this_was_the_best indian in_edinburgh
i_wanted_to_try some_indian while_i_was in the_uk since_it's suppose to_be better_than what we_have in_the_us
i'm_still confident uk indian_is better_than_the us but_i_will need another place_to corroborate that
on_the plus side
the_staff_is really_nice_and attentive
first of_all
i confused myself
as i_have_been calling this_place indian thali as_i swear that_is what_it says above the_door and_not cellars
but
for a_place_that hides itself away next_door_to the stand
you_can easily miss it
as my_friend has done
walking past it on_a daily basis for_years
but_if_you do
i suspect secretly you_would regret_it
it_does do thali and_has_a separate menu_for it
for up_to thirteen pounds
you_will_be filled to sufficiency on some_of_the nicest indian_food in_the_area
if you read my reviews
then you_might argue that_i say_that about nearly everywhere or i_just have_good taste
don't argue with_me
i_can't reply easily with words of_an appropriate calibre on a_review site
with a_choice_of dishes along_with daal
poori or chapatti
rice_and pickles raita
i_don't recommend_the poori
unless you_are_a lover of all_things deep_fried
but the_rest_of my_meal was_fabulous and_the empty plates for_all four_of us_with constant mumbles of delight proved how_good it_was
you_may note that each_dish is_pretty tiny
but looks can_be deceiving all of_us_were stuffed by_the_end
if_you_have the_vegetarian thali
i totally recommend the_aubergine dish it_is smoky deliciousness with_a good kick
the_meat thali were successes as_well lamb_rogan_josh
chicken with_spinach
butter_chicken_and so on
i_almost forgot to_mention_the starters
prawns marinaded lime and caron seeds and_then deep_fried dry of oil and grease the_pakoras my_dinner dates shared looked equally so
a_special note of the_main menu as_well had a_lovely varied menu with_lots_of interesting dishes to_try over_and above your staple choices
all in_all
if_i_had known this_was called cellars in the_first_place
i_would_have known this_was_a gem from the_yelp_reviews
not_only with the_standard of_food we_had but_also in the_service as_well
as_it happened
i_didn't check yelp
but_i tried and_loved_it anyway
sometimes it_is_good to_be bold
dropping down a_wee bit as my_last_visit took come edge off my ardour for cellars
firstly
thali isn't served_at the_weekend
boo
so_we_had to_choose_from the_main menu
the boy decided_to try_the_chicken dosa
which_he found lookwarm and_not particularly tasteful
mainly disappointment fore than_anything else
i_tried_a spinach
vegetable and dried fruit curry_which_was lacking_in fruit
a stuffed parantha with_spinach and_garlic was_also lacking_in flavour
service_was spotty and this_is_a personal gripe why is_it when_a glass_of_water is ordered alongside an alcoholic drink
does the_water always_get omitted
anyway
definitely less impressed perhaps it_was because_it_was busy
or i_just prefer the_thali experience
but_i'm a_little_less enamoured now than i_was before
and_i slip further down_the star scale
i'm_just not_as impressed as_i_was the_first_time_i visited and_i_don't know_why
the_thali we_had this_time was burnt and too spicy_for_me
dhaal watery_and lacking_in lentils
rice overcooked enough_to lose texture
lime pickle that_was as tough as old boots
ajwani jinga prawns
supposedly flavoured with lime juice and caron seeds
semi covered_in breadcrumbs
mainly tasting of oil and prawn
i'm sad
but_at the_moment it's fails out_of
service was_on_the otherhand getting warmer than previously experienced
but_overall
i_am less impressed than i_would_like_to be
with it's swanky lago
clean_and crisp interior and_the odd incense stick burning away on the_counter
the curry_leaf is_a refreshing alternative_to your usual take away curry
out_of ideas and with_little patience to_cook for_myself i've opted_for_the curry leaf's classic lamb_rogan_josh on many occasion
followed by their light_and fluffy naan_breads
the classic dishes_are inexpensive and_with_a home delivery service i_see no reason_to claim that_the curry_leaf offers everything you_could possibly want from_a indian_take away service
top stuff
my flatmates and_i_was first made aware_of the curry_leaf when_they posted a flyer with their_menu under the_door of_our flat
it literally sat there on_the doormat for_about two months until one_night in december
whilst in_the throes of exams
we_decided_to order a_curry
their menu_is_extensive
offering chicken
beef or lamb_in a_wide_variety_of sauces_and all for_more or less the_same_price
further
they_serve vegetable curries for_only about
i_ordered_the_lamb balti with plain_rice and_a shawermah naan
in total
and including delivery
it came_to between four_of us which seemed_like_a lot but it_was_delicious and_we_were absolutely stuffed by_the_end_of it
we even_had left_overs to_put in_the fridge for_lunch_the_next_day
my_only criticism is_that_the shawermah naans turned_out_to be just plain despite us paying extra_for them
regardless
however
the curry_leaf serves excellent_food at_reasonable_prices and is_definitely worth_a_visit for_a_late night indian feast
started just over a_year_ago
curry_leaf is_one_of_the most upscale indian takeouts i've_been_to_in edinburgh
it's owned by_a friendly guy called riaz
pictured
with_his very_friendly pose
it's located_in_the peaceful area_of bruntsfield and_is the_only_one of_its kind that_i'm aware_of in_the_area
strictly a_take_out business
there's not_even the pretence of a_table or_two
and from_the semi long_wait and cooking sounds i_could make out in_the_background
the food's freshly made
and it_tastes that_way
it_was_a friend's delicious meal of_chicken bhuna and peshwari_naan that led me there
i_suppose i_have simple tastes
but_i'm more enchanted by_this naan than_anything else
it_has coconut in_it
definitely a_great side to the_meal
which also didn't disappoint
the_rest_of the_menu_is quite extensive
and is_very fancily worded
it's more expensive than your_typical take_out
but_once_you take_a look_at the_menu_and the d_cor you'll figure out why
hoocha wawa
my take away heaven
fresh
simple_and hot
the curry_leaf in bruntsfield is_so unlike the_standard take aware fare that_it deserves it's own yellow pages category
i_don't stray too_much up_and down the_menu these days
sticking with_the gourmet jalfresi and_a brace of chapati
it's damn hot
but gets those endorphins screaming
what's more it's licensed to sell beer so you're never going_to_get caught out at_home sucking an ice cube and crying like_a baby when you've chewed through_a chilli
portions_are big
but probably match the_price
i'm not_a_huge_fan of_the_rice the_first couple_of_times i_ordered i_felt i_had_to have_it
but i_think_it's better with_a_couple_of chapatti now
i'm_going_to keep on coming back until my chilli gland shrivels and dies and leaves me_to korma hell
no cure for common cold
i_wanted a really_spicy curry to_clear me_of_the dangers of_the imminent cold i_felt coming on
and_was driving home_from work through bruntsfield
knowing very_little about_the curry_houses of brunters i_took pot luck at_this_place
it's_a well presented take away
which_was part_of_the allure
and i_had_heard about_them before
the_menu_was relatively standard
and i_chose a jalfrezi as_i know this_is_a standard safe bet spicy number
garlic_naan and_a_couple side_dishes yes i_know
i_am_a pig
so
firstly
flavour levels were low
particularly in the_curry
naan was_fine and sides were a_complete non event
secondly
there_was next_to no_spice in_this curry
now i_know_the brits apparently can't handle spice
but_i_can
and_was bitterly disappointed at the_lack_of effort here
seriously
take_my advice and_don't waste_your time
my_first_experience of holi spice was_an odd one i_had made an_order for_take away_and when_i_went to collect it their card machine wasn't working
so_they gave_it to_me for_free
with free popadoms
i_felt quite bad though
and after_eating the_meal
which_was_delicious
i_went_back with cash
the_food_is_delicious
really yummy and full_of_flavour
everything_is made_fresh to_order
my_favourite is the_chicken_korma
which is_as_good_as any i've ever_had
as the_indian is_also_a restaurant
however
i_always feel really uncomfortable walking_in
i've_only ever seen one table eating when i've been_in
all_the_other times it_has_been empty
as a_result
the_staff_are extremely attentive_and were pouring over themselves to_serve me
giving me freebies left
right_and centre
i_always choose to collect the_food myself as_i only live minutes away_and i_like_to think i'm burning the calories i
m about_to consume
but_they also_have free delivery
i_really hope holi spice survives
it's_a really_good_indian and the_staff_are lovely
this venue tends_to change hands a worrying amount i'm_sure the_last_time_i walked past it_on my_way to_an exam at st
leonard's it_was_a tapas place
nevertheless
my flatmate and_i_thought we'd give_it_a try
there_was nothing massively different between it_and any_other_indian_restaurant you'll find in_edinburgh all the_usual suspects are on_the_menu_and they're all under_a tenner
but_what was_good about_this_place
apart from the_fact_that it's_just across_the_street from_the holyrood a_for a_beer afterwards
was that_they lso had_a load of more random curry_dishes on_the_menu too
like_the mohonwala which_comes with mango pulp
coconut
almond
cream_and fresh cheese
the annoying thing though
is_that depending on_what meat you get_your curry_with it_almost doubles in price_for even the_most basic curry made_with king prawn will cost you
whilst the_veggies among you_will only have_to_pay a fiver for_the_same dish
also
although they_do_have all these other less known curries that_i_was mentioning before
they're all twice the_price too
i'm_a penny pinching student
which_is why i'm whingeing so_much
if_you're_not
you'd probably like_this_place as the_service_is_great and_the_food_is tasty
they also_do carry_out delivery too
so if_you_can't even be bothered to_leave your sofa you_can still get_in on_the action
not_bad
i_must_say
though the_masala curry_was oddly sweet
my_brother and i_ate_here our_first night in_town
and_quite enjoyed_it
the_lamb naan was_very
very_good
the_chicken pakoras_were oddly slimy inside
though
like some_of_the batter hadn't been cooked thoroughly
chicken was_cooked
though
so all's good
delicious chutneys and_sauces for_the papadum
so_that was_great
i_was_very surprised_by passage to_india
i_was given an extremely warm welcome by the_manager_and he pulled the chair out_for my_girlfriend
touch of old school class
i_ordered_the_chicken shashlik on a_recommendation and_i wasn't disappointed
big chunky kebabs marinated_in a_mild curry_sauce with safron infused rice
heaven
the_best_part was the_price
both_of_us ate for and_we_got glasses_of wine on_the house
as_a rule
i_tend_to find you_can judge an_indian_restaurant by the_smell when_you first walk_in
this useful tip has come_in very handy more_than once i_have_found and
i_am proud to_say
my nose didnt let me down_for passage to_india
my_mouth was watering by_the_time i_had sat down at my_table
and had_ordered my_drink with the_most friendly_staff member i_had ever met he_was funny
helpful_and just all round nice
the_food_was certainly_not a dissapointment my lamb masskai was beautiful
and_all_the sundries we_had_ordered were just_as_good
the_price_was also_pretty good_with of_us dining for around each
which_was the cherry on_top_of an already good cake
the_thing which first attracted my mates and_i to passage to_india was its name and original sign
this_place_is definitely_not just any ordinary restaurant
and_i_would even go so_far as to_say_that it_is flawless
from the_moment we_walked_in we_were_greeted like old friends by one_of_the friendliest waiters i've ever met
the_decor_is stylish and unique_and the tasbles all seem perfectly placed to_give a_comfortable atmosphere
the menu_is_extensive and has_a_good range_of kormas
tandoori specials and_other authentic_indian dishes
i_ordered_the_lamb tikka
plain_rice and_a_naan which all arrived pretty quickly_and tasted incredible
the_sauce_was amazingly creamy_and had_a_good blend_of_spices whilst the_lamb_was clearly of_the_best quality
we each spent about
on_a great
filling meal and_some real indian_beer
i_would_recommend passage to_india any day for_both impeccable food_and_service
passage to_india is_just another curry_house serving up dishes_with muddled flavors that won't excite you
paratha was_a_bit dense and_came to_the_table when_i_was half way through my_curry
i_did a_curry tour of_edinburgh while_i_was there_on holiday
see
i_eat curry_and spicy_food like nobody's business i_eat food_so hot that_i've literally watched others cry over_a mere taste at my_food
so
i_decided_to hit a_different indian_joint each night while_i_was in_the_city in_search_of the_most flavorful_and spiciest_curry
this_place_was pretty_good
the_staff_were more interested in chatting with each_other than serving
which i'm_not opposed_to as_a rule but_it_wasn't the_most welcoming atmosphere
also
the_prices_were a_bit higher than_i_expected
which sort of put me_off
and
since_i'm complaining
my request for_the dish to_be
extra extra_spicy
was obviously not taken seriously because_i could've poured my_meal into my_eyes and_it wouldn't_have hurt
that aside
the_atmosphere_was very elegant and simultaneously welcoming
which_was_nice
and_the_food_was very_delicious
i'm not_sure i've ever_had a tastier dal
lentil
dish than the_one_i had_here
that_i_had to_bring my_own thai chile peppers to_add even_a zest of_spice was unfortunate but the_chef's ability_to bring_out subtle flavor was_extremely impressive redeeming in_and of itself
so
not edinburgh's spiciest_curry and_never going_to come close
but_it sure tasted_good
my flatmates and_i visitited tikka mahal shortly after it first opened during_the summer last year
the_menu looked entising and relatively cheap from the_outside so_we decided_to_give_it_a go
the_decor inside was pretty_nice with newly painted yellow walls shiny mirrors
it's intended to_be_a takeaway as_well a_restaurant and probably does equal trade through both
we_decided_to sit_in and_we_all ordered a_curry with_rice_and_a naan
i_opted_for_the chicken rogan_josh which didn't take too_long to_arrive and tasted_great when it_did
the_portions_were also excellent_and_the meal only cost us about each
my_only criticism is_that at_that time_we_were probably some_of their first customers and_they_were keen to see_what our reactions were to_the_food
so it_felt like_we were_being constantly watched whilst trying to_eat which_was irritating
i_doubt you'd have_that problem if you went now though
and_tikka mahal is_a well_priced indian with great_food
tikka mahal is fairly recent on_the takeaway scene in_edinburgh and_it_has made_a pretty big impression on_me
situated in_the newington area_of edinburgh
tikka mahal is_just_a short walk_from the_city centre and_it_is very_close_to the_university so it_is_a convenient place_for students to_go_to for_dinner
despite being called tikka mahal
giving the impression that it_is_a curry_house
they also_do kebabs
burgers
pizzas and fish_and chips so a_bit_of everything
i_came_in with a_friend_who ordered_a_chicken korma curry with_rice which_he said was_really_tasty and_the_rice_was well_cooked
i_had_a burger and chips which also tasted really_good and_the_portions_were a_decent size
our_meals came_to about five pounds each which_was_a really good_deal
there_is quite_a substantial dining_area inside the_shop
and_tikka mahal also does takeaways as_well as home deliveries which_is incredibly convenient
i_haven't_been back since but_i_had a_good_experience here i_definitely plan to_go_back
i_absolutely_love tikka mahal
it_is the_only_place for indian_pakistani food in_edinburgh
they_are_very gracious when_you_walk in
and_all food_is prepared fresh to_order
the_quality_of_the chicken is_fantastic
and_you never get weird chewy parts like_i often find_at other cheap establishments
both the_chicken karahi and_the_chicken rogan_josh are divine
they roll our the_naan_bread fresh right there for_you
i'm a_huge_fan
chicken_korma takeaway was_delicious sweet sauce_and tender_chicken huge portion one order_was enough_for people
enough sauce for_both rice_and nan
cheese nan_was giant and_awesome
part kebab shop and part curry_house tikka makal does a_good solid curry_and decent pakora all_for a_very reasonable_price
however there_is nothing particularly special about_it
the_curries_are prepared fresh while you_wait and_it_is a_reasonable sized portion
which_is_nice however there_isn't a massive variance in_the flavours of_the_curries
in_short there_are_better choices
all be it a_little_more expensive
in_the_area
however tikka mahal is normally fairly quiet_and is certainly good_enough to_satisfy the_indian comfort_food craving
while in_edinburgh on holiday
i_went_on a_curry tour
see
i_eat spicy_food like_you breathe air
back_home
i get_my take away_and add both habaneros and ghost pepper hot_sauce before_i eat_it
my spice tolerance is ridiculously high
i've also eaten curry_on three separate continents
so_i_know my curries pretty well
so
i_picked a_different indian_joint each night_and went_on_a search for_the_most flavorful_and spiciest_curry
i_came onto this_place midway through my adventure
it_is_very much a diner style_indian restaurant_with a_very casual
laid back atmosphere
it_is family_run the father in charge did most_of_the translating to the_staff that prepared_and served my_food
there_wasn't_a vegan_friendly vindaloo on_the_menu but_there_were several meat based vindaloos
so i_asked_if it_would_be possible to_order_a vegetable vindaloo
the father quickly assured me that_would_be okay so_i_ordered it extra_spicy with_rice_and chapati
now
i_don't_want_to gripe
the_prices here were_very cheap
and_the_food_was flavorful as anyone could ever hope for
seriously
but
what_i ate wasn't_a vindaloo
i_wonder if maybe the_chef just made_me a vegetable_curry instead and hoped i_didn't_know better
so
it_was_very delicious_and_i won't complain about_that
but_it_wasn't spicy_and_it wasn't_a vindaloo
luckily i_brought along three thai chile peppers to spice it_up
of_course
thai chile peppers to_me are about_as spicy_as cinnamon to most_people
but_still
it_definitely helped bring_out the inherent and distinct flavors of_the_dish
so
the_food_wasn't spicy_but i'd_come again just because_of_the place's affordability and_their willingness to_accommodate customer wishes
good on you
mates
i_wanted good_and family_run kind of indian_restaurant_in my_last day in_edinburgh
i_found_this restaurant_on tripadvisor and lucky that_i_did
i_ordered chicken_with okra in some_kind_of curry_sauce and garlic_naan_bread
topped with a_mango_lassi
all_that for_under british pound
wow
food_is made_fresh to_order
it_was_a_little greasy but god everything_is so_tasty i_don't mind at_all
and the_mango_lassi comes_in a pint
no kidding
too_much_for one_person really but_i_had my_water bottle with_me so_i poured the excess into_it for later
tasty
good
honest
family_style indian_food_for so little money
portions_are big
i skipped lunch and_only had_a snack since breakfast so_i devoured everything
i_probably could_not have if_i_had had a_regular sized lunch
well
the_other customers tend to_take_the leftovers home so_i_guess that_it_is okay too
what a_great_find and wonderful way_to stay warm in_a cool and damp fall evening in scotland
family_run curry_house in_a similiar style to kebab mehal
and offers the_usual array_of indian_food options
inexpensive
hearty and_good food_with those qualities you_cannot go_wrong really
its_not a_restaurant but more_of_a kebab curry take away so the_decor_is minimal with_a resonable ammount of chairs and tables for patrons
i_like_the price
the food_and_the_service
definately worth_a look if you fancy a_cheap lunch_time meal deal or a_cheap but_tasty biryani in the_evening
this_restaurant just_opened days_ago
so there_were_some glitches and service_was_a_bit shaky because there_were two people trying_to serve_the tables_and orders_were mixed up a_bit
they_have both lunch_and_dinner buffets
lunch_is
and dinner_is
the weekend_buffet goes to
and i_don't_know_if there_is anything different to_make weekends more expensive
i_had the_buffet_and my_wife_had saag chicken
her dish was_very_good
she asked_for_it not spicy_at_all
there_was some spiciness
but she_could live with_that and_it's good_that she_is growing in her tastes
the_buffet_was good except_for a_major glitch which soon smoothed out
something happened_to the heated water under_the steamers
and_some_of_the food_had cooled somewhat before they_got it_back up_to piping_hot
i_won't remember all_the_dishes but they_had vegetable_samosa
a_spicy lentil dish
chana_masala
aloo palak
jeera rice
chicken_korma
tandoori_chicken
chili beef
and gulab jamon
except_for_the temperature issue
the buffet_food was_quite_good
i_tried some_dishes i_have_never_had and_it_was all_good
the_gulab jamon was_outstanding the_first_time i've_had this dessert
one issue we_had_was with an_order_of garlic_nan
there_was no garlic
there_was_a mixup in orders
he deleted the_amount from the_bill
we will_be_returning and_it's close_to_home
so_i_can to take_out
too
the brochure syas they_have live music and karaoke thursday through sunday
the_owner promised to play something_for us
but he_got too_busy helping out
this_is_a small suite in_the village square plaza a_few doors east of_the regal cinemas and next_door_to the coldstone creamery store
capacity is rated at people
so_it's a_small_place
if_you_go to their_website
you_can download their_menu as_an excel spreadsheet
i_loved this_restaurant
i travel all_over_the country and_always eat_indian if_i can
vegetarian_friendly
gluten_free friendly
casual atmosphere
the_staff_is overwhelmingly nice
warm
friendly
by_the_time_we left
i_felt_like they_were friends
i let them pick out my_food using my gluten_free restrictions and_was amazed with my_meal
the bhel poori was_so unique_and filled_with flavor
the_dosa tasted like_the dosa's that i_ate in_india
the_owner
s
sang songs and entertained us unexpectedly
we meant to pop into the_restaurant for_a_quick meal
we_left feeling_like we_had_a casual night out_on_the town with new friends
go eat_at pyaars
then go_back
this_place_is near a movie theater and is_so new that_it had_no sign yet
find_it
it will_not disapoint
best priced indian_food_in_vegas
they_have only been_open a_week and_were having some trouble with_their oven
so the_naan wasn't great
the_food_was way too_salty but_was otherwise great for_their first week
their chef used_to work at gaylord indian at the_rio so_i_was surprised_that their_dishes tasted very different_than at gaylord
not_bad different
just different
harold the_owner_is_a great person to chat_with and_service_was outstanding
i will_give them another_chance in a_few_days and see_if they_have_the kinks worked out
i_can_see giving_it more stars next_time
this_is_a very tough review for_me_to write
on_our trip_to pyaar the_one good_thing i_can_say about the_restaurant_is the_owners_are some_of_the nicest and_most accommodating people you_could hope to_meet
unfortunately
i_really didn't_like my_meal here
it_should also be noted that_this_is a_review only of_the dinner_buffet it's possible that ala_carte menu ordering will produce a_different experience
anyway
when my_wife_and_i discovered a_new_indian restaurant_was opening in_town we_were pleased
but_the news that_this one_would feature an_indian dinner_buffet had us over_the moon
we_are night owls by nature and during vacation times or on_weekends we aren't always ready_to go_in time for_a_lunch_buffet the_chance of_a dinner option_for indian_buffet sounded perfect
tonight we_went_in with_no expectations
or_so per_person for_dinner seemed_like_a good_deal
although_we were surprised_that naan had_to_be purchased separately
it's usually included with_the_buffet this_is the_first_time i've seen it_as an_extra
the_selection_was small and_i ran into immediate problems
i'm not_sure if_this_is synonymous with_the particular cuisine pyaar aims at they claim to_me
the_only north south mogul indian_restaurant_in_vegas
but i_was_surprised at_the presence of a_couple_of beef dishes
the_lack_of any real
main
dish for_vegetarians and_nothing at_all with_the nice sauces i've come_to expect_from indian_food
no paneer dish
no chicken_tikka_masala or chicken_makhani
no samosas
no pakora
no kofta of_any sort
what_i ended_up_with was_the_only two tandoori_chicken drumsticks
some_of_the very wet
chilli beef
some_of_the vegetable_curry and a_lot_of rice
the_tandoori_chicken_was fine if unspectacular and_i'd have_been ok to_eat that_and write it_off as_a
notch in_the belt
but_not somewhere i_wanted_to visit_again
but unfortunately the_rest_of_the tandoori_was thighs which i_don't_like
the_chilli beef tasted like_a generic beef stew with a_bit_of chilli powder added
potatoes were_ok ish but a_bit hard in the_vegetable_curry
my vegetarian wife fared even worse than me ending up_with_some chick_peas and_a_bit of_potato on_top_of a bed_of basmati_rice
by_the_time our_naan
which tasted like_a flour tortilla
arrived i realised that_i_had nothing_to mop up as_there was_no dish featuring any_of_the delicious gravies i_have come_to associate with_indian_food
around minutes into the_meal my_wife pretended to receive an urgent phone call and_we apologised and_asked_for the_check
the_owners felt bad_for us_and were_extremely nice
offering to_let us fill up to_go boxes from_the_buffet and_they waived the_cost of the_naan
now
perhaps it's a_different type_of indian_cuisine_and it's_just our personal taste
but we_really didn't_like the_buffet here at_all
i_feel bad having_to pan this_place_so harshly because i_really_liked_the owners
but_i hope if_they read this_review they consider some changes to their_buffet because right_now it's uninspired bordering on inedible
we immediately got_a great sense_of family in this_restaurant
their name is fitting
as
pyaar means love
when_we_walked into this_restaurant
it's as if_we_were all_good friends
meeting together for_the_first_time in_years
i'm assuming this_is family_owned
the mother
father
and son were_more_than willing to_accommodate us
we aren't regulars at_indian_restaurants and_the dad was_quick to_help
we_had_a mango_lassi
vegetable_samosas
ginger chicken
and chicken_biriyani
there_was more an enough_for leftovers
the icing on_the cake was_when the dad and son offered_to sing play for_us
let me_tell you
that man does an_excellent impression of frank sinatra
sammy davis jr
and louis armstrong
it made_my night
i'm sad_to hear that_the negative reviews are for_the_buffet
perhaps they_should have_gone with the_menu
like us
a true vintage vegas spectacle
go on_friday or saturday nights after for_indian_food with_a live jazz trio
belly_dancing
and occasional impromptu performances from al the singing chef
he's not_only the_chef
but_also the_owner_and he does a killer louis armstrong impersonation
this_is_a true must see
food_was_pretty_good
the_lunch_buffet_was small_but i_liked everything_i tried
nan_was extra which_made my lunch_buffet about
not_bad especially considering_the entertainment
ok confession
my_friend susan l drags me places_to try_new_things
and_i go willingly
she took_me to pyaar and_i shrugged and_said
roh k
so_we get_their and the_first_thing i_thought_was
i_am_so thankful for air conditioning cuz it_is freaking hot outside
we_sat_down and_it_was nice the booth was_really roomy and
our hostess
and_i_am thinking one_of_the_owners
brought_us ice water right away
i_ordered_a strawberry lasse
i_think that_is_the spelling
i_thought_it_was a soda
susan informed me it_was_a yogurt drink and_i wrinkled up_my nose
and_thought
oh crud i_ordered wrong
not_being a connoissieur of_indian_food
i_really have_a limited idea_of what_to_order
we_ended_up ordering biryani
beef
and chicken_tandoori sizzler
which was_a_little like fajitas
and_garlic nan_bread
the_server hostess owner brought_me my strawberry drink
and it_was_good
bonus
then she_brought the_biryani
which_was served a_little differently than i_had ever_tried before
it_had cucumber
onion_and fresh tomato sliced around it
it_was_very_good and_spicy
so_that yogurt drink was_perfect
it totally cut the_heat immediately
i_was_not crazy about the_tandoori
not_my_favorite at_all
susan enjoyed_it alot
she took_the left_overs
but this_is_not_a reflection on the_whole review
but_it_is not_the_best i_have_tried
the_other thing i_was_not crazy about
is the_buffet ended at_pm_and the_food_was still in_the trays after pm
just kind of
sitting there
however the_service_was really_great
very accomodating
the_tandoori usually comes on_one plate and_she made_sure it_came on two plates since she knew_we would_be sharing
i_thought_that was_really cool
she_also made_sure that our_water never_got too empty
i_thought_it_was really a_good_experience
but_it_is really far away_and it_isn't a_place_that i_would_go to on_a_regular_basis
i_gave it three stars_because it_was_good food
and_good_service
i_was_so excited that_there_was an_indian_place so close_by that_i_had to_try_it
the_menu_has so many_things to_choose_from
they_even_have chinese_food with an_indian twist
i_was_really tempted to_try_it but_i_thought i_should stick_to the indian_dishes first
i_started off_with_a blueberry lassi which_was_really delicious compared_to bollywood's mango_lassi
i_liked this_one better because_i could tell it_was made out_of fresh blueberries by it's texture
my_friend sharr and_i_ordered different_items so we_can sample more_dishes
we_ordered_the beef biriyani
tandoori_chicken sizzler
and_the_garlic_naan
the_beef biriyani was_good on_the_inside where all the_beef and_spices were but on_the_outside it_was_like white_rice
i'm_used_to having the_spices spread throughout
i_would_have to_say_i like bollywood's briyani better because_of how_the spices_are spread through out the_whole dish_and they_have_a curry_sauce that they_serve on_the side with_it
i was_impressed_with the_tandoori_chicken sizzler
anything_that sizzles on a_plate gets me instantly excited
i've_never_had tandoori before so_i_have nothing to_compare it_to but i_thought_it_was tasty
the_garlic_naan here_is flavorful and_i_like how_they pre cut it_before it's served
i_thought_the service_here was_very thoughtful
the_lady who took_our_order knew_we were sharing the_chicken so she_had it split into two plates
i'd_love to_come_back when they_have_the live entertainment and sample other items_on_the_menu
this_is an_indian_restaurant my
indian
husband_and_i will keep coming_back_to in_vegas
we had_dinner_here tonight with_a_friend from out_of_town
we_ordered a_lot_of different_dishes to_share family_style
we_started_with_the papads
which_were tasty_but didn't_come with_any chutney
surprising
the_mains followed with saag chicken
fish_curry
dal makhni
egg curry
upma
jeera rice
raita and_garlic_naan
we_felt like everything had_been lovingly prepared
it_just had_that homemade taste
the stand_out dish_for me_was_the egg curry just fantastic_and kind of hard_to find on menus at_indian_restaurants in_the_us
my_husband_and friend thought the_fish_curry was number one
with_a fresh tomato taste
only_one downside
the_naan_was just so_so kind of tasted like_the frozen supermarket naan that_they doctored up_with garlic_and cilantro
to_drink
we_all ordered fresh lime juices
which_were a_perfect accompaniment to_the foods
the_restaurant_is working on getting their liquor license within the_next few_months
in_addition_to the great_food
there_was live entertainment with_a jazz trio
and singing done by the_owner chef
the_chef and_his wife also came_over to chat a_few_times_and make sure everything_was ok lovely people
overall
it_was_a friendly_and fun atmosphere_and the_prices_were not ridiculous like at many indian_restaurants_in_town
first_off
the set_up is_beautiful
great_atmosphere and they_even had_a_good piece jazz band playing when_i_walked in
i_was_expecting something great from_the newly opened indian_restaurant
but_when_i had got_there
they_had miss placed my_order
they_were_out_of of_the_items i_ordered
and_the_food_was mundane
although
i_was extremely disappointed_in the_service_and the_quality_of_the_food
since the_staff_was extremely apologetic and_the setting was impressive
i'm thinking i_may give the_place a_second chance
maybe
i_tried_to dine here_at
on tuesday but they_weren't open yet even_though_the hours posted claimed they_opened at
am
i_came_to pyaar in_a roundabout way
you_see
i_asked_the hotel desk clerk if_he had_a menu for_the thai restaurant around_the_corner
archi's
he said he_did but they_had changed the_name to something else
he fussed around in_a drawer
not in_his drawers
that_would_be weird
said
here it_is
and handed me_a menu_for pyaar
i_knew right away that indian_cuisine_is not thai cuisine
i'm funny that_way
while_i have enjoyed being curried away at both
the_food_is distinctly different
anyone that_is even a_slight foodie is not_going_to confuse thai food with_indian_food
so_i_decided_to check them both out
and_i_decided on_indian instead_of thai
i_was the_only_one in_the_restaurant
i_tried ordering several things_and struck out with_an assortment_of
we're out_of that
and
he only makes that during_the day
hint don't put_it on the_dinner_menu
i_opted to_order several small things
i_started with_a veggie_samosa
followed with_some gobi paratha and to_go
rasmalai
i_really_liked_the samosa
the_gobi paratha was_pretty_good
with_a_nice robust and grainy bread
the rasmalai for_dessert was
interesting
very_sweet
overall
pretty solid indian
nice people_and reasonable_prices
and sanford and son on_the tube when_i left
too old school for_me
went here_for_the_first_time the_other_night
this_place_is_a gem
great_food
great_atmosphere
definitely a_special find here_in_vegas
i_will_be_back for_sure
this_is_my rd time eating_here
and first_time eating the_buffet
needless_to say i_am_not pleased
the_buffet_was about
and runs from pm
i_came_in about
i_was given water by the_owner
and_he never asked_me if_i wanted anything to_drink
on_the_buffet
all_of_the rice dishes_were on_the verge of dry_and crunchy
the eggplant_dish was_very bitter
the vegtable pakoras we dry_and unedible
the ground meat
i_think beef
was_just plain ole funky
the_bread that_came_with it_tasted_like it_was re heated
overall a_horrible buffet
during_my lunch
i_was never asked_how things_were or_if i_needed anything
the_cook is the_one who rang me_out when_i_was leaving and_he asked_me how things_were
and i_told_him dry
and not_very_good
he_told me i_needed to_come in_the morning and not_so late
so save your money_and go somewhere_else
i_hate to_say_it
because_i_was glad to_have_a indian_restaurant_in_the neighborhood
but_this_place isnt going_to last and is_going down fast
i_also noticed in_the_kitchen that_they_had
taste_of_india
seasoning pastes
this places says they_serve made_from scratch dishes
lol
when_i ate at_this_restaurant i_almost felt i_was_in_the twilight zone
the_owner
harold
and_his wife are so_friendly it's almost scary
they constantly come to_your_table and engage in conversation with you
harold asks for everyone's name and remembers it
i'm kind of making this sound like_a bad_thing
but_it's a_good_thing
a_very
very_good thing
the_world would_be_a much better place_if more_people were like them
anyways
they_have_a lunch_buffet_and used to_have_a dinner_buffet
but_they decided_to stop doing that unfortunately
which_is_a shame as_i always like_indian_food better when_i'm able to_pick out small_portions of various items rather than one large portion_of one_or two_things
indian_food sure does fill you_up quickly
i_decided_to just go_for_it anyway though
my first_time_here i_got veggie_samosas
tandoori_chicken
which literally sizzles as they_bring it_out for_you
and_garlic_naan
samosas
huge
they were_served_with two sauces
one sweet black sauce_and another minty cilantro sauce
i_really_liked_the sweet black sauce but_the minty cilantro sauce smelled too minty for_me_to put_it in_my_mouth
the_samosas_were filled_with curried potato_and pea flavor
they could_have_been_a little crunchier though
tandoori_chicken
i_ordered_the piece and_i_was shocked at_how large they_were
nice
spicy and_tender
very_filling too
naan
a_little_bit too_much cilantro
but pretty damn tasty regardless
like naan should always be
would_love_to return
i_would try to_do_so earlier next_time so_i_can try_the_buffet
even_if the_food_wasn't that_good i_would_probably still go_here just_for_the so_nice it's practically ridiculous service
the_worst indian_restaurant i_have_eaten in in_the_us
i_am indian_and i_will_not suggest this to_anyone
please avoid at_all costs
are_you kidding me
you_just spent min
telling us how great a_vegetarian diet is
you bring_us food_and every_dish has chicken in_it
sorry i_still don't agree_with the_whole chicken_is a_vegetable deal
a_little_more expensive than i_was comfortable with
everything_was ala_carte
very strange dining_experience
had a_coupon from not groupon
and_that sent the_owner off into_a tizzy about_the problems he_had with_the company
i_think it_was_a off coupon i_had purchased
but according_to him it was_supposed_to_be off
he claimed it_was_the company's fault
but_i_think maybe he misunderstood the_concept of the_groupon like sites
he_did honor it
but_i_felt like_i_was the_bad guy using it
the_food_was_pretty_good
though
but it_was_all a_bit overpriced without a_coupon
so_i doubt i'll be stopping back in_there
my rating is based_on_the over_all experience
i enjoyed_the_food
it_was fresh_and_tasty
and_there_was plenty
i_went_with a_friend_of_mine
the_only real reason for_not giving_it a or greater was_the strangeness of_our dining_experience
there_was no music or_any ambient noise and_we_were the_only_ones in_the_restaurant
so_it seemed_a_little eerie
there_was no_buffet
which_i was interested in seeing what they_had to_offer but was_not_disappointed because rarely do they_have chicken_vindaloo at_the_buffet which_is_what i_order
vindaloo was_good at_a on the_heat scale and the_veg
palau was_good_too
enough_for my_friend_and_i to_share with_some to_take_home
a_good_place_to go especially since this_is_one_of_the few indian_places on this_side_of_town
it's_really not fair to_rate an_indian_restaurant based on_its buffet_only
unfortunately
i only_have that_one experience upon which to base my assessment of pyarr
located_in village square
just_a_few doors down from_the regal cinemas
pyarr is relatively new
and_its obvious it hasn't built up its clientele yet
i_visited during_the_lunch_buffet with_a_friend one weekday
and we_were_the_only other_people dining in_there aside from_one guy at his lonely table
seating was open
but_we_were promptly greeted_and quickly brought water as_our drink_orders were_being taken
which left us to_hit up the_buffet
of_course
this_is where my_review gets highly subjective
the_buffet selection_was
let's say
not impressive
especially not if_you're_a vegetarian
hello
there were_only eight to hot plates from which to_choose
and none_of these_were fried goodies such_as samosa
pakora or papadum
the_selection does change daily
but_i'd rather see pyarr ixnay the bulk of_its mostly ignored cold condiment selections to_make room_for more hot stuff
and_maybe they_will when business picks up
the_buffet does include a serving_of their fresh_naan
however
and_i_will say_this
i_think this_is_the_best naan i've had_in_vegas
even counting my beloved india_palace
and even_though_the selection_was weak
the_food_i did_have
jeera rice
aloo palak
yellow daal
was_tasty_and just spicy_enough
the_service_was_excellent
we_were being checked up_on regularly
asked_for feedback on specific dishes
re filled_with beverages
maybe not accurately
but
etc
again
this might have_been because we_were_the_only people_in_the joint
but_hey
it's something
either way
i plan_to come_back_to explore the_menu further during_dinner hours
so_i_can maybe give_a more well rounded review
haq's is_a_good quality indian_takeaway on leith walk which offers great_food_and pretty fast delivery
my flatmates and_i_ordered a_curry from here_last year_and it arrived speedily and_at a_fairly reasonable_price
we had_one their menus put under our door earlier in_the year and_decided_to give_them_a shot when none_of us could_be bothered cooking or walking to_get_a takeaway
my only_complaint of haq's is_that_the phone call to_order the_food_was about_as strenuous as walking to_the nearest indian probably would_have_been
my mate had_to repeat just_about every detail twice_and was literally screaming our address down the_phone at the_guy
after this
however
the_food seemed_to take no_time to_arrive and_only cost about each
including delivery
i_had_the_chicken kathmandu which_was_delicious with good_quality meat
but just_about blew my_head off it_was_so hot
i_would_recommend haq's for delivery
just practise your elocution prior_to the_phone call
it's_been quite a_while since_i reviewed a_take away so its a_good job then that haq's was_a pretty interesting subject to_write about
firstly
the_food_here_is amazing the_traditional indian_cooking is splendid and_i promise you
whatever you_choose
you wont be dissapointed
no case of_food envy here
the take away service_is varied however
sometimes it_is_a well executed delivery and_other times it_is_so messed up you wonder how haq's can_get away with_it
theres no middle ground with_the take away service its either great or shocking
over_all though
the_quality_of_the_food and_the_fact it_is only around a tenner each for_a banquet means i_actually really rate this_place highly
yum
my_friend_and_i have_ordered several different curries from_here and_they_have all been delicious
from_the super_spicy to_the sweet_and tangy
it's_all been delicious and_filling
we really_like_the free pakoras you_get on orders over_and they_make really_great chapati
it's_so rare to_find such_good chapati in indian_restaurants anywhere
but haq's definitely did_not_disappoint
what a_great_place_for take away
totally_worth it
i've_been_here twice now
once when_i first moved_here and_then a_few_weeks_ago
the_first_time_i wasn't blown_away
but i_can't_remember why_not either
since_we can't find chinese to_meet our needs we branched out_to indian
the guy_who always works the_counter is_lovely and_they_offer a_student discount
which is_decent
they_also deliver for_free locally and are_very cheap
which is_fantastic if_you_are feeling_like some good_indian
but low on funds
they_have so_many curry's to_choose_from_and all spice_levels
the curry's are tasty_and big portioned
the_special rice
or non normal rice has red and_green colored rice
which_is weird
but_i believe you_can get normal white_rice
they_offer two meal deals
which_are less then quid and_you_can get either veggie or meat
it_is certainly an easy take away option and_doesn't disappoint if_you_want_a quick
cheap curry
not amazing
but for_the_price it_is tasty_and you can't_really complain
k is_a handy wee kebab house to pop into
situated in_the centre of_the newington area_of edinburgh
k is_just_a short walk_from the_city and centre and_it_is very_close_to the_university so_it_is incredibly convenient for_the students
k specialise in indian_and turkish cuisine
with dishes such_as curry's and kebabs
their_menu consists of_tandoori indian_dishes
as_well_as_the more popular curry's such_as korma_and rogan_josh
k also sells the_more traditional dishes too such_as fish_and chips
burgers
fried_chicken and pizzas
i_have_been_to k several_times for_dinner over_the years_and i_have_never_been disappointed_with my_meal
their burgers are extremely well_cooked and haven't got_a layer of grease on_them which you_can sometimes find with takeaways
the chips which_came_with it were_also very_tasty
and the_whole meal comes_to about_what a bargain
there_is_also a_good_selection_of vegetarian_dishes available on k 's menu_and so_there is_something for_everyone
you_are able to_order online on their_website and they_have_a home delivery service which_is incredibly convenient
k is open late so_it is_a_great_place_to stop_by for_some food on_your way_home from_a night_out
situated on clerc street
k kebab house is ideal for students from_the local halls of residence and i_went_there myself quite a_few_times during_my first year
at_that time they_used_to have_a deal on called 'chicken
chips and chutney' which cost and_was exactly what_it claimed to_be and tasted_great
although horrifically spicy
i_was back_in about a_week ago_and they're no_longer doing that deal
but they're still offering delicious curries
kebabs and burgers at_reasonable_prices
i_went_for_the lamb_korma with_rice which cost less than and tasted_great
my mate
however
ordered_a pizza which_came_with lashings of grease which_he had_to mop up
other_than_that their_food_is generally good_and well_worth a_taste
they_used_to have_a sofa at the_back_of k
a_bit leather one which_they invited you to_sit on whilst you waited_for your_food
then one_day
i_went_in
and_the sofa was gone
now i_don't_see the_point
i_think_it's because_i
and plenty of other_people i_know
kept going into k
ordering food then falling asleep on_the sofa this_was due exclusively to tiredness you understand
nothing else
i_know
i_know
it's_a curry_house
not_a bloody lounge
and
as_far as_the_food goes
it's pretty_good
fairly standard
but_tasty nevertheless
they_have_a quite funny offer on where you_get_a free can of pop with_a meal
but the_only cans you're allowed are rolla cola and dandilion and burdock
maybe cream soda too
it's_also cheap you'll not pay more_than_a fiver for_anything
so all in_all
it's a_pretty_good take away
but_it_was so_much_better when_they had_the bed
sorry
sofa
i_wanted_to like_this_place but as_a delivery option
it fell short_of expectations
first
it_took
hours for delivery
on_a non snowy edinburgh evening
second
the doner kabab w chips that i_ordered was_missing the chips the_garlic sauce that_it_was to_have come_with
lettuce was_a_bit on_the dried old side and_only slivers of tomatoes were included_in the_salad
third
there_was_a curry_sauce in_there that_had more_than the_usual amount of oil floating to the_top
i_think i'd come_back to_give_it another try
since the_price_is fair however
i'd avoid delivery and_do take away instead
i_received a leaflet under my door from taj express
and normally i_just throw them away because i_hate junk mail
but_i hadn't had_an indian_for ages and_the temptation got_the best_of me and_i_am so_glad it_did
taj express offer a_wonderful
tasty curry_at very respectable prices
i ordered_a_chicken balti
which_was_delicious and_you_get a_generous serving
i_also_ordered naan_bread which was_cooked_to_perfection
and_not_too greasy
unlike most_indian_restaurants
what's more is that_if_you spend over you_get free delivery which_is_great
the delivery time was_quite long at minutes
but the_quality_of_the_food more_than made_up_for this
this small unassuming takeaway
there_is_a dining space however there_are_no facilities
produces some tasty indian_food and_the_portions_are generous
i_particularly like the_tandoori_chicken biryani
the_chicken in_this is_cooked fresh when_you_order
though the_curries_are also flavorful
if fairly standard indian fair
in_the_area you_can't go far wrong_with taj express
the food_is_tasty and_there_is plenty of_it
whoever decided_to open another branch of iman's just_a five minute walk_from my flat is_my_new best friend
whilst threre's no denying that newington has more curry places than it_really needs
this_one is_definitely_a keeper
usually i'm wary of places_that offer too_many different_things to_choose_from on_the_menu
as_it usually means that it's_not going_to_be particularly fresh
but in_this case
it_just means i'll always be able to_try_something_new the_next_time_i come_here or order a_takeaway
so_far
my current favourite is the_tikka madras korma
creamy_and almondy like_a korma
but with_some kick_to it_at the_same_time thanks_to the madras
what's not_to love
and_at roughly
depending on which meat you_have it_with
it's not_going_to break the bank either
next_time i'll be trying their salmon punjab curry
which_is marinated overnight according_to the_menu
my_one criticism though
is_that_they also offer pizzas
but although this gives the impression of lacking authenticity
the_curries_are so_good_that i'll forgive them
walking_into iman's you_get_a kind of fast foody feel to the_place
everything_is clean
modern_and easily wipeable for_a_quick turnover
don't let this put you_off though
the_food_here_is excellent
iman's is primarily a curry_house but has other options if curry_is not_your preferred meal of_choice
they_do_a good range_of pizzas
about
for_a
and
for_a
especially the_meat bonanza
also the_grill serves some_great meat
with steaks
chops
kebabs and indian_dishes all on_offer
the_indian food_is_great
they_have_a huge selection_of starters
mains and sides
the_menu can_be_a_bit intimidating at_first as_there is so_much_food but_it_is all spread out into easily readable sections
the srarters are reasonably_priced
and surprisingly filling
with my_favourite being_the ginger and cinnamon king prawns
the_first_time_i came_here i_had_the_chicken reshmi kebab which_was refreshingly not dried out_and well_spiced
the_second_time i_opted_for a_curry and went_for one_of_the specialities
which i_would_definitely_recommend
the_chilli garlic
was_really hot but brilliantly flavoured
definitely one_of_the_better curries i've_had_in edinburgh
the_service_was_friendly
all the_staff seem very keen to_accommodate you
but_there seems to_be_a certain element of in_and_out going_on
the place_is_great
but sometimes just seems a_little_bit too fast foody for_my_liking
but_don't let this put you_off
the_food_is really_good_and if_you_live around newington definitely pop in
there's not a_whole lot to say_about imans
they_don't know_how_to use an apostrophe
i_can_say_that much
it's_a_great big new curry_house in newington whose full title is_actually 'imans grill a taste_of punjab'
inside it's fairly tastefully decked out
the_tables and chairs are a_nice
understated dark wood
there's nothing crazy going out
it's the_outside that gets me
the_sign is_an enormous what looks like leopard print
and_it's got big banners everywhere
just has the_look and feel of_a tacky place
onto_the food
then
the_selection here_is enormous
they've all different_types_of curries to_cater_to all tastes
they_even_have a british section
why the_hell would you go_to_a curry_house for_an omelette
who does that
anyway
the_curry i_had
lamb_saag
was_ok
not terrible
but_not mind blowing
just_ok
i reckon this_place would_be great to_take_a huge group to
it's bigger than_the batcave
i've_been_to the_one in bruntsfield as_well as on nicholson street
and_both have_been excellent
definitely_a step up_from other_indian_restaurants
and the_decor_and atmosphere_is inviting in_addition_to friendly_staff
i've had_chicken_tikka biryani
a specialty punjabi dish
can't remember the_name
as_well as tasted others' meals and_everything has_been great
also
it's byob which cuts down_on the_price_of the_bill and_is a_fun time to_get together with_friends
i'd recommend_this_place_to anyone
although i've been told it's_not authentic
i've never been_to_india so i_don't_know_what is
but it_tastes good to_me
this_is_a brilliant restaurant that_has only recently opened in edinburgh's new town
the_food_is some_of_the_best_indian_food i_have_tasted
the d_cor is_very_nice_and there_are photos of_india scattered around and_every table has a_small bunch_of flowers on_it
the_prices_are a_bit higher than the_average
but_it is_definitely_worth it_as the_quality_of_the_food is_so_good
fortunately it_was my_parents who footed the_bill
we_started by ordering a_couple_of papadums each
which_were very crispy_and they came_with_a large_selection of_sauces to complement them
i also_got a_large bottle_of kingfishers beer for
for the_main_course i_had_my favourite curry_chicken rogan_josh
and_the_chicken_was lovely_and tender_and the_sauce_was full_of_flavour
we_also order naans for the_meal_and they_weren't greasy at_all
which_you find_in many_other restaurants
my_dad is a_curry veteran and_has at_least_one a_week and_even he was_full_of praise for the_spice pavilion
i_am already looking_forward_to returning soon
i hail from_the midlands which_has some_great curry_houses
so i'm_always a_little apprehensive when dining_in curry places elsewhere
but a_quick google search found the_spice pavilion and_i_thought it_was_worth a_try
i_believe the style is kashmiri
and the_food_was_really excellent
we_ate garlic chicken
kathmandu murgh
with lentils and_garlic
and_a saag aloo
the_saag aloo was_the star dish
but all_three were truly excellent
the_service_was fine
although i_was_a_little unsure about the_way food_is served from_a trolley
but_otherwise fine
the_ambience was relaxed and children appeared_to be welcome in_the early evening
i_wouldn't hesitate_to return next_time i'm in_edinburgh
in_the words of david k
'npwh
nice people work here
'
the_friendly
pleasant matron of the_house came and chatted with_us after_we stuffed our faces full_of delightful indian_cuisine
it turns out_that she's italian
which led to_our earlier confusion about why some white lady was running an_indian_restaurant
but her husband
and chef
is_indian
mystery solved
at_any rate
this_is legit grub
it_may be pricey
especially compared_to the offerings one can_find on manchester's curry mile
but for_being in_edinburgh
the ability_to score real south_asian eats is a_pleasant surprise
if you're into spicy_food be_sure_to give the_vindaloo a_try
the boy likes it hot
and_spice pavilion's version certainly had_my nose beading up_with sweat
also lending to_the traditional british indian_restaurant offerings
you'll find cobra on draught
be_sure to_have_a pint or_two on hand if you're choosing menu offerings heavy on_the capsaicin
i guarantee you'll want_a sip of_something cold at hand to douse your tongue
considering_the extensive selection_of veg_and non_veg courses featured in_the densely packed tome of_a menu
it appears that i'll_have plenty more to_try upon future returns
needless_to say
i'm looking_forward_to the_opportunity
the_place_is headed very near george street in new town
we_shared a_couple_of dishes_and everything_was_great
all_the stuff was_also attentive
the women who_was in charge of_the_place
probably the_owner
did_a great_job also
she really made_us_feel welcome
my_only concern is the_decor
like_some other_places in_edinburgh its very simple decorated
clean with white walls
i_think though this_place could add a_little_more cozy touch
darker walls_and soft lightning
spice pavilion is_a smart new town indian
where we_received one_of_the warmest welcomes in_the_city
seriously
the_service_was absolute gold
and the_food_wasn't far behind that standard
either
well worth_a_visit
overall
we_said
i_really_enjoyed_the whole restaurant experience in_the spice pavilion
the_service_was just great
put you right at_your ease
and allowed you_to relax and_enjoy your lunch_at your leisure
in_the smart surroundings
it was_prompt_and accurate
as_well as_being overwhelmingly welcoming
the_food_is_fresh_and flavour packed
too
thereby ensuring that_every aspect of_our time_in the_place_was a_complete pleasure
went_here for_dinner_on new years day
and_even though they_seemed very_busy we_were_seated right away without a_reservation
we_tried_the pompadon which_came_with a_great chutney tray
and a_truly excellent saag_paneer
the_entrees
briyani
and chicken_tika_masala
were_tasty
came_in good portions
and_were well_cooked overall a_bit better_than average
service_was_a_bit_slow
but_not truly bad untill we_asked_for the_check
our_waiter started asking if we_enjoyed_the hogmany fireworks the_previous evening
which we_had
then proceeded_to rant about_how it_was_a waste of_money that_should go_to starving children worldwide
the_rest_of_the process was filled_with huffing and dirty looks
i'm_not insensitive to these problems
but getting lectured while i'm paying the_bill really ruined an otherwise great evening with very_good_food
excellent service_and_food to match
and_this coming_from some big indian_food fans from ireland
would_definitely_recommend_this_place
particularly the_tandoori sharing starter
even_the pilau_rice was_delicious
kebabish original is_a brand of restaurants_that now scale the_country a vast menu_that includes kebabs
curries
burgers
salads and mixed grills
this means that however fussy one_of your mates are
they_are sure to_find something_that tickles their fancy
from the_outside kebabish original looks really trendy and_modern with huge panel windows and inside this theme is continued and offers_a really cool
trendy place to_dine
i_came_here_with a_few friends after_a game of laser quest
which_is just down the_road and i_ordered_a kebab
as i_thought_this would_be_the safest bet as the_name_of the_restaurant suggests this_is their speciality
i_was right and_the kebab tasted fantastic
and_there_is no comparison between_the greasy kebabs i_have become used_to from cheap takeaways to_this well_seasoned one
my_friends weren't as complimentary about_the_food however
saying_that their_curries tasted greasy
so_i would therefore say that_if_you do come_here
that_you go_for_the kebabs
having chomped down_on various shish
doner and_chicken_tikka rolls from various kebabish outlets over_the years
i_have_to concur with el tel's viewpoint that_this_place is_excellent
as_long as_you stick_to the kebabs
and_what kebabs they_are
stuck on_a charcoal grill often right in_front_of you
the proper barbeque taste_is nothing short_of fantastic
the_salad is_fresh
and_if_you avoid the doner
a_few_of the grilled varieties probably aren't all_that bad_for your health either
having only tried a_curry once
it_wasn't at_the_same level
but_the kebabs are what it's all_about
what_they want you to_experience
so grumbling about that_would_be like going_to pizza hut and complaining that_the pasta is shite
which it_is
fantastic for kebabs
and with_their rapid expansion
a testament to good old free market economics
it's funny how a_place can_get some_things so right_and others totally wrong
i once had a_big argument with_a_friend about_how a_chicken kebab isn't actually that unhealthy grilled chicken on_a pitta bread
with salad
yeah but_what about the_garlic mayo and chilli sauce
well yeah
but mcdonald's don't put burger sauce on_their calorie count
do they
wallace
anyway
the kebabs in_this_place are excellent
beautifully seasoned_and genuinely tasty
and_cooked on_a charcoal grill
the_salad is_actually pretty_good too
not_just the_usual chopped red cabbage
why do kebab shops think_this_is ok
that_said
the_curries_are no where near as_good
my_friend_had a bhuna
obviously
we're northern
and_it had_about half_an inch of grease laminating the_top
the_actual curry tasted fine
but_he had_a slippery face afterwards
go_for_the kebabs
nothing else
what's this
yet another review_of something within spitting distance of_your house chris
quelle surprise
get over_it
it's happening
sure enough
kebabish is situated not two minutes_from my_house on dalry road
and_if i_wasn't spoiled enough already with_the likes of chop chop and sushiya a mere stone's throw away
amongst many_other fine places
there's now another place_to add_to the_list
that's right
kebabish was_surprisingly top_notch
we_were met
seated_and made our_order with_no fuss or bother and_the_food arrived pretty quickly too
fun times
so the_food_itself
my bud had_the chicken_wings for_starters
they_were amongst the finest chicken_wings i've ever_had in_a_restaurant
fact
i_went_for_the quail
more_for the novelty than_anything
and for_those who've not had quail
meh
it's alright i_guess
this_is purely down_to a consequence of_the_meat itself and_not_the cooking or presentation of_it it_was cooked_well and_has quite_a satisfying meaty taste
there's just_not much_of it
i_would_have much rather had_the wings
for mains we_both went_for karahis
i_got_the_chicken and he_got the_lamb
mine was_better
for_the uninitiated
a karahi is_a cooking pot which_is used in_the preparation of_the_dish just so_you_know
educational reviews
the_dishes themselves were mightily tasty with_a_nice mix_of spice_and flavour not bland_and hot like many_other curries
really quite delicate whilst potent
oh hello ginger
thanks_for that flavour explosion in_my_mouth
i_love ginger
accompaniments in_the form_of rice_and_naan were satisfying but somewhat short_of being noteworthy
and hey
how could we not_at least give mention to byob with_no corkage
simply brilliant
the fly in_the ointment and the_reason for four_stars in place of five
well firstly the_lamb in_the karahi was_a_little tough and
although still quite_tasty
hadn't been cooked anywhere long enough_to let it come close_to being as_good_as_the chicken
secondly
for_two popadoms and dips
i_even went and checked online to_make_sure we_hadn't been jipped and true enough there it_is plain as day
as_someone who_has frequented curry_houses since youth i_have_never in_my days seen that kind of disproportionate pricing
but_hey
don't buy the pops and you're in_for_a treat
have_been a_few_times
serivce good
staff friendly_and nice_atmosphere
food_has_been mostly good_but a_couple_of duff dishes
the overcooked prawn in particular
i'd still recommend_it though even with_the ocassional mistake
kebabish is_the uk's biggest chain of asian restaurants
their_dishes from the_grill are first class
i_didn't_care much_for the_place
though
and_the_service_was down right poor
overall
we_said
the_food that_i_had at kebabish was_extremely good
the_service_and setting don't match it
at_all
the frowner in chief should turn his attention away from glowering at his chefs and glower at his serving staff
instead
if_that dead eye stare has the_same effect on_them as_is does on the_kitchen staff
he'll address the place's real weaknesses
in no_time
we_decided_to visit kebabish after a_bunch_of guys from my_office had_a team night_and mentioned it_as a_bit_of_a meat fest
wow
the_first_thing is the_smell grilling meats
mmmmmmm
from its quite trendy decor to_the very attentive_staff it_was super all round
i_had_the sheek kebab to_start large
flavoursome and piping_hot pieces_of yumminess
and husband_had malai boti chicken which_was a_lot_of meat for a_starter
our_waiter_was very knowledgeable
as_i_had queried what_was the hotter of_two main_dishes
and he_suggested i_order the north_indian chilli garlic lamb with_great flavours but get_it vindaloo hot
husband_had lamb jhalfrezi which_was succulent and_rich he mentioned how tender the_meat_was
there's_a mixed_grill which sounds amazing
the boys at work had_it
which_is_a huge pot of chops
steaks and_other carnivorous delights
even_better
it's_a byo with_a co op next door so three bottles of san miguel for was_all we splashed for drinks
service_was brisk but_not rushed and you_see the_chefs behind glass
highly_recommended hence
after hearing quite_a_bit about_this_place we_finally decided to_check_it_out
it turns out it's_a_great establishment
you_can't find such_an array_of grilled foods under one roof in_edinburgh as this_place
the_food_is rather spicy_but it compliments the_meat nicely
also_the prices_are_very_reasonable
i_recommend it
damn
this_place_was amazing
the mixed_grill was_so_good i_almost cried
the chicken_wings were the_best chicken_wings i_have_ever_had ever
then_i ordered lamb_vindaloo_and it_was_so tasty_and so frigin spicy i_actually did cry
well done
why is_there no good_indian in america
after passing by ko a gazillion times
finally had_dinner at_the place_for_a friend's farewell
watching from the_outside its brightly lit restaurant
we_usually find_it packed_with people
we must_have decided_to drop in on_an unusually quiet day
service_is slow
which_is disappointing
we_had naan and_tandoori_chicken
pretty_decent
as poor scholars
we_thought the_price_was slightly out_of_a student's budget but_overall
the_portions was_quite sizable
well_priced with a_decent range_of dishes
pretty swift service
the_restaurant_is a_bit draughty though
as noted by earlier reviewers
could also_do with having_the extractor fan in_the gents fitted back into_the plasterboard
a_good_place_to go with_a_group_of mates though so i'd be_happy to_make_a return_visit
oh dear
had_a_really poor meal_here
will_never be_back
the_service_was beyond poor and_it_took an_hour for_the_food_to arrive
when_it finally came it_was_just fine nothing_to_write_home about and_i_was completely underwhelmed
at_one point we_asked a waitress how_much longer it_would_be for_food
no joke
she shrugged her shoulders and_said
i_don't_know
and_that_was it
she_didn't apologise
check with the_kitchen
ask_us if_we_wanted another drink
anything
i burst out laughing at her behaviour and the_guys on_the_table next_to us started a chat about_how long they'd been waiting too
haha
was given_a hokey excuse about the_restaurant being understaffed at the_end_of_the_meal
after we_tried to_pay and had_to_wait another ten_minutes
but honestly the_food_was expensive_for what_it_was and experience very poor
why bother going back again_when so many_other fantastic indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
fail
kebabish
fail
i_have_only collected take away food_from this_restaurant so_i_can't comment on_the serving experience
it's true that_every few_months i_see new faces
assistant waitresses mainly
but_the indian_pakistani guys seem regular to_me
it's considered a_busy place
very spacious and_the customers' origins vary
now
about_the take away food
i've tried all_their biryani dishes and_they're mouth_watering
if_you_live close_by
it's better to_grab the_food_and go home to enjoy_it
as the_price difference is considerable
for example lamb_biryani and peshwari_naan bread for
a_friend_of_mine tried a_spicy lamb_dish and_he loved_it
he's a_curry expert with_his friends trying different restaurant almost per month for_years in_edinburgh
their paratha bread_is also_great lighter in_the stomach compared_to the_naan_bread
it's_easy_to give_them_a call and_order the_food
what_i found unexpected is_that you_will_get text promotions on_your mobile phone every two months or_so and_there's no obvious option to unsubscribe
i_never opted in
so they_seem_to take_it for granted when_you make_a phone order
i_do believe though if you give_them_a call they_should be_able_to remove you from the_list
their punctuality is not_the_best when_ordering take away
they_don't check always how_busy is the_kitchen
and_they mention fixed time mins or_so
but_if_you show up earlier
your_order might be ready
oh
and_they accept card payments for_less_than without any extra charge
looking_forward_to trying more dishes_and_the thrill of the_grill
i_really_love the_food_here there_are loads_of veggie_options and they_all taste great
if_i order an indian_takeaway i_always call here
i've also been_to 'eat in' several_times over the_last couple_of years
only drawback is_that it's usually very quiet
i_guess it's_just that bit further out_of_the centre of_town
just past haymarket
than some folk want_to travel
shame as_the_food is_just fab
food_quality and flavour
stars
service_and environment stars
so what's the_average
i'll be generous
stars
here_it goes
i_remember a_friend_of_mine trying_out this_restaurant with vouchers and highly_recommended it
so_i_decided to_try_it_out with another friend who_has the_taste card
two for_one
he called them quite a_few_times on_the_phone but_there_was no reply
it_was_a surprise looking_at their_website
not updated since
really
on_the plus side their glorious menu_is available at just eat
so_you_can certainly_be interested from there
no
there_is no direct link for their_website to_just eat
i_saw a gentleman going out_with bags for delivery
and_i_think some_people came_in_for take away
there we_go
friday_evening after work
it's raining cats and dogs and_we arrive at_the_restaurant
you_can_have a look_at one_of_the yelp pics
the titles on the_windows look so old to_me
the_waiter is_friendly
letting us choose a_table far_from the_door and_he brings us_the menus immediately
as_we review the_very detailed menu
i notice an ant walking on_the salt jar
i start making mental notes about_my yelp review
my_friend was_more relaxed and removed the ant
and told_me not to_be harsh
well
an_hour later
we_saw another ant walking on_the_wall behind my_friend
we_ordered_the food
ceylon lamb_and vegetarian malayan
both having coconut
with the_second one being sweet as_it includes pineapple
we_were_both so pleased and delighted with_the_food
forcing ourselves to_eat_it slowly to_enjoy more along_with a_tasty garlic_naan_bread
our mixed pakora was_also of great_quality with a_special sweet_and hot_sauce that_made the_difference
my_friend who_has tried lots_of indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh found_it astounding
however it_was another gentleman now serving us
who has_been in_that restaurant for_less_than a_year
as_he told_us
and we_started noticing his difficulties waiting_for the other_tables
there_were big delays for_some of_them from_the time they ordered till they_got the starters
a_couple must_have been waiting_for at least mins
the_guy hadn't manage to_take their order yet
and_they decided_to_go
my advice
if_you're_a big curry fan
you_need to_try_it
if you value more the_service than the_food
you_might want_to think again
personally
i'm planning going_back_to try_more
i've_only had takeaway from_here but_it_is utterly lovely
the_meal deal options_are really very_good value_and you often get extras put_in which_is_nice
delivery is timely and_service over the_phone is_good
the_tikka and passanda are particularly_good
my_son and girlfriend went to_this_restaurant tonight
they_are_not registered users of yelp_and asked_me to_put in_a good word for_the mumbai
they_had the pasanda and_the_lamb rezala
they_said both were_excellent
i enjoyed_my visit_here
i placed my trust in_the helpful waiter to_choose what_i ate
and_was rewarded with_two tasty courses
i'm not_sure the_place_is capable of outstanding culinary fireworks
but_it terms_of reliable
fresh indian_dishes
i_was_very happy_with_the place
overall
we_said
i_was_really pleased with mumbai mansion
i_feel that_i_could go there_again
put my trust in_the waiter's choices
and be_served some_more good dishes
if_you're_in_the neighbourhood
i'd certainly say to_you that it's_worth stopping in to_sample some_of their high_quality dishes
a_nice saturday lunch with_my_husband to mumbai mansion
we_are here fairly frequently and this_time it_is with_a
living_social
discount voucher
i_like_the veggie non spicy options they_have on_the_menu but i_was_a_bit disappointed_that they could_not accommodate my request to_add paneer indian cheese with_my vegetable_korma
even_though_i advised i_was_happy to_pay the_difference in cost
the_staff_are attentive_and the_food_is_very prompt_and tasty
the_restaurant_is spotlessly clean_and well presented
a_nice_touch is_the_place mats that_are done as_the calcutta new paper and_you_can sit and read their news articles which_are humerus
a_great local_indian restaurant_which i_will_be_back to soon no doubt
the prince balti is_out the_way for_me but_it's worth_the_drive
the_food_and staff_are great and_it's_a reasonably_priced night_out if_you_want_to sit it
they_do deliver and_once they've got your address you_will always_get a christmas card
their nan breads are_huge
so take_care
this_is_a fantastic restaurant_and as long_as you_are_not eating on your_own
the_prices will_be very_reasonable too
from sunday thursday
if you_eat in_the_restaurant
they_have_a_great offer where you_can_get_a free meal basically
if_you_order one starter
you_get the_second free and_this applies for mains and_desserts too
when me and_my_friend came_here
it actually worked out_to_be one_of_the cheapest curries that we_have actually_had when_we divided the_cost between us
in terms_of the_quality_of_the_food
it hits all_the right notes too and_i_found that_the papadams were light_and crispy and_the_chicken rogan_josh that_i ordered_was full_of_flavour
with_a good serving_of sauce_to compliment the tender_chicken
the_drink prices_were however
a_bit steep
my_friend paying
for_a can of coke
but_i only_have water_with my_curry so i_didn't_have fork this out fortunately
i_will_definitely_be coming back_and making use_of this great offer soon
nom nom nom
i_haven't eaten_in this_restaurant since_my heady days working the fringe oh cough cough years_ago
this_is_the restaurant where_i discovered chicken korai
a staple in_my menu
and where memories and lasting friendships were fostered
last_night after a_few cheeky beers along the promenade
i
with_friends
retraced my steps to_the prince and tucked into another exemplary meal
vegetable korai works almost as_well as chicken korai
onion bhajis
naan
lemon_rice
all tasted delicious_and_i rolled out_with_a bulbous belly
feeling all was_right with the_world
may your ascendancy to_the throne long continue
prince
this_was_my second_visit after impressed the_first_time
not_disappointed
nice
simple decor where food really stands out
fairly reasonable_price
bindi gosht was_excellent
this_is currently my_favourite indian
well worth_a_visit
this_place_is_great
i'm_not_a local i_was_in edinburgh on holiday
i_am_a curry enthusiast though and i've_eaten in_on three separate continents
i_decided that_i_would do a_curry tour of_edinburgh choose a_different indian_joint every night_and try to_find_the best cross between most flavorful_and spiciest_curry in_the_city
what attracted me_to this_place_was the advertisement that_they serve_the hottest curry available something_that puts even_a vindaloo to shame
so_i headed out_to portobello to_check_it_out
the_atmosphere_was very comfortable and inviting and the_waitstaff extremely_friendly
i_got in_and fund the_prices decent enough
which_is_a perk
and_ordered my mixed_vegetable fal
extra_spicy
as_in more_than it already is
with_rice_and chapati
the waiter_asked several_times if_i knew what_i_was getting into
and_then suggested i_get a_beer to_go along_with it
well
why_not
so_i did
the_food_came_out and_it_was_very aesthetically pleasing
not_to_mention that invigorating aroma
i_went ahead_and tried_it and wow it_was_really flavorful
but_it_wasn't really that spicy
you_must understand that i_eat spicy_food well beyond that of_most human beings
i_eat foods that_i've watched others cry to_taste
i'm_not being egotistical
i'm_just being honest i_like_to get indian_take away back_home and add habaneros and ghost pepper hot_sauce to_it before_i eat_it
so
i sent the fal back to_make_it even spicier
it_still could've been spicier
in_my_book
but_it_was vastly improved and so_i_decided not to_be_a pain
it_was_delicious as any meal could ever be and_i'll look back on_this meal fondly for_a_long_time
finally
my peeps have made_it to_las_vegas
rani's world foods is_an_indian grocery_store chaat stand that_can hold it's own against the mega stores in california and texas
this store has an_amazing array_of indian groceries
frozen foods
produce and_to kick it_up a notch
they_even offer chaat
indian snacks
that are_served up in_their in house kitchen
we_had gone for_their opening today and_it_was_a zoo
way_too many_people and_the lines to_check_out were minutes long
but
i_had_to oppurtunity to peruse their aisles and these_guys have everything an_indian cook home may need or want
pickles
multiple lentil varieties
exotic indian vegetables
flour
spices
everything_was perfectly laid out and_easy to_find
this store is_definitely bigger than any_other_indian store in_las_vegas
it's well lit
well organized and well_stocked
the trifecta
bonus points to_them for_their frozen food selections which_were not unnecessarily marked up_in price something_that the_other indian_grocery stores seem_to be doing that_i frown upon
gopal's for example
crosses out_the manufacturer's suggested price sticker and charges a dollar or_two more
these_guys don't
at least not yet
i_haven't_had a_chance_to taste their chaat offerings as today was free food_for all_and so_the lines were_out_of control
i_hope to_have_a follow up report some_time soon
an_indian store in_las_vegas that rivals wal mart
wow
never thought i'd live to_see_this day
this was_a_little tricky to_find
as i_visited at_night and_their sign was_not lit up
even during_the day
i pass this all_the_time and_have_never seen it it_was_only by the_good grace of yelp that_i heard_of rani's at_all
this_is_a very_clean
spacious and modern_indian market
they_are well_stocked with all_of_the usual things
spices
pulses
frozen foods
pickles
biscuits
etc
their produce section is inviting and_well laid out_with those little water sprayers above that keep the_vegetables fresh
there's_also a deli counter with hot snacks and sweets
attended by very_sweet ladies who also prepare all_the foods
the_veg pakoras_were really_nice
also_the besan ka ladoo
a subtle sweet flavored by cashew
so_yummy
finally
it_was satisfying to_see_the modern cash_register with_its big screen where you_can keep tabs on all_of_the prices as_they ring up
it irks me in_other small markets where_you just kind of have_to trust the cashier to not_make mistakes
a_big thank_you to my_fellow yelpers for helping me find_this great_place
the_place_is_clean and_very organized and_it_was nice to_be_able_to find everything we_needed easily
they_also have serve food
different_types_of chaat and_other snacks as_well as mithai
the_lady running the_food section is_extremely sweet and_welcoming
we_went_to order bhel_puri and_she offered_us pakoras from_a fresh hot batch she_had just fried
i_should never go_to_the grocery_store when hungry cause i_ended_up also ordering a_samosa chat
the_portions_are huge and_i_was full after_eating some_of_the bhel
also
they_have free tea which_is_great
i_was also impressed_with their customer orientation
the_guy at the_cash_register mentioned alternatives to_some stuff we_had bought
he even replaced a cauliflower we_had chosen stating that_it didn't_look very_good
i_will_definitely_go again even though its_a distance from home
first_off
read my review_for new india market
which is_in_the next complex over
now come_back_to rani's world foods
yeah
the_difference is ridiculous
this store is_much larger
cleaner
the_staff_is much nicer
the_selection_of products is_better
most_importantly
the pricing is_always consistent
the_prices don't constantly change
and almost_everything is_clearly marked with_a price tag
the_price isn't up_to_the person at the_cash_register at_that very moment
everyone pays the_same_price
also
they_have fresh_food as_well
and_it_is amazing
plenty of shopping carts
so_you_can load up_on all your_indian groceries
produce and whatnots
you'll be on_your merry way in no_time at_all
great selection_of_indian prayer items
teas
spices
pots
pans and_the like
also
if_you_like marmite
vegemite or_any of_that stuff
you_can get_it here
hop to_it
what_is a_better way_to shop than drinking free tea
don't sit here_and read my_review
do yourself the favor of jumping in_the car and going over there_to see_what it's all_about
the_people that run the_store
sorry i_forgot the_guys name
and_the mom grandmom esk indian woman in_the_back cooking samosas just totally embody what_we are_all looking_for when_we walk into a_place for_the_first_time
try_this
taste that
have a_cup_of tea dear
bring_your friends
bring_your family
grab_a cart and_go on_an excursion
take_your time
this_place_is sweet_and so are the_people running it
my knowledge of indian_foods is unfortunatly minimal
i_have_to confess
but
i've been_wanting_to learn more
getting a_few cookbooks and familiar_with things i_want_to try
a_total novice
but_with rani's world foods
i'm well on_my way_to being an expert
yes
this place_is_clean
bright
inviting and omg
when_you_walk into the_front doors
the intoxicating smell_of exotic spices_and deliciousness just hit you like_a brick wall
i_was_in love
the_spice selection totally floored me
i_mean
i'd only read about asfodita
and now_i know_where to_buy it
i_want_to be_a_bit different_than all_the_other glowing posts rani's has here
all about_the_food
which_is wonderful
but
all_about_the really unique hair products
i_never knew there was_such_a thing as jasmine hair oil
untill seeing_the vast selection at rani's
these oils are mainly coconut based
with jasmine extract for gorgeous fragrance
some will_have other natural ingredients for added benefits
i_picked out
one_was specifically for color treated hair like_i possess
after using my blow dryer to style my hair
i use a_small amount of_this in_my palm
and glide it_down the hair shaft
the results are fantastic
with_the best_part_is it's not_greasy
i_was_expecting my hair to_look limp and nasty as the_day went_on
but_it stays soft_and shiny all_day
plus
it's_very inexpensive to boot
the_small bottle
the_large bottle
for color treated hair
i'm sold on_this stuff
we recently fell into an affair with_indian_food
if_they cook_it
we_have will eaten eat_there
it led to_a search_of cookbooks with_many spices i_had_no clue where to_find locally
a_little search on_yelp popped up this little_gem that meets both my eating and cooking wants
the_bf and_i_ate at the_food booth in_the_back and shared a_vegetarian thali
comes_with dishes among several choices
dal
rice
pickles
bread
samosa chat
i_believe
and_a paneer stuffed paratha w yogurt
it_was plenty of_food_for two and_all very_nice
i_am a_big_fan_of the_samosa chat here though
the chutneys_were fresh_and vibrant and_kept me going_for more
there_is_a water cooler and_a hot tea dispenser that_is complimentary but there_is_also various drinks in_the fridge area
if_you're_in_the area_and want a_tasty snack or a_nice veggie meal
definitely drop in
grocery side has everything_we were_looking_for
they_have also some_more common spices_that i_decided_to get here_as the_prices_are really_good
for example
i_almost bought_a jar of cinnamon sticks at the_grocery and_it's
for_the_same amount here
a_nice sized jar of_spices start are mostly about
with_the harder to_find spices like green cardamom pods are around
very few are over that
for_those who need spices_in mass quantities
they_have huge value bags as_well_and they_seem to_be_a better deal than buying at sams costco
i_also hoped i_can find_some fresh herbs and_they indeed had fresh curry leaves and_fresh fenugreek
if_you're_not into_the cooking stuff
there_are_plenty_of tasty_and interesting looking snacks and prepared packs of_food
we bought a_few heat and_eat packets and_some were_good_and some not
i_suppose it's hit and miss
but_hey
it's packet food_and isn't anything like_the fresh
eat
cook and_be merry
my_husband_and_i drove by rani's a_couple weeks_ago and_he_said
international market
that looks interesting
so_i made_a note to_check_it_out on_yelp later
after_reading_the reviews i channeled liz lemon and exclaimed
vegetarian indian_food
i_want_to go_to there
so that_is how_we wound up_at rani's
i immediately went_to_the counter and_ordered a_thali and_paneer paratha
i'm_a sucker for paneer
and_the cute lil lady behind the_counter proceeded_to give_me an_indian sweet to_have while_i waited
she_brought out our thali
which consisted_of roti
rice
dal
pickles
okra
an aloo_gobi type yumminess
and_i_believe kofta
veggie dumplings
the cute lil lady was feeling generous_and also gave_us_a tomato_soup with paneer in_it
definite bonus points
everything_was fantastic
although i_was_expecting a_little_more paneer flavor to_my paratha
this_place_is very casual
which i_really_like about_it
don't come_in expecting the_same food that_you would_get at_a sit down indian_restaurant
instead
expect the_kind_of food_you would_get if you_were invited to_a grandma's kitchen
after_we filled our bellies
we wandered through_the aisles of_the immaculately clean grocery_store
i_hadn't planned on buying anything
but_when_i found garam masala for super cheap
and black salt that_i_had been_looking_for everywhere and_couldn't find
and_a giant bag of arrowroot powder for_a_couple bucks
normally for a_tiny jar anywhere else
well you_get the picture
anything you_would need for_a well_stocked indian pantry is here
and_then some
there's_also mint and_tamarind sauces
bottled lassis
naan
and huge blocks of_paneer
trust_me when_i say_i seriously considered buying all_the above to snack on at_home
i considered giving_this place_stars
because we_went_back a_couple days later and_the_food_was cold_and missing that extra special love like we_had_the first_time
but_it_was_a friday_evening and_there_was an_indian soap opera on the_tv i_think_we interrupted
so
obviously
i_can't blame them
the_store
stumbled onto this_place while_i_was in_vegas_for a_month
has a_great_selection_of indian_spices
groceries et al
name it_and i_think_they have_it
was_very very_impressed_with their well maintained space and_selection
the cafe
aaah
don't you miss_the parathas
great aloo and gobi parathas
i_am_a fan
the_lady behind the_counter here
very_warm and_welcoming
very reminiscent_of grandma
will tell you all that's laid out is home_made and lovingly made
it sure does taste good
don't_forget_to wrap up a_selection_of sweets
the kala jamun is yummmm
the pickles are_great too
don't_let_the unassuming outer appearance fool_you
it is_a_great_place_to stumble upon
love the_food_and_service
one_of_the cleaner indian_grocery shops i've_been_to
clean deli
the_food_in their deli is_excellent
you_can taste_the freshness
even the_chana
chickpeas
are fresh_and not canned
and on_top_of it they_have_a_great selection_of_indian and british groceries
wow
i read_the_reviews and_decided_to check_it_out
this_place_is so cool
amazing selection_of_indian goods
especially sauce mixes
the_food counter
omg
tried_the paneer_and the_basmati_rice
the_rice_was better_than a_number_of the sit down indian_restaurants_i've_been_to and the_paneer had_a_great texture_and flavor
the_price_was way_better too
the_little cart of kulfi was_also wonderful
a_complete meal_for half_of what_i_would pay at a_regular restaurant
yay
food counter review
thali price alert
thali price alert
the_thali is no_longer
it_is
there has_been a increase
so_i told my whole team that_it_was only
for a_plate_of vegetarian ethnic yumminess
based_on_the yelp_reviews
when_we_arrived
i_noticed that_the where_it was_supposed_to_be
it_was covered with a_piece_of paper with
written on_it
boo
i_gave false information to_my whole team
nonetheless
we_all had thali
the_sweet little lady took precious time
a_bit_slow for_our liking since we_had_to get_back to_work
to prepare each tray with whatever she want_to put_on it
my tray consisted_of the_following
mashed spinach
doesn't look appetizing
but tasted ok
i_only ate a_few bites of_this
eggplant curry
was_delicious_and tasty
i finished this
squash something
i finished this too
it_was_very refreshing
tofu something
was_decent
but_not as flavorful
there were_three cubes_of tofu in_this compartment
basmati_rice with_peas the_rice taste good
purple onion slices with spicy mango sauce
this was_supposed_to_be the pickle veg on_the_menu
well
it_doesn't really taste_like it_would sound
we_all thought the_sauce tasted like pinesol
we_didn't touch this on_our tray
roti
tasted like tortilla
i_should_have asked_for paratha
the milk tea_and purified water_was complimentary
i give_this a_star
grocery_store review
my co_worker picked up a_bag of naan_and a_bottle_of lychee drink from the_grocery side
when_she was_about to_pay_for it_and flipped over_the bag of_naan
those visible naans_were moldy blue in color
the_guy that_was about_to ring it_up took it_and throw it away
people
make_sure_you inspect the goods before making_a purchase
sometimes
we tend_to not look_at it until_we are_about to enjoy_the_food
i give_this a_star
overall
star place
decided_to_go for_lunch at rani's after_reading all_the five_star reviews at yelp
the_food_was_great
as_good as home_cooked indian_food
great customer_service
i've been eying this_place_for_a while
since_i don't live too far_from here
the rainbow on_the sign always catches my eye when_i drive_by because i_love rainbows
i situated in_a corner in_a_strip_mall
this store looks smallish from the_outside
when_i_walked in i_was genuinely surprised
this_place_is_a legit grocery_store
they_even_have a_fresh produce section
which_i really wasn't expecting
i_came_here looking_for some garam masala for the_chicken_makhani dish a pakistani friend of_mine said i_must cook
i_couldn't find_this spice at_my normal haunts
so upon recommendation from the_guys at trader joes i_went_to rani's
i_found a plethora of ethnic spices
and_the garam masala_was easy_to locate
i_even got_some pineapple jam
which i'm excited_about trying
the_customer_service wasn't all too friendly
and_when_i paid_for my items
the_lady intentionally did_not give_me the coin part_of my change
perhaps that_was her tip
ok
so_it_was only_a_few pennies
but it_really tripped me_out the_way she_didn't even attempt to give_me the_change
she only handed me_the dollars and_then walked away
well ok
ms
thang
anyway
if you're searching_for hard_to find ethnic spices from all_over_the world
then_i recommend coming_here
maybe i'll come_back_and try_the_lunch counter next_time
you're now reading a review_of rani's by_the duke of rani's
yes
the_long road to dukedom was finally achieved today with_my
nd check_in
how did y'all let this happen
okay maybe not everyone else_is glued to_their iphone as_much_as_i am to_try to check_in as often
but_still
first_and nd visit i_got_the thali
both_times the_service_was extremely pleasant
though this nd time_the woman working the_counter sort of forgot about my_order and_served the_next party first
wasn't_too big of a_deal and_she seemed apologetic
i_love_the ordering checkout process
as both_times it evolved into some_sort_of old school bartering system
always in_my favor
me
i'll take_a smart water too
grabs
bottle from_the fridge
her
just give_me a dollar
deal
almost convinced that if_i wandered in_there with nothing but cents to_my name
i'd somehow walk out_with_a full stomach
don't try_this kids
onto_the food
i have_no_idea what_the proper names are of_what_i ate either time
the_first_time_i just waited_for the woman
rani
to_make my_plate
and then_i devoured most_of_it
didn't_care_for the_onions as_i noticed someone else mention
and i_also_had some cold chickpea dish that_day that wasnt appeasing to_me
everything else
rice
dal
roti
some tofu thing
was_delicious
this_time another woman
not rani
actually showed me all_the different options_for the_thali
i_heard her mention buttermilk and_cheese in a_few_of them so_i simply requested that_i not_have anything with milk or cheese and_she happily obliged
i_ended_up with_a dish_with chickpeas
one with red beans
an eggplant one
the_rice
and those onions
grrrrr
and some_sort_of hot pickle pepper thing
loved_it all except the_onions
now go beat me for_this duke title
i_don't deserve it_with only visits
i_had rani's bookmarked forever
and i_finally made_it down here_to actually do some grocery shopping
well
my_mom did some grocery shopping
i kinda fail at_the learning to_cook my ethnic food
but enough_of that
i_went and met rani and she's awesome
she reminds me basically of every single indian grandma
they stuff you full_of food_to show their affection
my_only qualm is_that_the food isn't next level spicy
when_i want_to_eat chaat
i wanna feel like_my intestinal lining is being seared off
but_hey
i_know she's catering to both indian_and non_indian palates
so i'll let it slide
but_this is_a_great_place_to come when_i'm missing some homemade food
great_vegetarian food_with excellent spices
this_is owned by_a local family
very_polite_and friendly place
by no means will rani be the_first_place i_think of for_indian_cuisine
the_plates have a_decent variety_of_dishes
but_nothing spectacular
today's thali platter consisted_of a saag
lentils
and_a paneer dish with_onions
rice
and pickles
i_enjoyed_the saag because_of_the hints of ginger
but the_other items_were mediocre
i_ended_up dabbing my bread off_with napkins before bites due_to how_much oil was on_them
everything_else_was forgettable though
the vegetable_samosas were_delicious
they_were predominantly potatoes with_peas
the chutneys_were refreshing and_flavorful
dipping these golden pockets in_the_sauce made_for good eats
the_mango_lassi_was the_other highlight of_the_meal
it_was_not too_sweet and_had_a robust taste ripe mangoes
this_place_is_great
i_didn't realize there_was_a food stand inside
but glad_i found_out
this_is right_next_to zia records and_they sell all types_of indian_spices you usually can't find anywhere else
the_lady behind the_food counter is_very_nice_and after visit they recognized me and_even knew what_i liked to_eat
the_food_is all made_fresh and_has the home feel taste to_it
this_place_is better_than most restaurants out_there and_much cheaper too
we bought a_large sized portion_of the beans and_it lasted for_days
they_also provide free tea which usually cost in restaurants
the_good thing_is it's very_close_to mt
everest
our favorite_indian_restaurant
if you wanted to_eat out
good
friendly_service
loved_it this_is_one_of_the nicest indian markets i_have_been_to
i_will_be shopping here regularly
there_are even size choices on bags of flour and_rice
back_home there_was_only one size
clean_and bright
fresh mehindi is_in_the fridge here as_well
third time
for_the
thali to_go
also_ordered veggie_samosas
guess what
no onions this_time
one_of_the_best_indian meals i've ever_had
no joke
all from_the comfort of my_office and_for or_so with the_samosas_and a giant bottle_of smart water
seemed_like i_got a_lot_more food_when getting it to_go as_well
interesting development
seriously i'm blown_away right_now
huge heapings of dal
curries
and_veggies and_a gigantic portion_of rice_for
the stretch of sahara between samosa_factory
rani's and mt_everest is_all i_need in_my_life
homey feel so_tasty home style food
which_is good on stomach
since_it's homey style
if_you_go later in_the night
they_will just reheat and serve
had tried the_food times_in our recent trip_to_vegas
dhahi vadai is_not thayir vadai
it_was terrible
keep doing north_indian foods only
south_indian is_not your strength
if_you_want_a good thayir vadai
fly to sfo
there_are_plenty_of south_indian_food here
other_than_that their paratha's and thali are_good
bhel is also_good
old lady is like_your grandma
mostly a_nice lady
but speaks one indian language only
so_if_you dont speak that language
you_are at mercy with_her english
we_had an altercation with_her
because she couldn't understand our english
though
it_got cleared
she_was still upset and started being erratic to_us
so_we_were little upset
i_could_have gone there_again
but one_of_our friend referred india_masala in rivera
which_was convenient and_good
stars_because every_time_i come_in here to_satisfy my gulab_jamun craving
the_owners_are extremely_friendly
i_like_to buy my chutneys and_lentils here
as_well as_some frozen veggies
but_the one_thing_i am never without from_this_place are the_fresh roasted peanuts in_their produce section
i_don't_know_what makes them so addicting
but you_really must_try them
omg
everyone i offer them_to wants_to know_where i buy them
i'm not_a_fan_of their hot_food section
maybe it_was because_the one_time i_tried_it
it_was near closing and_everything just seemed old_and dried out
plus
it_looked a_bit dirty
maybe i_will_try again_when things are fresher earlier in_the day
but_this_is a_fun place_to discover new spices_and sauces
if_you_have ever_been_to india's sweets and_spices in southern california
then you_will feel right at_home here
this_is_a terrific indian market that also includes fresh produce for sale
it_is_the one place_in_town where_i know_i can_find real fresh bitter melon
they_also_have_a wonderful restaurant_in_the store where if_you_don't know what_it_is you_can simply point to_what loks good to_you
as far_as raw goes not_much in_that arena in indian_cooking
but_if_you_are okay with traditional_indian vegetarian fare this_is_the spot_for it in_las_vegas
they_always offer free chai_tea and_the woman chef who runs the_place could not_have_been nicer
what_a_great smile
and you_know
that smile gets translated into the_food
love rani's
the_reason for_the trip_to rani's was_that a_friend_who lived nearby was_looking_for some special seasonings for a_special dish_to prepare
i_decided i_wouldn't mind going_on a field trip and possibly discover some treats that_were new to_me
neither one of_us_had lunch yet and_were delighted to_find that_they_had a_little restaurant inside
yay
a in
seeing that_it_was_a new store to_the both_of_us and_how we_love to peruse international markets for hidden gems we combed the_place
no aisle was overlooked
no shelf was neglected
we searched high and low for_any and_everything
he found the_spices that_he was_looking_for
the shelves were well_stocked and_the_place_was nice and_clean
the_place_is obviously cared for in_that respect
i_did notice that things_were higher priced here compared_to what i_have_seen in_other international markets around_town
that_was a_bit_of_a disappointment
by_the_time_we were_all set to purchase there_was no_one at the_cash_register
we looked around and_only saw other customers doing their shopping
we_saw the bell by the_register area_and rang it once
the cashier came quickly_and rang us up
she_didn't greet
she_didn't say anything actually
she just held out her hand for_the money_and practically threw the_change at my_friend
i_thought_it_was quite rude
we_tried to ignore it as_we_were plenty hungry by this_time and_wanted_to get down_to the grub
we_made our_way to_the
restaurant
area
there_was already a_few people in_line
we_got in behind them as_we tried_to decide what_we would_order
the_food that finally came_to them did_not look appetizing
everything looked_like leftovers just slopped on picnic ware
it_seemed to_be taking an extraordinary amount of_time for preheated food_to_be served
we decided_to_go across_the_street to_find some lunch
i_won't_be returning to_this_place
with_the overpriced groceries and poor_service
it_is enough_to keep_me away
compared_to a typical_indian grocery_store
this_place_is very_clean_and organized
all_the isles are properly marked and_doesn't smell like_a temple
mixed smell_of about mil incense sticks
kitchen looks very_clean_and some_great items_on_the_menu with close_to homemade taste
their inhouse sweets are just_ok but_they_are fresh
not frozen for a_week shipped from ny or chcago
my_only issue here_is service
the_lady at_the_front cash_register is_so rude
i_don't_even go inside the_store because if her
absolutely no greeting
no smile and if_you_ask her a question
lets just_say you'll regret_it
edit
service_has somewhat improved and_i feel the_review should be changed a_bit
changing from start_to till my_next_visit
keep up the_good work
anyways
here_are my very accurate ratings
cleanliness
organized
variety
food kitchen
service
location parking
i_thought_this place was_kind_of hard_to find as most_places on_sahara are for_some_reason
i_went_here specifically to_buy some vatika oil for_my hair
the product itself_was not hard_to find at_all since all_of_the hair products are literally the aisle right behind the_register when_you_walk into the_store
they're always fully stocked and_the clerks are_nice
rani's was my_first_visit to_an international food market so i_was_a_little nervous that nobody would speak english for_some_reason
perhaps an ignorant assumption
but_i've had_good experiences here
i_thought_that las_vegas would_not have_an international food market and_i_would have_to_go online to_buy my vatika oil but i_did_not
i'm very_pleased
i_would call this a_hidden_gem
probably_not as big as_some stores you'd find in_nyc but_i_don't_think that_would_be a_fair comparison
the_first person you_see as you_walk_in
is_this lady cashier
who seems miffed she does not greet you or say hello and_when you_get past her
you notice an older man and_he is_also miffed
then_you realize this man is the_owner
who_has set_the trend and tone for_this_place
every one in_this_place looks like they_just woke up and_no_one has a_smile and_all they they_have_a demeanor of personnel in_a funeral parlor
the older man serves the_food_and then when_you_are ready to_check_out
the_same man is_at the_cash_register
it_is obvious that_they_are oblivious to the_health department regulations or they_just don't_care
couple_of helpers
a man and woman
who_are toiling and tormenting in_the_kitchen
seems_to be taken advantage_of their servitude and_they_are clearly overworked and_it shows
the_old man walks around like he_is pissed off at something and in_fact
everyone seems_to be pissed off
also the_same lady who did_not greet you_will take_your money like she is_a gestapo agent and you_have_to watch the_bill closely
since she does some tricks with the_prices that surly does not match the_price on the_grocery as mentioned in the_reviews before
i_also agree_with one reviewer who spent and_had_to change a note for_three cents change
in fairness the_food_is decent
but_they buy salt from morton's wholesale
if_i want good_indian_food i_would_go to_the newly opened india_masala buffet_on east flamingo with_both north and south_indian_food and_over items for the_same_price these zombies are charging and_you_can gulp it down_with a_glass_of red_wine and_not have_the
tension
and unwelcome attitude as here
as_far the groceries i noted fungus on_the pita breads
when_i brought it_to_the attention of the_old man
he shrugged it_off and put_it right back in_the bin
i_had_to buy it_and throw it away than risk someone get sick
this alone is_a reason not_to shop at_this_place
they want_to make money and_they don't_care if_you_get sick with_a fungus and drop dead
a man is judged by how he treats his own countrymen
by that standard
this_is_a scum of_the earth cheapskate who should_not be_in hospitality business
one has_to_be devoid of_any self respect and desperate to shop here
since you and_your money is parted not with a_smile but by_a stern looking svengali
i_would_not eat or shop here even_if this was_the_only place_in_town
not_sure why many_of_the posters give_it_a low rating
i_loved_the store
the_people and_the fresh_food
the_free_chai didn't spoil the fun either
check_it_out folks
but don't_expect white glove service
after_all it_is_an indian grocery_store
however
i_thought_it_was a_great_place compared_to_other_indian stores here_and in_other cities
tip
in_the_back
do ask_them for what's fresh off the_kitchen_and try_it
if they_have
mirchi bajji
fresh
it_is_a must_have with the_free_chai
the_food_here_is amazing
just_like grandma would_make it in_india
paranthas are really_good
this_place_is neat and_clean
simple food cooked home style
i_usually stop_by the_kitchen area_and get the_thali to_go
last_time_i went
i_forgot to_tell the_person putting the_food_on my tray that_i wanted_it to_go until she_had already put the_rice_and item on_a tray
she said
i_would_have put_it in containers if you_had told_me earlier
and_she just continued to_put it onto_the flat tray
she then foil wrapped the tray but_i_had to_do my minute drive home making sure to_take corners slowly
the bottom_line is_that_the staff need to_take_a little extra time to_do things properly
at no_time should a_server say in essence
i_would_have done things properly but
they_seem a_little understaffed and_the_staff appear to be_a_bit undertrained
overall
i_still like coming_here because_they have_a_good variety_of_indian groceries and_the_food_is good_but customer_service definitely needs to_improve
the food_you_get is closest to mom home_cooked indian_food
stars_for food
the complementary tea could_be better
my_friend is_a die hard rani's fan
so_he dragged me from_my strip hotel so_we_could eat pani puri and chaat at_this hole in_the_wall restaurant tucked_away in_the_back of_an_indian grocery_store
the_store itself seemed a_bit disorganized and_the_staff not super_friendly
not_like i_expected great_service though
but the_food_was_delicious
we_started_with_the papdi chaat which_was_delicious
one_thing_i noted with this_dish which_is different than_most papdi chaat dishes i've_eaten in_the_past is_that_the papdi was_extremely crispy as though they_made these just_for our_order
the pani puri was_also delicious_and_the chutneys are_amazing
if_you're_in vegas and_want_to get_away from_the_strip and try_some local
non hotel
food
check out rani's
i_like rani's
i've_only been_there once
but_i will_be_going back
soon
actually
i'm running low on tea
we_had heard_about rani's from_a_friend who_is big into international food
i_love_indian_food
and_indian culture
so going_to_this store has_been on the_list for_a_while
one_day
i decided_that i_needed to_find dabur amla oil for_my hair
i_used_to use_it back_home in chicago
and it_really helped me_with a_number_of issues i_had with_my hair
detangling
for_one
i_called rani's and_the gentlman on_the_phone was very_polite_and helpful
we_went_in and i_found_the oil right away
and_they_had a_huge selection_of it_too
we looked around at_the groceries
and i_was_pretty impressed
they_have_a really good_selection_of spices
and teas
they_have huge boxes of pg tips
which_is my tea of_choice
i_used_to get_it at fresh and_easy
but_then i_tried_the international market over on decatur
which_was cheaper
well
rani's has it cheaper than_that
they_also have bollywood dvds for cents
i'm_going_to have_to brush up_on my bollywood cinema and_pick up a_few
i_used_to buy and rent bollywood movies all_the_time back_home
honestly
being_in rani's brought_me back a_bit
i_found and bought a_little bottle_of lychee juice
something i_hadn't been_able_to find_in the almost years i've_lived here
we_also_tried a_samosa from_the_kitchen
and the_free_chai
both were_really_good
d
i_can't_wait_to_go_back
d
this gastro gem instantly connects me with_my former lifetime
s
in_india
rani dishes up_some sumptuous home style food_at_the back counter
with_the love of_a dotting grandmother
the tangy and_fresh chutneys accompany her rich_and flavorful veg fare perfectly
her pakoras are_a hearty treat
and one_of_the_few deep_fried foods i'll indulge in
because how_can you say no to_your adopted indian grandmother
the_rest_of_the store is_a delectable journey through spice
i_can easily lose track of earthly time_here
to_my less traveled western epicurians
know this_is_not like_the international isle at whole foods
expect
hindi tv
ghee scented air
tables sticky with chai resin
and dusty nag champa boxes to abound
all part_of_the authenticity and_love that_is rani world
i_recently read that india does irradiate their spices like we_do in_the west
so buying indian spice products are_both cost health effective
but do check expiration dates
my staples from these illustrious isles include
star anise
tumeric
chana besana flour
rose water
peppered pampadams
yellow split mung beans
aspativa
basmati_rice
mustard seed
cinnamon bark
ghee and_the beauty of_fresh curry leaves from_the produce section
i_love love love_indian_food_and this_place_is_the best place_in_town to vegetarian variety
i_actually grew up not_to far_from this grocery cafe but_i never knew until a_recent trip_to the adjacent zia records that_the market also sold food_and boy do i_wish_i_could kick myself_and go_back in time lol the_food_is_so flavorful_and i_recommend_the potato parartha and_pretty much anything else on_the_menu
i_can't stress enough how fantastic the_food_is
update
i_went_back here_about two weeks_ago to_pick_up a_big box of tea
they_were_closed
so
my_friend_and_i were_going_to get_back in_the car to_go kill time till they_opened
the older woman who runs the_kitchen knocked on_the glass and motioned for_us_to come_in
she opened an_hour early for_us
that_is grade a service
the young lady who rang us up commented about me making
a_cup
of tea in_a joking manner
so_we joked a_little
but_then i_said how pg tips is_my_favorite
and_she and_the older woman made conversation with_me about_how its their favorite too
so personable
and spectacular
i_cant speak highly enough about_this food store
i discovered_this_place when_my boyfriend's sister moved in
apparently they_have_a location in california she frequented
buy
spicy cashews
they_are absolutely_amazing
if_you_like nuts
i sure do
and anything spicy
you_will absolutely_love these things
lentils
the_most affordable place i_have_found to_buy them in_town
indian_spices
if_you_are learning how to_make indian_food
this is_a_great_place_to buy prepackaged spices_that make making curries as easy as making hamburger helper
the_staff here is_very_friendly_and helpful
i personally wouldn't buy my produce here
some_of it_looks kind of old
everything else_is wonderful_and affordable
they carry henna and amla products for coloring the hair naturally
although i_felt_like they watched me the_first couple_of_times i_came_in
they_are always friendly_and answer questions if_you_ask
the_smell_of the_spices through the_store is_delicious
the_owner runs the_kitchen_and let us taste everything
it_was_delicious
we_ended_up eating lunch there
will_be_back_for more
the_food seemed overly salty_and lacking_in spiciness i_had_the thale
and i_thought_the potatoes_in the_aloo metha were_a_bit under cooked
the_food_was also a_bit watery
i_wanted vegan
and_the_staff made_some suggestions which_i took
very_tasty
very_helpful and friendly_staff too
unfortunately
for_me
i_wouldn't know_how_to order se
asian vegan_dishes
so_i_have to_ask_for suggestions
but_the suggested dish
es
were_tasty and varied
the_staff helpful_and friendly
and_other diners friendly as_well
this_is_a no frills section_of a supermarket with maybe small tables
free chai_tea
and_i_was stuffed for_under
i adore this charming little store food spot
not_only can i_find a_lot_of ethnic items here
but the_food_is_amazing
you_can taste_the home_cooked love_that goes into each_dish
it's indian_food_at its best_and you_can't beat the_prices
love_this_place
the_food_is_delicious_and very_fresh
i_took_my meat eating husband_and he_loved it
i_am_a part time meat_eater who loves vegetarian_dishes_and this is_the_place_to_go if_you_love food_with spice
i_really could_eat about a_dozen of_the veggie_samosas
the_mint_chutney is_delicious_and i_will be_back_for_more roti_and aloo
i_love spices_and rani has plenty
so_for all_you cooking folks
this_is_the_place
i've_been_to their houston
tx location and_now las_vegas
next stop california and_i've yet_to be_disappointed
went_back_for more veggie_samosas they_were_so good
hot_and crispy
i_am in_love_with the_mint_chutney
first_and foremost it's an_indian grocery_store and_everything about_it is_super indian in_every way
rani
the_owner_is as_indian as_one can_get and she's a delightful character
just don't_expect american customer_service from her or her staff
groceries are_plenty and diverse
and her food_is authentic_and delish
the_free_chai is_hard_to beat
i_love_it
it reminds of_the scene back_home
i_just came_back from_india and_kept craving real indian_food
i_found_it at rani's
paneer
samosas
barfi all_were real good and_authentic
the_prices_are also almost_like in_india lol
their selection of_spices_and dahlia is_also_very impressive
this_is_my_favorite store now
forget the_whole foods
when_we_went to_vegas
we_had planned on daily trips driving to places around vegas
and_so we_wanted a_place where_we could_get food_on_the go_and start_with our drive
came across rani's world foods with_a google search and_it couldn't have_been any better
we_didn't shop at_the grocery_store but the_food_and_service at the_kitchen was_so_good and the_cost reasonable that we_decided_to stop_by and_get our_food for_the_next days and_even for_dinner
the_lady in_the_kitchen
rani
is_the_best
highly_recommended
where else can you_get two aisles devoted to lentils
a cricket bat
and get_a_good lunch and_drink for_under
not_too many_places is_the answer
this_place
fortunately
is one_of_them
a slice of_indian_food groceries and a_bit_of english tea
and_a competent lunch counter add up_to a delightful little_place to shop
and sit and watch the videos while you're at it
order two samosa's
which_are generously sized
and maybe_a smattering of_veggie pakora_and top_it off_with the_free_chai tea
then sit down at_their rickety tables_and get transported to_a strange little piece_of indian culture in_the form_of crazy
whacky indian pop culture dance videos
that alone is worth_the_trip
i_can't_speak of anybody else
but_my politeness was met with politeness and the_counter girl is_a charmer
the_old lady everyone talks of went grin for grin with_me
so_i'm calling that_a win
bottom_line is_that_it_is an experience_and a_great_place_to stockpile indian_food supplies
so go eat
shop
and watch the videos
and_since you get_away so cheap
don't_forget_to tip
great parathas
a_little_pricey
the_service could_be better
but
going into an_indian fast_food place
i_had_a very low expectation
the_place wasn't_so clean
but oh_well
the_food made_up_for_it
we_went_back three_times during_our days trip_to_vegas
i_like_the authentic homemade indian_food_and free indian tea here
also i_like_to buy fresh okra and_super sweet yellow mango
stopped here_to pickup snacks on_our way_to ca
the_store carries almost_everything desired from_a super indian grocery_store snacks
staples
vegetables
fruits and exotic items
the_great surprise was_their mini restaurant
that offered wide collection of sweets and snacks
i_highly_recommend their thali
it_is closest to_the home_cooked
north
indian_meal i_had in_the_us
i_live in_nyc
so_that's a_major compliment
visit_this_place with huge bags and empty stomach
and carry_out as_much as your body
bags and car can carry
if_you_love indian_food_you will love_this_place
its_a brand new_restaurant that everyone should try
its in_a beautiful building with an_amazing menu
i_had_the tandoor chicken_wings
reshmi kabob
and_some cheese_naan
it_was_all amazing
it_was spicy_but_not over powering
it_was_like my_taste_buds went_to disneyland and didnt want to_come_back
my_friend from_india was_also with_me and she_was glad_to finally find_an authentic_indian_food restaurant_in_the north west part_of_town
so if_you_want_to take you taste_buds to disneyland too give saffron a_try
long time lurker on_yelp but finally writing my_first review on_a well deserving place
beautifully decorated restaurant_and very_accommodating staff
the_owner raj recommended_the chicken_pakora appetizer for_our year old son since he can't handle anything spicy
it_was_so tasty that i_had_to refrain from eating his dinner
we_ordered_the lamb_vindaloo_and chicken_madras both extra_spicy
both entrees were_fantastic but_the chicken_madras was_the winner of_the_two and_will_be our staple dish every_time_we visit
the_garlic and_cheese naan_were a_must to mop up every last drop of our_entrees
they_do_have a_lunch_buffet which i_look_forward_to trying many of_their offerings
but i_can_see having dinner_here on_a_regular_basis
this is_by_far_the_best indian_restaurant_in_town
really great_place
we_had dinner_there tonight and sadly had the_place_to ourselves
however
unlike a_lot_of places_that just seem_to
give up
when they_don't_have a_lot_of business on_a particular night
the_staff at saffron seemed_to be working extra hard for_our approval
our hostess waitress was_very_friendly_and accommodating
ensuring that_we_had everything we_needed without hovering
the food_was_absolutely excellent as_well
my_husband_had a_lamb_dish
which_he ordered medium_spicy
while i_had_the mattar_paneer at no_spice
both_of ours was_delicious_and seasoned perfectly
they_don't seem_to fall into_the trap that
more spice more_flavor
that_i_have encountered at_some places where a
actually equals
nuclear reactor in_your_mouth hot
now_that i_know they_have_a fine hand at spices
i_may actually order a_little heat next_time
we also_got the_cheese_naan
which i_highly_recommend
tender
filled_with just_enough cheese to_add flavor_and texture without making_it greasy
their_menu_is just long enough_to give_you lots_of options but_not so_long that_it's overwhelming
it_has_a huge vegetarian section
with_lots_of choices_for even_the pickiest eater
long story short
we_will_be_back
hopefully next_time it_will_be full to_the rafters busy
i_do_not like_indian_food
that_is
until_i tried_this_place
they changed my_mind about the_cuisine and_i'm thankful for_that
since this_place_is literally around_the_corner
i_finally decided_to_give_it_a try one_night while having nowhere else to go_for_dinner
we_walked_in to_a smoky restaurant
more_than likely from_the_kitchen in_the_back
it smells like spices in_the air
which_was_a nice change_from_the exhaust smell outside
their_food_is light
flavorful
and despite_the small plates it_comes on
the_portions_are deceivingly huge
their_naan_is beautiful
especially the_garlic_naan
which stole my_heart and my_stomach
after several great dishes
from_their chicken_pakora appetizer crispy
light
and_so darn_good to beef kabob and_chicken_curry
the_experience was_an eye opener and_a life changer for_me
i'm a_fan_of_indian_food now
so_long as i_eat_here and_only here_for_the cuisine
you_must try_it
this_is the_best_indian_food_i've_had in_las_vegas to date
i'm_so glad_i found_this_place so close_to_home
my gf usually doesn't like indian_cuisine but_this_place was_an exception
order_was
chicken_tikka boti
garlic_naan
cheese_naan
chicken_korma
lamb kabob
tandoori_chicken wings
the_chicken_tikka boti was_my gf's favorite out_of all these_dishes
mine was the_chicken_korma at level spiciness
makes my_mouth water just thinking_about that creamy goodness
the_naan_was perfect on both accounts
i_love the_flavor_of those tandoori_chicken wings
the_lamb kabob was_perfectly spiced_to where you_could still appreciate the_flavor_of the_meat
the_service_is_great here and_the_prices_are excellent
i'm so_happy i_was_able_to find another_restaurant that_has high_quality food_with more_than reasonable_prices
if you're looking_for_good pakistani indian halal cuisine look no further
first_time trying_indian_food from_a restarunt i_am a_huge_fan_of curries but_this_place was_lacking
ordered the_chicken_masala if_i remember right_and was_almost gritty because_of seasoning
ordered_the_chicken_tikka and_the saffron sampler and_all_the meat was_cooked_to death really dry
maybe i_dont know what indian_food should be like but the_meat seemed way over cooked
also_got the_cheese_naan that was_great
in_a lonely
half filled strip_mall behind a mcdonald's
the_sign
nearly missed
drew my attention one_day on my_way to_work
an_indian_restaurant
up here
could it be
thoughts of culinary joy filtered into my_mind and_the
curry plum fairies
danced in my_head
this_was_my second_visit to saffron
the_first_time
my_friend_and_i ventured in and_my love sensual decor did_a delighted dance
the_walls are_a warm
almost tuscan texture
and the_windows are hidden by_a dalliance of lovely
transparent
red
gold
and emerald curtains
my_friend_and_i shared the_butter_chicken_and the saffron clay_oven platter
the_butter_chicken held pieces_of tender
moist chicken_in_the most delicious
buttery
flavorful sauce over_rice
the saffron platter was a_mix_of chicken
shrimp
and_indian sausage slow cooked_with tandoori spices in_a clay_oven
we also_ordered the_garlic_naan_bread
which i_thought_was to_die_for
today
i_thought i'd try_the_lunch_buffet since i_had_some time and_wanted more_than my fridge had to_offer
the_buffet_is and contained dishes
salad
and yummy_indian sauces
i_had_the tandoori_chicken wings
a vegetable_samosa
spicy chicken_curry
lamb_curry
a lentil dish as_well as two_other vegetable_dishes
i_am ashamed to_admit that i_am_not fluent in the_names_of indian_dishes
maybe i'll tackle that_in
along_with_the buffet came a_basket_of regular_naan
i'm no expert of_all breads indian
but_this bread_was so_yummy
clearly just baked in_a hot oven
the_bread glistened with butter over it's hot bubbly dough
it_was savory with almost an undetectable hint_of sweetness
all_in all_the_food seemed authentic
not too_spicy
and_you know_i like_my spicy
but in_some cases i_thought needed a smidge more salt
now
i_probably like too_much salt
so_this may_not deserve the elimination of a_star
in_the_end the_atmosphere_is very_nice
and the_staff_is_friendly
attentive_and genuinely concerned that your experience_is a_good_one
if you're ready_to venture away from your weekend trip_to applebee's
and_want something that_will tantalize your taste_buds
head over_to saffron for_some serious yum
great little_place
husband_and_i stopped here_for_the_lunch_buffet on_our way_out of_las_vegas and_i'm so_glad we_did
i'm indian and_thought the_food_was_very_good
flavors_were delicate and_not overdone
they_had interesting dishes on_the_buffet menu
corn spinach_curry
anyone
and it_was_not super heavy like indian_lunch_buffets usually are
they_bring hot
fresh
naan out to_your_table
service_was_attentive and just_right
ambiance is_a_nice blend of_indian_and southwestern without overdoing either
we_loved it so_much_that we_stopped by again to_pick_up chicken_biryani a_few_days later
it_tasted more_like chicken pulav
but was_still very_good
go find_this_place
you won't_be_disappointed
what a_great_find
thank_you yelpers
i_had_a certificate for restaurant
com that_was expiring and we_wanted_to_try something different
after bouncing between their site and here
we_decided_to_give saffron a_try
thank_you to whitney for posting the_location behind_the mcdonalds
otherwise we might_have missed it
we walk up toward their open sign and_get pointed to the_door down tot he right
why in the_world would you put that sign next_to doors you do_not use
anyway
we_were_told we_could sit anywhere we_wanted as_we_were the_only_ones there
the young man was probalbly new because_he could_not answer a question about one_of_the naans
no big_deal
we_started_with_the garlic_naan
bullet naan
tandoori_chicken wings
and the_sampler
both naans_were very_tasty_and the wings were also_very_good
the_sampler was_also eaten pretty fast
even_though_it was_a_bit spicy
probably_a on_a_scale
we_were_not asked_how spicey we_wanted the_sampler
but were asked for_our_entrees
everything was_nice_and tender
everyone also loved the_mango_lassi
not_too_sweet but yummy
of us_ordered the_tikka mix
lamb
chicken
shrimp
but_no fish as mentioned on_the_menu
and_our th ordered the_shrimp saag
the_tikka was_very_good
silly of_us to_get_the sampler as_an_appetizer and_the mix for the_entree
but_it_was good_stuff
very_flavorful_and nicely spiced
the girls raved_about the_saag
prices_were reasonable
portions_were good
but service_was_a_bit_slow
we'll have to_go_back_and_try more_of the_many items_on_the_menu
i_thought_i was in_for_a dining masterpiece after seeing_the solid stars on_yelp
unfortunately
my_experience was_a_bit different_than everyone else
the_service_was_pretty bad_for us
we_got_our orders taken right away
and the_food_was_pretty fast
but_then we didn't_see anyone again_for quite some_time
our mouths were burning from_our food_and we_had_no water
and when_i_went looking for_someone to_fill our_water
i_couldn't even find anyone
that's ridiculous
the_food_itself was_ok
but_not amazing
definitely overpriced
if_i hadn't have gotten a_restaurant
com gc
i_would_have felt super ripped off
as_it_is
i_felt only a_little ripped off
i_guess i'm spoiled
as_i remember getting like dishes_for at_the indian_restaurant_that closed on decatur and charleston
here
i barely got dishes_and an order_of_naan
it_is_the closest indian_place to_me that i_know of
so_i may be_back
but i_won't_be running back
it's_easy_to miss in_its quiet little center
but my_food eyes are vulter ific and_saw that_a indian_place was coming soon to the_neighborhood
we_found they_had_a restaurant
com certificate and_gave it_a_try
when_we_walked_in we_were_greeted with_spices wafting around which_was definitely_a inviting sign
they start you_off with cilrantro and_tamarind chutneys with papadam to nosh while you_wait
bf has discovered tikka so_we decide to_get their_chicken_tikka
so_he can_try more_of it_and see_a range
it_was_pretty nicely spiced and_the_chicken_was tender
i_prefer a_bit richer
almost creamy of_a sauce
but_that's just_a preference that i_tend_to seek so this_isn't my_favorite version
aloo ghobi
cauliflower
potato and_spices sauteed together
the_cauliflower was_cooked nicely soft but_still with_a light bite and_the spices_were flavorful_but not overpowering
they ask how_spicy you_want_it from
we_got_a and it_doesn't really register any spicy at_that point
we_want most things no_spice to mild since the_bf can't eat too_spicy
we_also grabbed some_garlic_naan
which was_pretty_good to_go_with the_meal
dishes comes with_rice_and they_will refill it if you_need more
for_dessert
we got_some gulab_jamun
which_are fried milk dough balls that gets a bath in fragrant syrup and_served warm
the syrup had_a light gingery taste to_it and_the dough was_good
there_were two golf ball sized pieces_and though_they were_tasty
is_not proportional to_what you_got
a ball is_like grabbing a oreo sized cookie at bouchon bakery in_the venetian and_we ain't on_the lv strip
service_was_attentive and_nice
we_got_our drinks_and rice filled and_we_were checked_on
even_though_we were full from our_dishes
for_the_price i_feel it_was_a_bit skimpy on_the portions
i_think_the restaurant
com certificate was_a_good way to_try_this_place
definitely though this_area needs a_place like_this to_bring us_to more_food and culture diversity so_i appreciate when a_new spot opens up that_is something different
i'm curious about their_lunch_buffet
i'm with rob on_this_one probably coming back
but_not running back for_more
despite the_fact_that saffron is_a_little far north for_us_to drive
a_restaurant
com gift_certificate combined with_our love of_indian_food convinced us to_give_it_a_try
we_arrived_at about pm_on_a saturday and_the_place_was deserted
we_were_the_only customers
i worried about_what the_food would_be like if no_one else_was here_and if it_was_good
how_the place_would survive
by_the_end_of our_meal any worries were dispelled
the_food_was_delicious and_the_place_was packed_with hardly an_empty table
the_meal began with_some complimentary pappadums with the_usual accompaniments of mint and_tamarind chutneys
we_started with_a serve of samosas which_i initially thought looked a_bit dense
but_they turned_out_to be the_most aromatic and_delicious samosas i_have_eaten in_las_vegas and_i_found myself regretting not ordering_a double serve
for_our mains we split_a paneer makhani
my_wife_had shahi_paneer and_i_had chicken_tikka_masala
my tikka_masala_was delicious
although it_was_a_bit different to_other tikka masalas i_have_had in_the_past
having a_bit_of_a vindaloo flavour
i initially thought_they might_have mixed up my_order
but_the_chicken was_definitely tikka with clear skewer holes in_the meat
either way
it_was_absolutely divine
my_wife absolutely_loved her shahi_paneer and_when_i helped myself to_some and plenty of_the ample gravy i agreed
very rich_and nutty and_perfect fodder for_the delicious serves of_garlic and_plain_naan we_ordered with our_meal
the_paneer makhani was_also_very_good
although i_found_it just a_touch runny when compared_to the_wonderful consistency of_the shahi dish
if_i_had ordered_it on_its own i would_have_been more_than satisfied
but next_time if_we split_a dish i_think_i'll try some_sort_of kofta_and see how that_is
the_restaurant_itself_is really attractive and_welcoming
when_i read other_reviews that said_it_was in_a
strip_mall
i_had visions of_a grotty row of shops with_some cheesy red and_green neon
but the_place_looks really classy and_the
strip_mall
looks more_like_a business park and is_only brought down slightly by_the presence of_a honking great mcdonald's out front
service_was_great_and friendly
water_was refilled promptly and they_did well handling the sudden influx of crowds
prices_were decent
i_would_say the_main_dishes were a_couple_of bucks more expensive than your average indian_restaurant_and appetizers_were a dollar or_two cheaper than_average
so_if you're ordering a_bit_of everything it_should work out_about even
saffron_flavors_of_india is_a_great addition_to a growing list_of quality_indian establishments in_las_vegas
it's of the_highest quality_and ranks among_the very best
to_the_point where_the thirty to forty minute drive from home won't daunt us in_our future dining decisions
we_will_definitely_be_back
hubby_and_i went last_night on a_recommendation from_a_friend
it_was_pretty quiet when_we_got there only tables of_people
the_decor_is a surprisingly pleasant m lange of tuscan southwest indian
with gold
crimson
and sage being the_main colours
server_was friendly_and_attentive
we_ordered_a chickpea marsala and_a lamb_tikka
both featured tasty
spicy sauces
the naan_was_fresh from_the oven and was_lovely with_the entr_e sauces
everything seemed really_fresh and_nothing left a_bad aftertaste
portion_sizes_are deceptively large
the_prices_are a_little higher than_i_expected
but_i suppose one could split an entr_e or_two to_try to_save some
i_would_come here_again
saffron_flavors_of_india
not to_be confused with plain old saffron on east di
is_the_first indian_chinese fusion restaurant_i've seen
though traditional dishes found on_the menus of most_indian_restaurants make_up the bulk of_the_menu
some interesting plates catch your attention immediately
one_dish that sounded particularly enticing to_us was the_paneer chili
an_appetizer of homemade
mild indian cheese dressed in_a sweet and_sour sauce_with green peppers_and onions
i_know_it sounds strange
but it_was_actually quite successful
the_sauce wasn't sickeningly sweet_and artificial tasting as sweet and_sour often can_be
and we_loved tasting chinese flavors in_a dish_that actually had_some heat
non fusion dishes_were just_as successful
the_sauce of the_lamb_rogan_josh
was_a deep brick red and_flavor packed
letting you_know someone loved_it for awhile
my mushroom and_sweet corn masala
was served_in_a sauce that_was equally complex and_flavorful
yet i_was_disappointed to_see_that canned mushrooms were used
the_sauce_was so incredible
however
i_really didn't mind at_all
anyone who can_make canned mushrooms taste so_good gets a_big culinary thumbs_up from_me
i_also enjoyed_the addition of corn
which replaced the_more common peas found_in many_indian mushroom dishes
fun little extras included_a superb raita with crunchy chunks_of cucumber and_crispy onion pakora
if_you_love onion rings
the_latter is_a_must_try
we_also loved_the bullet naan
a flatbread stuffed_with cheese
potatoes
chickpeas
onion
cilantro
and_green chilies
it made_me think this_restaurant could_do well_as_the first_indian pizza joint
sadly
i fear this_restaurant may_not survive due_to it's location
it's actually fairly easy_to_get to as_it_is right_off_the at craig
but the_new strip center it's_in is dead with_no signs of budding life
i_hate seeing these mom_and pop's dissolve r
i
p taqueria los parados and vegas cafe
i_hope i_can entice you to_go by mentioning that restaurant
com is currently offering certificates valid for_dinner only
today they_have off for st
patty's day with_the code lucky
but_if_you sign up for_their updates they_offer discounts just_as deep nearly every_week
you_can also same money by taking advantage_of their great_lunch_buffet
the_number_of items is_limited
but_it's_a bargain at just
i_had thought that_i_had already reviewed this great_restaurant
but_i_guess i_haven't
i greatly recommend_it
i_would also like_to point_out though
as_i_have sadly come_to realize twice in_the_past couple_of months
that the_restaurant_is closed
not for_good i_might add
it_seems due_to_a family emergency
i'm_sure i
or someone else on_here
will update when_they open back up
i_can't_wait
rolled over there for_the_first_time
and_it_was closed up
with_a note on the_door saying the_chef was_out_of country due_to_a family emergency
however
they will_be_back
major bummer for_me
but_i give them stars_for_the note
the positive_reviews
and_good wishes for the_chef
and_his kin
we_just happened_to call them_for carry_out because we_wanted indian_food and_they_were the_closest one to_us
i_didn't_know it_was there first re opening night and_oh what a_treat
my_husband_had_the lamb_vindaloo_and i_had_the_lamb korma with_both garlic and_plain_naan bread
the_entire meal was_amazing
they_were_busy but the_bartender britney was super_nice_and talked to_me while_i waited
we will_be_going back again
but this_time to_sit and dine
really happy_that they_opened back up so_i_could finally try_them
my mother and_i went_for_dinner on_a_friday_night around p
m
the establishment is divided into two areas
there_is_a bar on_one side_and on_the_other side is the_dining_area
there_were_a_few tables occupied but_not busy yet
two very cheerful servers greeted us_and after being_seated asked_if_we had_any questions
everything on_the_menu_is ala cart so it_can_be pricey
they brought_us a_basket_of papadum and couple_of chutneys
the_green chutney was_my_favorite
while the_red was_a_little_too sour for_my_taste
we started_off with_two mango_lassis and paneer_pakora
my_go_to drink at_any indian_restaurant_is mango_lassi
i_can usually down of_them during_the course_of a_good meal
these did_not_disappoint
nice_and creamy with just_the_right_amount_of sweetness and_perfectly smooth
the paneer_pakora was_huge
not_really that used_to appetizers at_an_indian_restaurant being that big
we_were going_to_get full before the_meal came
the_pakora was crispy_and brown and we_also spread the_chutneys that_came_with the papadum on_them
the_paneer has a_bit_of_a nutty flavor_and is sort of_the consistency of very firm tofu
for_entrees we_ordered butter_chicken
tandoori_chicken_and kadai ghosht
the_butter_chicken_was good
i_got it_at spicy level
was not_to enthused about mom's tandoori_chicken
it_came_out all sizzling and_hot on_the plate but_the piece i_had_was flavorful_but dry
mom said_i must_have picked the_only dry piece on_the plate since her's were_pretty juicy
i_think my_favorite_dish was_the kadai ghosht
it_is_a lamb_curry with_onions garlic_and ginger
it_was_very tender_and succulent and the_flavor was_out_of_this_world
we_also_had panner naan
good
and_garlic_naan
very garlicky so very_good
as_well as they_served us a_small dish of_basmati_rice to_share between us
now as far_as the_service goes
it's_the type_of service i_expected
i_don't_think_i have ever_been_to an_indian_restaurant were the_servers_are snappy
they_are_not bad but_if_you_are expecting to_be in_and_out the you_are out_of luck
they_were_very cheerful and_quite helpful
our_server_was a_bit_too eager_to clear our_plates away
even_when we_hadn't finished yet
i_was_a_bit alarmed to hear a_server recommend_to a_family a vindaloo when_they asked_what was_a_good dish_that_was not_spicy
but considering they go_on a_to spice_level for every_dish i_suppose that was_okay
ordered_the paneer_tikka_masala
shrimp saag
and tandoori_chicken_and they_all tasted so_good
i_highly_recommend saving room_for dessert_and trying their pista kulfi
so rich_and yummy
the_best_indian_food_i've_had yet
hidden_in a_little corner on craig and tenaya
my_boyfriend always told_me about_this_place
but it_had temporarily closed down due_to_the cook having to_go_back to_india
i_saw_the reviews_on here yesterday that it_had reopened and_i called to confirm
we_went last_night
they_are only open for_dinner hours until they_get their clientele back up
soooo
for_dinner we_had_the following
shrimp korma
rogan ghosht
and the_mixed tikka platter
we_had everything on_a spice_level
and it_was_perfect
everything_was_delicious and i_cannot_wait to_go_back again
oh
my jesus this was_excellent
as_soon_as_we walked_in i_could smell the aromas and fell in_love immediately
i_have_never_had indian_food_that was_so_good
the hubby dreads indian but decided_to spoil me
he_was definitely surprised
this_is_the_only indian_restaurant food he_has ever liked
bad first impression
the_waitress_was a_little_off
there_were of_us
she looked around and_told_us that we_had_to wait_for_a_table to_open
hmn
but_there_were open tables
another guy came_by after a_few_minutes
pushed two tables together and seated_us
yay
minutes go by
no menus
no water
no waitress or waiter
a_couple_of more minutes_and the_waitress brings us some pakora_and water
no menus
wth
i really_wanted to_try_this food
otherwise we would've be out after minutes of waiting
so
we flag her down_and request menus
it_was smooth sailing after that
and boy was_it worth_the hassle
if_i_could afford to_go a_few_times a_week i_would
i_was_craving this as_soon_as_i woke up and_again tonight
a_la_carte meals are_on average and_they're not big
not_a_good match for_a food lover on_a budget
my_hubby and_i_were craving_indian_food tonight so we_went_to saffron
we ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
vegetable_korma
veg
samosas_and the_plain nan
we eat_at saffron about once_a_week but_the_food_was especially excellent tonight
i_got food poisoning from this_restaurant
i_would_not recommend_this_place_to anyone
do_not be fooled by_the good_reviews
this_place_is also_pretty pricey
this_is_the_best indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
i_have_been before_and after_the hiatus
and_everything i_have_tried has_been nothing short_of amazing
the vegetable_biryani is_fantastic not_overly greasy
and incredibly fragrant
i_ordered_it
spicy
and_it_was_a religious experience
the dal_makhani is also_delicious
rich_and creamy
but not_overly so
as this_dish can sometimes be
the_naan_is always hot
fresh
and_fluffy
the_environment is inviting
and_the_staff_is very_accommodating
pro tip
take a_date and sit_in the romantic
more private section
so pretty
spend the_extra few dollars a_dish
compared_to the_average indian_restaurant
for_an experience that is_amazing
i_will_definitely_go back_to_this_place
before saffron
i_have_been_to only indian_restaurants which disappointed me enough to_be wary of the_cuisine altogether
i_am_so glad my_husband took_me here_for 'something different'
walked_in
had_a saffron martini drop
an original creation
and_decided
yup
this_is gonna be goood
appetizer
chili_chicken spice
wow
bread basket
garlic_and cheese_naan
my_son scarfed that down
had chicken_tikka_masala_and lamb_masala
yum
staff_were_very nice
restroom was_clean
a_bit_of_a drive from_the_strip
but from_this experience
was well_worth_it
my_son and daughter in law ate_there last_night for_her birthday with_a for coupon we_got in_the mail and_they loved_it and_the_portions_were big enough that_they_were full_and had left_over to_take_home
don
t ask me what_they ordered but_they said_it_was spicy_but_not to spicy like_they experienced in other_indian_restaurants
the_food_is_great but_the hours are terrible
i finally_got a_chance_to go_here after work
my rd attempt
i_tried_a couple more_times for_lunch but they_weren't open
i_wasn't in_the_mood for_curry
so_i_had me_some chicken_tikka
i_was thinkin some veggies so_i got kachumber salad too
the_server suggested garlic_naan also
so_when all the_food_came_out
i_get embarrassed
the_portions_were huge that the_cook came_out_to move another table next_to mine
i_did the_best_i could but man vs food
i_am_not
i_had enough leftover for the_next_day
my advise
bring a_friend you wanna impress
i'd come_back
when they're open
save yourself a_trip
management was_very rude to_us after_my year old son got severly ill from_their chicken_dish
apparently the_waitress could_not tell us what_was in_the_sauce and_we_had to_run out_of_the restaurant and_was severely ill all weekend from the_food they_served
i_will_not go_back_to this_restaurant_and do_not recommend
round for saffron_flavors_of_india
why has it taken so_long if_it's so_good
you_ask
because_i'm on_a damn budget
we
of_us
were_seated_immediately with menus this_time
that sure made ordering food a_lot quicker
i_think_it helped that our_waitress_was not the_same and knew how_to waitress
had_the bullet nan
saffron platter
and goan fish
absolutely_loved the goan fish_and bullet nan
saffron platter was_ok
i would've tried some_other items but_on those
small_portions
and_a coke
i'll save up_for next_time
damn
y u gotta be_so 'spencers
after_a_long hard day_of fieldwork
i_stopped in_to saffron on my_way back_to_the hotel to_pick_up a_to_go order
the_chef graciously took my_order even though they_were_closed at_the_time
pm
back_at the_hotel
i eagerly dove into_my kadai chicken boneless chicken_in a_sauce of i_don't quite know what but it_was_delicious
slivers of ginger and surprise pops of coriander seed
yum
i inhaled it with_my aloo naan
and_was in heaven
now i_am_in a food_coma
but i_will_definitely come_back_here for_a proper dinner the_next_time_i am in_las_vegas
my hubby_and_i just did take_out from saffron
we_have_a ritual where_we share an indian_beer and_an ap at_the_restaurant and_take the_rest home
tonight the_food_was particularly on
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was perfect
the_veg korma_was right_on
and the_veg samosas_were pretty great_as_well
this_is_the_best indian_restaurant_in_vegas and_i_could eat_it every_week
yay
i'm_a_fan
so_i_was going home_from this_side_of_town
and_i desired a_bit_of good eats to_arrive home_with
here's a shout out_to yelp for leading me to_this_place
i_never would_have stumbled across this tucked_away place otherwise
even if_i happened upon this establishment
i'm not_even sure i_would_have guessed it to_offer take_out
there's enough class inside that i_actually asked if they_even did
and soon found_out i_would_be one_of three doing the_same
there_is_a separate dining_area from_the bar
but from_the passersby
i_guess_it to_have accommodated them nicely
the_bar area seems_to have_a_full compliment
and_the tender definitely seemed_to know his way around it
not_that i_sampled
i sat at one_of_the_few bar tables_and watched the television they_had up
i_was_very kindly offered water or soda while_i waited_for my_order
a first for_me when getting take_out
after perusing the_entire dinner_menu
i settled on the_chicken_tikka_masala caught my eye as_it brings together the joys of the_tandoor
grill oven
with curry
luckily the_dish comes with_rice
as_you really_don't get_a_lot for_the money here
what you_do get is quality over quantity
but i'm_a_fan of_both
i_was asked on_a_scale of to how_spicy i_wanted it
after discussion that_i'm a_fan_of a_little heat
we concluded that i_should try an
well
the tickled some
and_it_was flavorful not_just spicy for_its own sake
it certainly carried the graceful interplay of_spices_and textures of good_indian_food
it had_an acceptable amount of_chicken that was_cooked_to_perfection
delish it_was most definitely
first timer
and_now we_will_be_back as often as we_can
i never_had_indian_food ever and_the_server was_very_nice_and helped me figure out_what may like
she did great
the_heat index was_perfect and_i_love the_flavors with_the all_the_dishes we_had
the_bar was_nice
the_tables nicely laid out and_the_staff_was very_pleasant
i_love these flavors
cheap it_is_not but quality it_is
top_notch
spring rolls were fried but super tasty
the begay korea with tofu was sublime
rice basmati was fluffy_and light
extra order is dollars but needed if_you_want enough rice to_have rice_with your second helping that you_will_not be_able_to resist
the_garlic nann is perfectly done
next_time_i_will add cheese to_the naan_for extra goodness
also_had_the beef shank indian_style
it_was insane
i bet every_dish here_is good
try the_tikka chip everyone_was ordering it
enjoy star at to star prices we_had drinks and_it_was but would_have_been without alcohol
they_do take_out too
loved_it all bravo
raj and ritesh
thank_you for_a_great indian_restaurant_in_the northwest
if_you_love real authentic_indian_food you_have_to give saffron a_try
my_wife_and_i love_it
by_far_the_best_indian restaurant_in_vegas
they went away for awhile and_i swear i_was_in withdrawals
me and_the girlfriend love_this_place and_the_owner is_just great
we_came out one_day and they_weren't open but the_chef was cooking and_he cooked for_us as_well
not_only great_food but great owner and_a_great chef as_well
our favorites
garlic_naan we always_get like orders_of this its so_good
chicken_tikki_masala
lamb vindoolo
butter_chicken
all of_these and_everything else they_have you_will love
definitely worthwhile
the_only_thing is_that_they need to_get_the takeout menu back up so_i_can get_it for_lunch regularly
wow
for_all_the great_reviews
no_one seems_to mention that_the_food amount to price ratio is off_the charts
you're_going_to spend a_lot for a_little
having said_that
the food_is_tasty
our_waitress seemed_like_a new summer
high school hire so_we didn't_feel too_much love from her and_it_took a_bit to_get her attention even_though_we were the_first group in the_dining_room and eventually only_one of_two groups there
who made the_same quizzical look_at_the food when_it arrived
based on_its small size
again
i_don't mind spending a_bunch for great_food
but a_small bowl for_over seems steep even in_vegas
and_this_is no where near the_strip
and_that bowl was advertised to_serve two
ha
nice_ambience
the_best_indian_food_i_have eaten in_las_vegas
very_good_indian_food with a_wide_selection including more traditional dishes i_wasn't familiar_with
it_is_a small_restaurant but always seems busy without being packed
service_was_attentive
a_little_pricey
e
g
chicken_curry dishes_were
but_overall very_good
decided_to visit_this_place during a weekend getaway to_vegas after seeing reviews_on_yelp and trip advisor
food
tastes great
we_had chicken_tikka_masala
butter_chicken
chili shrimp
spiced to_taste
smaller portions
one entry feeds adult
garlic_naan_was excellent
kids swore it_was_the_best they've ever_had
the_fact_that they_had indo_chinese choices was_a_huge plus as_well
only con was the_dessert
they lost a_star for_this
gulab_jamun was_not_good at_all
and they_still charged us for_it even_though_i said it_wasn't edible
they_serve it cold
and_the insides were rock hard
overall
this_was the_best_indian_food_i've_had in_a_very long time
decor
elegant
nothing too fancy
but tasteful
in_a quiet
residential area
service
very_friendly
at_times a_tad slow
not_too sure who our_server_was
at_times it_was_a guy
at_times it_was_the hostess who_was quite_nice
cost
a_little_pricey
entree
bill for adults and kids was without drinks
this_indian_restaurant is a_gem and is_definitely_worth visiting
especially_if_you live_in_the nw part_of_the valley
i_took my_family_and my sister's family from california and_all seven of_us absolutely_loved the dining_experience
we_started off_with vegetable_samosas
which_were full_of potatoes
peas
and_maybe some carrots
while_the pastry could_have_been_a tad thinner and lighter
it_was_delicious nevertheless
for
we_got two large samosas
for_our_main course
we_ordered chicken_tikka_masala
chana
chick_peas
masala
tandoori_chicken
garlic_naan
chili fish
and_garlic shrimp
the_last two items_were part_of_the indo_chinese section of_the_menu
every one_of_the_dishes was_well prepared
nicely presented
and very_flavorful
the_restaurant_was clean_and spacious with ample parking
i_have_been_to or different indian_restaurants_in_las_vegas and this_one is_one_of_the_best
i_wish_i_had a_better experience_at his place
because_i normally like_indian_food
maybe also we_ordered_the wrong item
but_it just wasn't or stars for_me
we_went_there on_a_thursday i_think in_the afternoon and we_were_the_only people in_the_restaurant
nothing_to complain about the_service
we_ended_up ordering_the combination platter to_share
the_selection_of meats on_the platter was_very_good
but i_felt_like something was_missing
the platter didn't_come with_any sides or sauces
we_ordered_the garlic_nan on_the side
but everything_was_very dry_and hard_to swallow
i_wish_the dish came with_rice_and_a sauce or_something like_that
especially for_the_price they_were charging
prices_are_pretty high in_my_opinion but_i_think i_will_go_back if_i get a_chance and_try and_order one_of_their saucy dishes
this first_experience left_me very unsatisfied but_i'm willing to_give the_restaurant another_chance
wowzers
i_am_so so_glad that_i strolled into this_place_and check ed it_out
i_was_craving indian_food_so incredibly badly since_i left dc and_with no_one out_here expect for_my coworker
who i_can't lunch_with during work
with_a palate for_indian_cuisine
i_decided upon the_first_place i_saw on_yelp
i_saw_the yelp_reviews and_decided lets go
thanks everyone
i_was seated within seconds of arriving and received my beverage within a_second of sitting down
the_waitress then asked_me if_i wanted garlic or regular_naan
and_being me
of_course i_ordered_the garlic
she guided me over to_the_buffet
and basically told_me to dig in
my_eyes grew wide i started_with a_salad with_the delicious cucumber dressing and little jalape o
tay tay tasty
then_i went and_got my_main meal
i loaded up_with_some rice and_then piled the curry_chicken pepper splashed some_of that ritata sauce_on there_and headed back to_the_table
after piling a mountain of_food onto that yummy delicious warm garlic_naan i shoveled that food down so quick_and went for_seconds
and_then thirds
ahhhhh somebody stop me
in_my many trips to_the_buffet bar i_also_tried the_garlic chicken
which_was_good
almost a_little dry
but_it made_the cut for_me_and then something else
to_be_honest i didn't_even look_at_the name
i_just dove in and_took it
it_might have_been the_chicken_masala come_to think_of it
overall the_experience was_a_great one
for the_meal_and i_will_definitely_be going back
possibly as_soon as next week
stop everything you_are doing this very instant and_get going already
great_flavors
but beware if you're looking_for spicy
you're gonna have_to beg
we_ordered dishes at_an level
one was_a vindaloo
and_both_were very_bland
the_other problem is service
nice
but incredibly stupid waitresses
our bottle_of_wine was dropped off_with our glasses but_never poured
we poured every single time
also
the_server never checked to_see_how our_food_was until we_were totally done flagged her down_for a check
she_was surprised_that we_weren't happy_with_the spiciness hello
why didn't you_ask
also
even_after she_brought the cc receipt
she still didn't clear our_plates
yuck
but we'll come_back_for takeout
just will ask_for_a or indian hot
ok
so me and_the mrs
had_a hankering for some_good indian_food_and saffron delivered big time
we_had a_few_different naan's
aloo_gobi and_a rajma
all were_fantastic
the_staff_was_friendly
we_did take_out so i_am_not_sure how the_service_is for dine_in
however the_dining_room was_fairly full so_i would venture to_say the_service_is_good
anyone on this_side_of_town would do well to_give saffron a_shot
we_were missing our_favorite place_in sd
did a_yelp search and_came up_with saffron
it_was_really close so_we_decided to_give_it_a_try
it's_in_a quiet strip_mall so parking_is plentiful
although at_first we_saw it_as_a red flag
we quickly decided_that wasn't the_case
the_ambiance_is a_little_off
you_walk into_a really brightly lit bar area
with_no recognizable hostess station
although we_were_greeted quickly_and with_a_big smile from the_bartender and_were passed off to_a hostess who seated_us immediately
here's where i_do_not really know_how_to express myself well
everyone_was happy and_helpful
the_place_is bright_and cheery
but something is_off
i_think_the tables are as welcoming_and maybe_the place_has too_much lighting
sort of reminded me of_a cafeteria that had_been dressed up_with_some bright colors and lot's of curtains
the important part the_food
was_awesome
we_ordered_chicken samosas_and chicken pankora's to_start_with
both were_excellent
we especially enjoyed the_samosas
the_chicken meat_was ground and mixed_with wonderful spices
very very_tasty
for_dinner we_ordered lamb_vindaloo_and chicken_masala tandoori
again both plates were_fantastic especially_with the_garlic_naan we_ordered
we_really_enjoyed our_dinner and_the_staff was_very_attentive
we_never wanted for_anything
i_would_like_to see the_ambiance set_up better for_dinner
something less bright_and maybe a_little_more intimate
this_review_is_for_the lunch_buffet
why stars
not_only_is it an_excellent value_for the_money
but everything_is fresh_and_delicious
i_am_not an_indian_food guy
so i_don't_know how authentic it_is or how_it compares to others
but_i_will tell you
it_will_be hard finding a_better way to_spend the_same money for_lunch
the_garlic_naan_bread was_amazing
we_ordered two baskets for the_table and_it_was devoured quickly
some_of_the best
bread
that i_have_had
so_so good
i_liked most_of_the_dishes i tired
but a_few_of the_meat_dishes stood out
and were_great to_eat with_the accompanying dipping_sauces
a_few_times the_serving food went empty since_it_was very_busy
but_that meant fresh_food was coming out within minutes
only bad_thing
they_were really busy
and_it didn't_look like_their was_much help on_the_floor
the poor guy_was literally running around in circles and_was forgetting refills and pulling plates
but_that_was hardly enough for_me_to drop the_review down_a notch since it_didn't ruin or affect our_lunch here too_much
i_will_be_back again
i_say go_for_it
especially if_you_live on this_side_of_town
saffron's lunch_buffet_is just_ok
high points
very_good value
awesome garlic_naan
low points
very_small selection
and_when we_were_there we_were_the_only customers_and so the_food_was never refreshed
the_service_was_good
but i_would_expect that considering we_were alone in_the_restaurant
i would've liked to_see a_few_more selections
there_was saag_paneer
a chicken_dish
fish_curry and_i_believe a_veggie curry
accompanied by some onion pakora_and fried_chicken strips
nothing_was bad but_nothing blew my_mind
either
i_still have_yet to_find_a vegas_indian buffet_that i_like better_than mint
i_never had_indian_food_before visiting saffron
after meeting the_owner
raj
on my_first_visit
he was_very_helpful in menu selections and_really cared about_our liking what he_suggested for_dinner
we_have_been back several_times since and have_always had_great food_and_great_service
i_would_recommend_this restaurant to_everyone
thank_you raj for_a great_experience_and even greater food
great_food
warning
the_spice_level is i_had_a thinking it_would_be med
i_was wrong it_was_pretty spicy
can't imagine a
some have_said it's pricey
but_i_didn't think_it_was any more expansive then going_to chilies or outback
if_you_want good_food your going to_pay_for it
on_a whim
since_we_were in_the_area
we_thought we_would give_this_place_a try
oh man
i_am glad_that we_did
it_was d licious
the hubby ordered_the_chicken j
don't_remember how_to spell the_rest_of it
and_i_ordered something that_wasn't even on_the_menu
but_they_were more_than happy to_make_it for_me
they_had_a shrimp korma
but_i wanted chicken instead
we_both_had our_meals a_spicy out_of
it_was goooooood
it_was_spicy enough_for me and_i_love things spicy
also
if you check into yelp while dining
you_get_a discount
check_it_out
tried saffron_flavors_of_india for takeaway dinner_on_a whim and_came away very_impressed
the_food_was_excellent
small thing
for_me
when_i_arrived on time_for pickup the_food_wasn't ready
another takeaway customer arrived and_had_the same problem
they've got_some timing issues
but i_was_able_to easily overlook that by the_quality_of_the_food
which_is for_sure the_best available in_las_vegas
and_i've tried just_about all of_them
while_i waited_for my_food i_noticed the_restaurant looked great
a_large
fully stocked bar_and a_comfortable
modern dining_room
for_me
saffron is_a_little out_of_the way
but_i'm happy_to overlook that too for_their excellent_food
glad to_have found_it
wow
what_a_great restaurant
let's start_with the_tandoori_chicken
often a dry
if tartly tasty
disappointment
an afterthought in_the vegetarian marvelousness that_is indian_food in_general
here
though
it_was richly flavorful
moist_and yielding seriously
the_best_i_have_ever had
the_people raving about the_garlic_naan_bread are absolutely right fresh baked
with_just_the right level_of browned bottom
the_service_was_very pleasant maybe a_bit over attentive
because we_arrived_at a slow time
that's a_shame
because quite honestly
this_restaurant should never have_any slow times
the_decor_is lovely draped curtains
mellow
classy atmosphere
it's_not_a hole in_the_wall by_any_means
overall
an outstanding restaurant
and i_hope it catches on soon
saffron_flavors_of_india gets stars_for customer_service and amazing_food
on_a whim
i stopped_in to_see about take_out
they_didn't_have any menus but offered_to email one to_me
the_restaurant_is on_the_way home
so_i_can call in_the order and_it_is ready by_the_time i_get there
the_food_is_always delicious_and i_have_a weekly craving for_the_naan
i really_need to_try_out the_lunch_buffet sometime
stopped in_for_the_lunch_buffet
should_have arrived earlier than
pm
as_many of_the_dishes needed refilling and_were somewhat slow to_refill
i chalk this up_to a possible combination_of the_fact_that it_was_almost hours into their hour buffet window
and_that the_dining_area was maybe half_full
the_buffet itself featured a_small but nice_selection
i_tried_the following
rice
chick_peas in_a cheese curry_sauce
mattar_paneer
lamb_masala
fish_curry
orange chicken
onion pakora
onion strips fried in_a chick_pea batter
garlic_naan
there_was another chicken_dish
but_it_was never refilled so i_did_not get_to_try it
their best dishes_were the_garlic_naan
which_was pretty great
and the_fish_curry
which_was tasty_but could_have had more_of_a kick_to the_curry
the_rest were somewhat above_average
the_service_was_good and_the_atmosphere was_nice understated decor with_some soft indian background music
i_give it_stars overall because_i enjoyed_the_food
despite_the small selection_and slow refilling
the nature of a_buffet greatly limits the degree of the_spice heat in_the_food
so_i_can't judge them_on the_spice_level
or lack thereof
it_was_a pleasant lunch
but i'll_have to_try_some regular dishes before_i can render a_more definitive verdict
went on_a_tuesday night and_the_place_was almost empty
too_bad for_the missing customers as this_place_is_great
ordered two apps
then_the mixed_grill
the_chicken_biryani and_the shrimp_vindaloo along_with bullet and_garlic_naan
the portion_size on_the biryani_is immense
tasty as_well
my_wife enjoyed_the mixed_grill
especially the_tandoori_chicken
i_ordered_the shrimp_vindaloo with a_spice index and_it certainy packed a punch
i_really wish they_offered chicken_vindaloo as_well
maybe in_the_future
the bullet naan_is something special and_the_garlic_naan did_not_disappoint
service_was_very_good to begin with
but got a_little_slow near the_end_of_the_meal
we_had_to_wait a_bit for to_go boxes for the_leftovers
overall
very_good_food and_good_service
we_will_be_back
the skinny
came_in_for their_lunch_buffet and_was greatly disappointed_with_the lack_of selection and_the_quality_of some_of_the items
for f
k's sake they f ked up kheer
service_was_good nothing_special though
value
given_the plethora of_indian_restaurants offering buffets in_the_valley
this_one ranks poorly with regards to price
selection and_quality
came_in because we'd heard they_were starting to_do lunch_buffets
add the recent promotion of off
we_were psyched to_try_it_out especially_when it's a_lot closer_to our neck of_the woods
i_was_really surprised_by_the lack_of selection available considering the_price
for
there_were hot items
including rice
with a_small salad fruit bar_and kheer
but this_would_be okay if the_food_was_fantastic across_the board
however it missed the mark
of_all of_the_dishes
the standout was_the goan fish_curry
the_fish had a_lovely texture while the_curry_was wonderfully mellow
however
you were_pretty much dumpster diving to look_for pieces_of fish in the_curry
other_than_that
everything_else_was okay
lamb_masala
chana_masala
paneer_masala
to_not so_great
of_the not so_great items was the_dal
bland
the orange chicken
soggy
overly sweet i'm_not sure_how this fits in_with everything else this s
t is about_as american as apple pie
and the_kheer
i_have_to take a_minute about_how they messed up the_kheer
not_only did they cheap out_on_the rice
they_used some_sort_of long grain instead_of basmati
they may_have used leftover rice to_make_it with_the rather large clumps of_rice emerging from_the pudding
if you stirred the_rice while you_were cooking it
this doesn't happen
in_addition
the_rice_was undercooked and_hard
plus you don't_even get_that hit nice hit of cardamom at_all
bleh
major turn off
the_garlic_naan came to_the_table nice_and hot_and flavourful
however texturally
it_was_a_little too hard
a_little_too doughy and not_enough flakiness
sporting a_tomato chutney
an unpleasantly weak mint_chutney
where's the mango_chutney
and a_rather watery raita
i_was_disappointed by the_lack_of pickles and_other condiments normally seen at_other_places
given_the plehtora of_places available in_the_valley that offer better selection
better quality_and overall better prices
i'd skip this_place for_the_lunch_buffet
starred review
stopped by for_lunch with_a_few coworkers to_get additional opinions and_to order_something off_the_menu with_some kick_to the_spice_level
the_other three
one_of whom had_never eaten_indian_food
none_of whom had_been here_before
ordered the_lunch_buffet
and_i_ordered_the chicken_madras
chicken_cooked in madras curry
at level heat
i_was_very pleased with_the chicken_madras
a_nice blend_of flavors savory
spicy
a_bit_of sweetness combined with_a pleasingly spicy kick that complemented the_flavors rather than overwhelming them
the_naan
we had_one basket_of regular
one basket_of garlic
was_excellent as_well
served warm
crispy
and_chewy
everyone enjoyed_their food
and_the_other fan of_spicy foods also_liked the bit_of chicken_madras she tried
finding it_spicy flavorful_but not overpowering
service_was_prompt and_courteous
and_the overall experience went_well
given my_second experience_here
i'm bumping my score up_to a
i_don't get over to_the w side too often
but decided_to_go out_of_my way to_try_this_place after spending a morning working red rock casino recently
no_complaints about value lunch_buffet_in this town's pretty much the_standard
pretty_decent of_items offered too
specifically
chicken_tikka korma
saag_paneer
aloo ghobi
garlic_naan_were all_good
i'll be_back
i've visited_this establishment twice
once for_dinner_and more recently for_their reopened lunch_buffet
for_dinner
the food_was_okay
but_the_service_was severely lacking
it_took forever
about hours total
to_order our_food
get water_and refills
get our_food and_finally pay our_check
the_butter_chicken_was so_so
the_aloo_gobi even less remarkable
the kinds_of naan_were too doughy
despite this mediocre experience
i_was willing to_give their_lunch_buffet a_try
especially since_the wifey was curious to_experience their cuisine
what_a mistake that_was
first of_all
the_price_of
is_at the_high end for indian_lunch_buffets
and_this_place_is the_exception to_the rule that_you_get what_you_pay for
the_selection and_quality was downright pathetic and frankly embarassing
ok
to_be fair
it_was_still better_than our abysmal experience_at sherpa house
in golden
co
but_that_is setting the_bar extremely low
there_were_a whopping total of_hot trays consisting of_items such_as onion
pakora
basically onion ring fragments
orange chicken
daal
chana_masala
goan fish_curry
lamb_curry
paneer_masala
and
non basmati
rice
there_was_also_a small salad_bar section and kheer
there_was_a surprising lack_of classic staples such_as mango_chutney
samosas
tandoori_chicken
any_kind_of chicken_curry
or saag
although we_enjoyed the_fish_curry
it_could not_make up_for_the lack_of selection and_quality_of the_rest_of items
the_garlic_naan_was so_so
it_was simultaneously too doughy yet too hard and_dry on the_bottom
the_kheer was the_worst we've ever_had
it lacked cardamom flavor_and contained numerous clumps of_rice
at least this time_around
the_service_was half decent
the_only_other mitigating factor was they_were running a_off promotion
although we_had_to specifically ask_for the discount to_be applied
that being_said
the_fact_that this_place garners stellar reviews is a_real head scratcher
perhaps
restaurants located_in_the
relative
boonies are held to_a lower standard
who knows
as for_me
when_i rate a_restaurant
i_don't_care where a restaurant_is_located
the_food_is either good_or it_isn't
it's either a good_value or it_isn't
unfortunately
this_place_is neither
curry in_a_hurry
delish
so wonderful_and tasty_and spicy
i_love_it here
saffron is an_awesome restaurant
they feature a particularly rare branch of_indian_food indian_chinese
it_is impossible to_find indian chinese_food
let alone good_indian chinese_food
i_had_the chili paneer
it_was life changing
it_was_fantastic
i_just_wish this_place_was so out_of_the way
otherwise i'd_be way_more often
so_good
they_have other indian_options too
but trust_me
try the_indian chinese_food
i_went yesterday
saturday
to their_buffet
it_is not_a_big buffet_but it_was_very_good and_had a_variety_of choices
the_tandoori_chicken wings were out_of_this_world great
and
the curry_dishes were_very_good
i_even tried one called goon fish_curry and_it_was probably_the_best of_all
very_good curry_dish and the_fish was_very_tasty
you_can get regular or garlic_naan_bread with_your buffet
i_got_the garlic_and it_was_really_good
hot_and_fresh
the_place is_very_nice_and clean
i_went once on_a_weekday and_once on saturday
the_buffet_is on wednesday through saturday and_the weekday wasn't very_busy but_there_was a_nice crowd on saturday
i_will_definitely_be_back
tandoori_chicken_and shrimp_vindaloo is_what_i got_there and dollars
tandoori had_about med pieces chicken level spicy_and it_was_spicy
the shrimp_vindaloo was_a_good big portion recommend if in_the_mood for shrimp and balsamic rice
if_you_want indian_food it is_really_good but pricey
great_food_and awesome service
definitely_will go_here again
love saffron
raj and_the team
the_food_is_amazing
the freshness and_quality is_very_good
highly_recommend
we_had_the lunch_buffet_and was_very_impressed
they_had_a fish_curry dish one_of_the only indian_food buffet places i've_found with_this
lots_of flavor heavier on cumin and_spices than an average place
which we_love
also very_clean_and excellent_service
our quest to_find_the best_indian_lunch_buffet in_vegas continues
protip
this_isn't it
my_wife_and_i had_been here_for_dinner before_and it_was_actually quite_tasty
so_we trucked all_the_way up_to craig on_a_weekday afternoon to_try_the_buffet
and sadly
it_didn't live up_to our expectations based on dinner service
the_naan_was still amazing
but the_buffet selection_was downright paltry
my firang side was pleased with the_usual chicken_tikka_and pakora but_i come_to a_lunch_buffet to_try a_variety_of different_things
if saffron would devote more space and effort_to the_lunch_buffet instead_of cramming a_small selection into a_tiny alcove
it_would_be worth_a return_visit
the_food_quality is_actually very good_but_the limited selection just kills it for_me
oh saffron what have you done
ok firstly i_have_been going_to saffron since they_opened at_their new_location on craig
i_like there lunch_buffet but sadly i'm_giving a_bad review not because_of_the food_but because_of_the lack_of food during my_last_visit
i_went_in on feb th at pm i_was seated quickly like_i always am
we_went_to get_some food_and noticed almost_everything was_out
i assumed they_would still be cooking since_they closed at
and they_usually just cook small_portions and refill the_food
however after minutes i noticed_that they_weren't bringing anything out
i_asked_the server first about my_water since_i never_got one then about_the_food
he said we're closing so no_more food_is cooking
i_asked why no_one would tell_me this when_i sat down and_the_server repeated that_they close at
he said he_would ask_if anything else could_be cooked_and came_back again stating they close at
i_can't_believe that after coming so often to_eat that_they wouldn't_have the courtesy of letting me know_that i_would_be paying full price_for pieces_of cut up chicken_and some_rice
maybe they_should institute a last call or_something of_that nature
i_actually loved coming_here_for lunch but ever_since this happened i_have_been driving past saffron to_go_to mt
everest
mint or namaste depending on_my mood
p
s please bring back the_tandoori_chicken to_the_lunch_buffet
i_am pretty_sure this_is_the_only lunch_buffet_in vegas_that doesn't_have tandoori_chicken available
i_am_going_to give saffron_flavors_of_india a rare five_stars from_me tonight because quite honestly
i_have nothing negative to_say
a_few_weeks_ago told a_different story
i_had a_craving_for curry on_a monday night but saffron is closed on monday
i_did_not know_this until after i_tried three doors before seeing their hours posted on_the first door revisited
i_was frustrated
today
though
is wednesday and saffron is open
i parked at_about
in_an open and empty lot
as_i approached
a man opened the_door and warmly welcomed me_in
good impression number one
i_was seated_immediately as the_restaurant_was mostly empty much to_my_surprise
when_i_was seated i_noticed the strong aroma of_the many exotic spices i_would_be enjoying shortly
i_also noticed_the indian_music lending itself to_a comforting and_authentic dining_experience
good impression number two
within less_than_a minute of being_seated i_was brought_a glass_of_water
a_food menu
a wine menu
a_basket_of crispy flat_bread stuff
apologies for_not knowing the true name
and_two sauces
a_mint sauce and_a tamarind_sauce
the_latter of_the_two sauces was_my_favorite
i_took a_few_minutes to familiarize myself with the_menu
i settled upon palak chicken and_a_side_of garlic_naan
the_naan came out_quickly and was_absolutely_delicious
it_was hot
crisp
and_chewy with_plenty_of minced garlic on top
a_few_minutes later my palak chicken came out_in a_hot bowl and accompanied with long grain rice in_a separate bowl
the_palak was_a brilliant green from the_spinach
it_was topped with cream_and a sprig of cilantro
a_beautiful presentation to be_sure
i_had trouble finding the_chicken until_i spooned it_on to my_plate
it_was there hiding out amongst the_spinach base
it_was_not the_most tender_chicken i_have_had at_an_indian_restaurant but chicken does not need_to_be fork tender to_be_good
it_still fell apart in_my_mouth
good impression number three
i_ate all_of my rice but took_my palak chicken and_garlic_naan home to_have for_lunch_the_next_day
my check came as_i_was bagging up_my leftovers
it_had_a smiley face drawn on_it
talk_about service with a_smile
good impression number four
this_was very_much a_comfortable and_relaxing dining_experience
from_the soft spoken and_friendly waiter to_the delicious_food cooked to_my spice request of
out_of
my night at saffron was_just what_the doctor ordered
i_will_be_back but probably_not all too soon
it_is a_little_high priced as indian_cuisine tends_to be
but_when the hunger strikes
an occasional splurge is_in well within reason
i_would_go_back for_the chicken_tikki_masala the_garlic_naan
just remember
the_portions_are small
so
don't_expect to_be getting a_huge entree of_chicken
for_the_price
i_think_they could've given more chicken
the_small curry_bowl was_filled chicken_and sauce
naan
it was_absolutely_delicious dipping the_naan into_the masala_sauce
what made_it most enjoyable was_the surprise crispy texture on_its bottom
almost like_an_indian pizza
mom had the_aloo ghobi seemed_to be disappointed_with_the dryness
she kept on saying how_it was_missing something something
since this_dish isn't familiar to_me
i had_no_idea how to_compare
we_also_had_the vegetable_samosa
surprisingly
it_was_not fried
but baked
mom was_quite upset about_it and said_it would've tasted better fried
i_agree_with her
but_i_did think_it helped cut back on_the calories
perhaps
if they_used filo dough
the thick pastry would've been a_better choice
for_me
it_was_a star visit
for mom
probably a_star visit
i'd_like_to return_for their_buffet just to_see_how they_cook the other_items
what a_total disappointment
i_was naive and_did_not listen to some_of_the reviews_here
the_biggest complaint_i have_is price_and quantity quality_of_food
i_ordered chicken_tikka_masala_and lamb with spinach_curry or_something like_that
first
the_flavor_was nothing_special
i_actually thought_it_was bland_and something i_could_have made myself
second
the_prices_are ridiculous
look i_don't mind paying a_lot_of money if it's_worth_it
i've_been_to gordon ramsay on paris and del friscos double eagle steakhouse
both expensive but totally_worth it
the_prices
chicken_tikka_masala_was
serve in_a
i kid you not
dog's bowl size container
inches in diameter and inches deep
little cubes_of chicken and_the_rest was sauce
the_lamb
same_as the_chicken_tikka
little pieces and_the_rest was sauce
i_felt totally cheated
i give_this business a_few_more months_and it's going_to close down
people please listen up_and spend it where_you can_get more bang and_flavor for hour buck
trust_me on_this_one
go_to mt_everest on_sahara or_something similar but_not this_one please
so i_have_eaten_at over indian_food restaurants around_the_world and_this_is in_my top
food_is_always consistently good
service_is exceptional
the_owner_and wait_staff knew my preferences and_what i_wanted by_my third visit
i_have_tried over ten items_on_the_menu and_every one_of_the_dishes sampled was_great
while_i don't usually eat the_garlic_naan with_my meals theirs is_the_best_i've tasted
i_highly_recommend you try_this_place
update to mr rajesh p who responded to my_review
yes
i_am talking about the_same saffron restaurant_on w craig rd
i spent years in the_uk and_have dine_in over indian_restaurants
i'm pretty_sure i_know_what i_am talking about
indian_restaurants_in europe are more_authentic i_may say
so_much so_that at_one point the_uk made chicken_tikka_masala uk's national food
or
it_was_still a_small amount_of_food for_the money
just try going_to one_of_the known indian_restaurants_around here_and you_know_what i_am talking about
bottom_line
food_quality quantity is_not worth_the_price and_i_believe people need_to know_this before going
since leaving england years_ago
my_wife and_i_have_been in_search for_a proper indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas and we_finally found_it
saffron_flavors has a_great_selection_of tasty indian_food_and selection_of alcohol beverages
and kingfisher beer
the_staff_is_very kind_and are willing to_make different_dishes to_your liking
i_prefer the_chicken phall and chicken_vindaloo because_of_the spicy taste which raj is more_than happy to_make_it as_spicy or not_spicy just the_way you_want_it
you_can find my_wife_and_i driving from nellis afb to_visit every saturday for_their_lunch_buffet at_a_very good_price
whoever says you_get very_little food for_the_price here_at saffron_flavors is_definitely used to_the_other less reputable indian_food
joints
that las_vegas has_to_offer
cheers
very_good
got_there at_the_end_of lunch and_the_waiter had the_chef prepare fresh main course rather than have us eat the_buffet
suggestion for_lunch arrive before
great_place_for dinner
best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
nice_atmosphere
pleasant service
this_is much better_than many_of_the more expensive places near the_strip
the_food_was_great but_i_felt the_amount_of money spent for food_was high_for what_was received
even the_lunch_buffet_is good
you can't_go_wrong here
the_buffet_is amazing everything i_mean everything_is delicious naan_bread comes included with_the low price
very_nice clean restaurant
best aloo_gobi in_town
the yummiest indian_food_i_have_ever tried_in the town
specially try_their indo_chinese dishes
great_food
nice restaurant_and awesome hospitality
not_like other typical indian_restaurant_in_the town
yup so_i finally bit the bullet and_went back_to saffron
i drive_by it_so often i_had_to give_them_a chance
and this_time they did_not_disappoint
i_have to_be_honest and_say i've been_back a_couple_times but_just to_make_sure that_it_is consistently good in_order for_me_to finally upgrade my_review
looks like_they listened and_now have tandoori_chicken all_the_time for_the_lunch_buffet
the_food_has been_great and_you no_longer have to_worry about_what time you're planning on going in
they_seem_to be cooking fresh good up until the_end
all_of the_food_here_is usually pretty_good
not_usually spicy_but all the_flavors_are still there
and their_garlic_naan here is_one_of_the_best
the_service_is really_good everyone chips in to_make_sure the_food stays full_and your glass is never empty
i'm_always seated quickly here and_i_have_to_say they've really stepped it_up
i_can now officially recommend_this_place again
although_it is_still not_my_favorite
i_love really_spicy indian_food_and they_don't deliver that here
i_will_definitely hit this_place_for_a quick indian fix
back again for_the_lunch_buffet
all chicken_curries and_no fish this_time
yes
i'm on_my rd plate of_food_and slowly getting_the itus
lol
if_you_don't know what itus is
google it
saffron is a_wonderful indian_restaurant
the_ambiance_is very elegant and_warm
it_makes you_want_to stay or get a_drink at_the nice bar
the_buffet
and let's face it buffets_are why we eat_indian in the_first_place
was well_stocked with a_variety_of delicious
perfectly spiced dishes
the nan_bread was_some of_the_best_i've_had
just light enough but very_filling
the food_was_decent and_the_garlic naan_was_great
my_main problem was with_the_service
during_the_lunch hour
there_were few people restaurant
despite_the small crowd
the_server_was inattentive
the_biggest problem came at the_end_of_the_meal
our_party had_a gift_certificate from restaurant
com for dollars
saffron refused to honor the gift_certificate and claimed that_the gift cards from restaurant
com could_only be used at_night
i_asked_the server where on the_website and on_the gift card the restriction was located
and_he could_not point_out the clause
to those in my_party
it_felt like_the saffron pulled a bait and switch
it left all_of_us feeling disappointed
tried saffron twice
they_have_a few vegan items and_the_staff_was great letting us_know which items_were safe for_us
on our_first_visit the_food_was much better_than_the second
our_last meal tasted burnt
bhindi_masala
okra
while the_okra was_not overdone
the spices_were terrible
our other dish tasted chalky
much like_my failed attempts to_make curries using powder at_home
food was_also_very greasy
but_that_is expected with_many indian_dishes
might give_the another try when_i visit lv again
my mother likes her chicken_dishes so would likely go_back
delicious_food_and friendly_staff
the_first_time_i went i_was afraid of_what it_would_be like since_it's very hidden and_not_too busy_but
nevertheless
it_was_amazing
everything on_their_menu is_great
cheese_naan is_a_must
my girlfriends and_i go_out once_a_week to different restaurants_and we_decided_to give_this_place_a shot
i_must_say i really_enjoyed_it
it_wasn't_too busy so we_were_seated_immediately
the_food_was_delicious and the_portion_sizes were sizable
i_was_able_to take some home which_was great
the dinners do_not come_with naan_which_was surprising so_i_ordered garlic_and cheese_naan for the_table_and i was_more_than happy to_pay extra
it_was_wonderful
give_this_place_a try
youll enjoy_it
this_place_is_great
especially for_dinner
the_food_is authentic
the_service_is_very personal
and_atmosphere is_great
however
i_would_not suggest going for_the_lunch_buffet
i_have_been a_few_times_and was_disappointed
the_best time to_go is_definitely for_dinner
you_will_not_be_disappointed
good_food
i've_only been for_the_lunch_buffet
but_everything they_had was_amazing
you_have the option_of plain or garlic_naan with_the_buffet
the_garlic_naan_is delicious
great_service
even_though_we had_a carafe of_water on_our_table
the_waiter would still come_by to_fill our glasses while_we_were talking or getting food
we_didn't have_any problems with buffet selections running out or_anything like_that
as_is mentioned in other_reviews
i'll definitely be_back
amazing friendly_staff
very_clean
and the_food_was_amazing
i_cant say ive ever_had such great_indian_food
far_from my_house
but_definitely worth_the_drive
delicious
onion baji is out_of_this_world
veggie_korma is_my_favorite
sauces_are rich_and plentiful
portions_are generous_and filling
owner_and chef insist of higher quality foods and_drinks
the_only_downside is_that_the service lacked regarding refilling water_and drinks
my_mouth was_on fire and_i mostly had an_empty water_glass next_to me_for the_meal
overall
i_would_highly_recommend this for_someone who enjoys
clean
affordable
and_tasty indian_food from_the northern region
i_would_say that_indian is_one_of_my cuisine types where i_am extremely picky and exacting
there_are_no many examples of_tandoori spices_and curries which seen hastily thrown together
in_las_vegas there_are_no shortage of_these types
saffron unfortunately falls into_this category
everything_was okay
hence the_three star_review
but_really nothing stood out
something like the_tandoori_chicken were_very_good
while the_curries_were thin_and only mildly flavorful
i'm not_sure i_will come_back
it_is only blocks away from my_house so_i may give_it_a try_again when_i get the_indian craving
i_would_recommend mt_everest on_sahara or mozen at mandarin oriental for top quality_indian in_the_city
my_friends_and_i enjoyed every dish_that_was ordered
the_garlic_naan_was amazing
will_definitely be_back
we_enjoyed the_butter_chicken which turned_out_to be our_favorite
the chicken_tika_masala was_also_good
had the_garlic_naan_bread but wasn't very_much garlic
the_place_was busy_but well staffed
bar tender was inviting when_we_walked_in the_door
located_in an unsuspecting strip_mall right_off and craig rd
i_would_definitely come_back_and try_more again
here we go_again
this_place_has awesome garlic_naan
as of late
i_haven't_been yelping a_lot but with_this trend of hitting an_indian_lunch_buffet every_week
i_feel the need to_share
this_is only a_lunch_buffet review
after_a disappointing experience last_week at a_different establishment
that_we drove halfway across the_city for
i'm glad to_write a_review about_the_place closest to where i_live
saffron_flavors_of_india has_a_good lunch_buffet
let me explain
first_off
the_service_is_great
the_staff_is attentive_and_friendly
always nice to_see great_service from anyone in_this town
secondly
the food_selection was_good_and_the items themselves were_fresh
not dried out
like_some tandoori_chicken at_other establishments
and_the_garlic_naan is_awesome
last
the_place_is_clean
there's really something to_be said for_this
i've_been_to some other_places and_the glasses
or the_water
are cloudy
or the_buffet itself isn't appealing due_to spilled items next_to_the buffet_or on_the_floor
etc
while this may_not be the_biggest place or have the_biggest selection_of items
the_place_is_clean and_well organized
now with those things said
i'm_sure there_are those_of you who may be thinking
hey
i_read a_few_other reviews and_they mentioned that_there weren't that many_items on_the_lunch_buffet
i sort of agree
then_again
consider that the_items they_have available are_not always the_same items day in_and day out_and that_the things_that are on_the_buffet have great_flavor
it's
for_the_lunch_buffet
it's_not some huge dinner feast
and it's_not
will_get you_a sandwich and a_drink at the_place across_the_street and_this_is a_much better option for_the_same money
also
if you_were thinking_about_it
since_i mentioned sandwiches
the_bread here
the_garlic_naan
is_really_good
i really_need to_come_here for_dinner
i'm_sure it's probably just_as_good if_not better_than their_lunch_buffet
as for_the_price
is_fine
we're in_vegas_and typically anything worth anything is
if_it's
and it_comes_with great_service
well
there ya go
honestly
i'd probably pay
for_a_few baskets of their_garlic_naan
i_have_been_here twice to_make_sure it_wasn't a fluke
this_place_is behind a mcdonalds and in_a business type building but don't_be fooled
it has_a_great staff_and it's_one_of the_more elegant indian_places i've_been_to
most are somewhat eclectic
the_food i_can_only say i've tried things
the_shrimp and_rice
non spicy
very_flavorful_and moist
both_times
the_garlic_nan
a_must
it's not_too garlicy
vegie samosa with dips
these_were not_greasy at_all
they_were_not dry whatsoever
i_will take_my picky ass husband next_time and_make him eat_here
and he_will like_it
where do_i begin
this_is_by_far the_best_indian_restaurant i_have ever_been_to
i've long been a_fan_of_indian cusine but_was weary about my_boyfriend testing it_out
i_need not_have worried though because i_think he might_have enjoyed_it more_than i_did
the_food_was the_best_i've_ever_had
and_the_service_was_great
the_dining_room was_a_little warm
but_it_was beautifully decorated and_had_a nice_atmosphere
i_cannot_wait till our next_visit to_vegas because this will_be our_first meal
it's_a_nice escape from_the_strip but isn't inconveniently out_of_the way
parking_is easily accessible and_it_is located_in_a safe area
we_love saffron
best_indian_food_in_vegas
my_friends and_i_went_to saffron on_a_friday evening and_we_were the_first ones there as the_restaurant does not open for_dinner until
pm
this_was nice because we_were_able_to take in the_ambiance of warm tones and seating options
as more_people began_to arrive
i_was grateful they seated the families with children in_the_back area
while seating the after work crowd with drinks in the_front
i_ordered_the vegetable_korma
heat option_of
and_garlic_naan
i_enjoy spicy_food
so the_vegetable_korma was_a_good balance_of spice_and creamy coconut sauce
however
my_friends who_are meat_eaters
ordered the_mixed saffron platter and_shrimp masala thought the_heat option_of was_more_than_enough
the_paneer in the_korma had an_excellent flavor_and i_cannot_wait to_try other_dishes with_it on my_next_visit
as other_reviews have stated
the_garlic_naan_is amazing
the_garlic had_a fresh flavor_and the_bread_was perfect_for scooping the_korma
for_dessert
we_ordered_the galub jamun
you_will_get three
honey balls in rose syrup
and_they_are quite_tasty
the_perfect end to a_great_meal
as_a suggestion
if_you_are going with_a_group_of or_more
you_will_be fine ordering a_few_dishes and sharing them family_style
with dishes
two_orders_of garlic_naan
two_orders_of rice
and two_orders_of galub jamun
there was_more_than_enough food_for_the of_us and we_even took some home
went_there_for lunch to_try_the_buffet and_the_food tasted amazing
my_only complaint_was that_they could_not keep the_food_on_the line
i_had very_little of_what they_had to_offer the_first go round
and_even less was_available the_second_time up
so
i_think next_time i'll just order_off them menu
i_would totally recommend_this_restaurant
the_ambiance_is nice
the_service_was_good and the_food_is_excellent
however
the_food portions are_a_little small
if you plan_on sharing order a_few plates
if you_cannot make_up your mind i_would_recommend the_mixed platter which_was_delicious
it includes a_bit_of everything
chicken
lamb
shrimp and pork
also_the spice_is very_hot
so_if_you dont like heat make_sure_you get_it at_a or
this_place_has decent_food
but_is way_too over_priced
per plate for mostly masala_and no meat
unacceptable
sad cause the_food isn't bad
also the_wait_staff_is condescending and_not attentive
beware you_walk_in with adult and kids they_are going_to consider you a_party_of and hit you with gratuity
you've been warned
super_spicy
the_food_is_delicious_and the_staff_are nice
when_they ask you_in a_scale_of one_to ten how_spicy
be_careful if_you_go above five
it_will_be spicy
great_place_for veg_and vegans
the_saag aloo is_delicious
this_place_is sensational
i_have_been looking_for_good indian_cuisine near me
and_this_place hit_the_spot
the_atmosphere_is_nice and cozy
the_meats are cooked and_spiced to_perfection
the_curry is everything you_would hope and expect_from good indian_cuisine
my_favorite_dish that we_ordered_was the combination platter of_meat
which_included some_of_the better seasoned meats i've purchased in_a_very long time
my_only gripe is the_portions in relation to the_price
it_is a_little_pricey for_the small amount_of_food that_you_get
if the_portions got bigger or the_price_was reduced
i_would_be eating_here very frequently
as_is
i don't_feel like spending on_a meal_for two all_that often
i_tried_this restaurant for_the_first_time today and_it_is the_best_indian_food_i_have had_in_las_vegas
the prices_are_reasonable and_the_portions_are a_good size
i_would_definitely_recommend saffron to_anyone_looking_for a_great_indian_restaurant
our family was craving_some indian_and this_spot was_well reviewed and close_to_home
the_decor was_nice_and the_service_was_very_good
but_the_food_was unfortunately okay
the_samosas_were good
the_tikka_masala_was good
the_tandoori_chicken came out cold_and undercooked
usually that dish comes_out sizzling on_the iron skillet
but we_had_to send ours back because_it_was cold
perhaps the_worst dish we_had_was the_one part_of indian that we_all love the_most the_naan_bread
the_naan here_is thin_and almost seems store bought
we may return for_a_quick indian fix but_this_was certainly_not our best experience eating_indian_food
ok
i swear i_have_a serious food addiction
its one_of_my_favorite subjects to talk_about on_a daily basis
and_i actually get_a high from eating
but_all foods are_not the_same
the_feeling i_get from_one food may be far greater than_that of a_different food
case in point
curry provides me_with one_of_the strongest highs i_know
but_not all curries_are created equal
a thai curry_is far different_from the_curries in_an_indian_restaurant
either way curry is_a comfort_food to_me
it_is astounding how one meal can change ones mood so completely and_curry fits that profile
tonight i_had_a more mild curry_at saffron_flavors_of_india
more so_i_had a_full experience featuring curry
i started_with_the complimentary papadan and_two sauces of_which i_am_not all too familiar but_i_am a_fan_of nonetheless
i_also_ordered a_bottle_of taj_mahal pilsner style beer
for my_entree i_ordered butter_chicken and_a_side_of garlic_naan
the_naan_was warm
chewey and_perfect as_always
it was_the_perfect accompanyment to_the buttery rich chicken_curry_with a_touch of tomato
the_high from_this meal_was such that my_eyes were half closed and_i_had_a soft grin on_my face during the_entire meal
i_was experiencing a sort of nirvana
and why stop there
i_had_my opener
my side
my_entree and my_drink all of_indian origin
it_was time_to round out the_evening with dessert
i_thought_i should trybthe galub jaman
there_were two fried dough balls served_in_a warm rose syrup and topped with_what seemed_to be dried coconut
it_was_very sweet but insanely delicious_as everthing i_had tonight was
this_was_one_of_the_best meals i_have_had in_a_long_time
this_is_the stuff dreams are made_of
maybe its just the_beer talking
nah
this has_to_be the_second best indian_restaurant_in_vegas and_there_are probably a_dozen of_indian_restaurants
i_hope this_restaurant gets the recognition it serves
the_food_is_fresh_and the restraint is_clean
they_have_a garlic cheese_naan to_die_for and_their chili paneer is_amazing
i_just hope this_restaurant stays open because_i only see two tables or three filled every_time_i go
i_just love_this_place
the_food
the_drinks
the_staff
this makes_me happy
even_when dining with_friends
everybody walks away_in a_delicious food_coma with leftovers
i_suggest anything in_their red curry paired with_a kingfisher beer
saffron_flavors_of_india is_amazing
this_is_the_best_indian_food
also this_restaurant_is so clean_and very special care is taken with_the_food
the_staff_is so wonderful as_well
simply put saffron_flavors_of_india is_simply the_best
i_can't_wait for_the curry_leaf to_open up_in downtown las_vegas across from_the container park
these people know_how_to make great_indian_food and_are incredible restaurateurs
racheal martindale
legit indian_food right here
located_on west craig and_the
inside a_tiny strip_mall opposite the gas station
if you blink you'll miss it
legitimate indian_food is_hard_to find in_las_vegas and_if_you do find half decent_food it's usually some_sort_of infused restaurant_that costs an arm and_a leg that's not_very_good
after realizing saffrons was closer than expected
i_decided_to_give it_a_shot and_wasn't disappointed
every_time i_have_been_here for_lunch_buffet
dinner or picking_up
the_quality_and standards of_this business are stars each and every_time
my recommendations are_the rogan ghosht
lamb_vindaloo_and the_garlic_naan are_all top shelf
the_bar at_the_front of house is_also not_a_bad little bar
with large lcd screen with whatever sport you_want
also it's_a_nice place_to knock back_a kingfisher while waiting_for friends
the_service_is also a_fairly oiled machine
decor_is fairly simple_and nothing outlandish that_you come_to expect_from a_lot_of good five_star places on_the_strip
i realize i'm pumping this business up
and_i truly do believe its a_star indian_restaurant
indian_restaurants_are one of_those hit_or_miss kinda places_that can give_you amazing quality or cardboard
so until they start_to pump out run of_the mill stuff i'll keep_it at stars
overall
price
out_of
cleanliness
drink
basic bar

wonderfully flavored dishes

friendly_service
you'll want_to order plenty so_that you'll have enough to_take_home for leftovers the_next_day
saffron_flavors_of_india is_a rarity because so few indian_restaurants_are located_in northwest las_vegas
i've_been_to saffron several_times for_the_lunch_buffet_and during_dinner
and_have_never been_disappointed with the_quality_of_the_food
the_lunch_buffet_is on_the small side but is_only
drink included
the_buffet has plenty of option_for vegetarians as_well
i_always order_from_the vegetarian_menu during_dinner
which_has a_wide array_of options to_choose_from
i last ordered_the mattar_paneer
a curry_dish with_peas and_spices
you_can customize your level_of spiciness from a_scale_of to
if_you're_not a_fan_of spicy foods
i'd_recommend staying under_a for_sure
for a_group_of
we_were immediately seated_and shortly after provided with_a pitcher of_water with ice and_what i_can_only describe as paper like tortilla chips with_two dipping_sauces
the_service_is generally alright
but sometimes we've experienced servers disappearing on_us and long_wait times on refills
otherwise
the_servers_are friendly_and polite
if service_was more attentive
i'd_definitely give_this_place stars
when_our dinners arrived
the_server placed a_single petite rice plate for_all four_of us to_share
that rice_was gone in_an instant and_we_had to_order another rice bowl
other_than_that small minor inconvenience
everyone loved_their dinners
i_love_the ambiance of_the_restaurant it's decorated well_and feels intimate
there's_also indian music_playing in_the_background
saffron is_my_favorite_indian_restaurant and_is close_to_home
more importantly
the_food_is_amazing
my_personal recommendations are the_garlic_naan
and vegetable_samosas
i_will_definitely_be_back to_get_my next fix of_indian_food
st time_here
st time having_indian_food
i_have_to_say i really_enjoyed_it
we_had fried_cheese for appetizer
i_had shrimp bayuri with_rice
it_was_really_good
all_of_it
i_will_definitely return_to try_other options
the_service_was_great_and the_atmosphere_was great_as_well
very enjoyable experience_for a rookie
st time_here_and st time trying_indian_food
it_was_a_very pleasant experience
i really_enjoyed_the_food
the_service
and_the_atmosphere
it_is tucked in_a_small strip_mall behind_the cvs on craig rd right_off_the
food_was a_little_pricey but_i_have nothing_to actually compare it_to
had_the fried_cheese for appetizer
shrimp bayuri for_main course with_garlic_naan
definitely_will try_again
st time_here_and st time having_indian_food
i_have_to_say it_was_pretty_good
portions_were decent size
had_the fried_cheese for appetizer and_shrimp bayuri for_dinner
it_was hot nd spicy
they let you_choose your level_of hotness
definitely worth_going back
it_was kinda hard_to find
it_is tucked behind_the cvs in_a_strip_mall off craig rd neaar
atmosphere was_great_and service_was too
i've been too saffron quite a_few_times the_staff_are very pleasent the food_is_tasty the_ambiance_is relaxed i higly reccomend
driving through lv after_a_long vacation we_decided_to end our vacation with_some delicious_indian_food
the_lunch_buffet_was pretty_good and_for a_decent price
we enjoyed_the_food and_the_service_was_great
the_chicken was_a_little dry in one_of_the_dishes but_it_was_still delicious
we'll be_back
great_place
we_have_eaten here_several_times and_have enjoyed_it every_time
i love_the_chicken jalfrezi and_garlic_naan
after hiking at mount charleston
four_of us stopped here to_try_their lunch_buffet
one_of_our group has_been here_before and recommended it
it_was_a_good recommendation
the_buffet_is small_but is_in_the size range_of others
at
it's price_is ok
not_the cheapest
not the_most expensive
the_restaurant_is attractive with comfortable seating
there_is_a separate section through which you_enter where the_bar is_located
the_buffet_is in_an adjoining area out_of view from the_dining_room
there_was_a selection_of salad
yogurt
chutney
and_desserts at the_beginning of_the_buffet
after_the initial bar
there_were several chafing dishes_with various foods
i_tried_the chicken_tikka_masala
a curry_chicken
dal_makhani
onion pakora
and_some fried_chicken balls the_name_of which i_can't_remember
accompanying this_was basmati_rice
for the_most_part
the_dishes_were good and_flavorful
the_dal was_bland
it_could have_used some seasoning
the_chicken balls were_tasty and_different
i_should_have gotten some chutney for_that and the_onion pakora but_i failed to_do_so
next_time
one_of_our group noted that the_chicken_tandoori was_dry
i_didn't try_this but noted this_for future reference
i_made a_second trip_to the_buffet_to get something sweet to offset my disposition
i_got one gulab_jamun and_it_was_very_good
it_was_quite soft
and_it_was not_overly sweet
a_very_nice ending to_lunch
service_was average
we_were_there when the_restaurant opened_and it soon got busy but_there_were a_couple_of people_working the_small room
when_i_went to_get_my gulab
my dirty plate was_not removed
other_than this
things went ok
if_i'm in_the_area
i'd certainly stop again
it_is in_the_middle tier of_indian buffets_i've tried
since_it's the_closest place_to where i_live
i'll be_back
i_wouldn't recommend coming_from the_other side_of_town for_the_buffet when there_are other_places just_as_good or better in_the unlv area
this_was a_great_find in_vegas
a_friend recommended seek this_place_out and_it_was totally worth_the_drive
i_shared a_few of_the_curries with_some garlic_nan and spring rolls
all_were very_flavorful
the_menu_was expansive
inufing a_few indo_chinese fusion dishes_and a_fair selection_of_vegetarian
if_you_are_in vegas and_have_a taste for_indian_cuisine
you_should stop_here
the muter paneer was_a_bit runny for_me but tasted ok
as main entree i_had_the karahi murghi keema massalla
which_was good_but_not awesome
it's somewhat odd to_see only western dessert in_the_menu
but nevertheless the_one_i had
something with biscuit and ice_cream
was_excellent
will_give a try_again in_the_future
close_to_the marriott
easy walking distance
but_they deliver for_anything over pounds
order online
food_arrived fast_and very_hot
food_was_good quality for_the_price spicy mushrooms were_excellent

indian_food_in north scottsdale
yea
same corner as mastro's and walgreen's
i'm looking_to go_again
and_see if_they rate another_star
after the_start up issues dissolve
i ordered_garlic naam bread_and chicken_tika_masala
both very_good_and nicely presented
prices_are_reasonable
for_this neighborhood
only open for_dinner
and_no weekend_buffet is planned yet
we_were at_the park behind mastro's with_the twins
we_decided_to walk around this plaza to_check_out if there_were any new places
we_saw this_new indian_pakistani restaurant
it_looked really_nice_and i_was_not sure i_wanted_to subject them to_my twins
they_are_not bad
however they_are two_years old after_all
they_were_very nice and_accommodating
they_were even gracious enough_to remove the tablecloth
my baby girl thinks she is_a magician or_something because she wants_to pull tablecloths all_the_time
we_placed one order_of chicken_pakora for_the twins
i_was_not sure they_would eat
well
they gobbled it_all up_in seconds
i_couldn't believe_it
so we_placed a_second order
we_also_had_the regular_naan and the_aloo naan
both very_yummy
i_had the_samosas_and my_husband_had_the chicken karachi
very_tasty
we_will_be_back it_was_a_great experience
i_am_so happy i_don't_have to travel miles and miles to_find a_great_indian_restaurant
nice people
great_food
a_really_nice white linen place
loved the_chicken karachi
naan
samosas
chicken_pakora
wife_had a_lovely red
i had_a_nice premium margarita
good_food
worst service on earth
staff has_no idea_what is_in their_food
manager argued when_we_got bill with multiple errors
too_bad we_will never_go_back because_of horible experience because food_was_pretty_good
walked out shaking our heads at_how poorly trained the_staff_is
went_to_this_place on_a_friday_night
it_is relatively new so_there weren't alot_of people there_but a_decent enough crowd
decor_was more_like generic italian restaurant than indian
but again it's new
the_food_was_great
good_indian_food_in north scottsdale finally
we_had_the lamb tandoori and_chicken_curry and_both_were excellent
along_with the_garlic_naan we_ate every_bite
the wine_list was_a_bit short and unimaginative
and_you couldn't really order side_dishes of many_things like paneer_and such
but perhaps these will evolve
we'll definately be_back
excellent_indian_food
very_fresh_and subtley spiced_and cooked
much better_than most
relaxed and upscale atmosphere
pretty busy on_a wed night
highly_recommended
went_there last_night with_a_group
everyone really_liked_the food_and_the_service was_excellent
we_shared different_dishes
the_lamb masala_was particularly_good
as_was_the tandoor chicken_tikka
this_is_the_best_indian_food we have_found in_the_valley
our_group has been_to_many indian_restaurants_in england
canada and elsewhere
the_decor_is a_little plain
but is_clean_and new
second try_for al_hamra and_again we_really liked_it
great_flavors
lots_of spice
i'd agree_with a previous poster that_there_is alot_of sauce for_a relatively small amount of meet
but_the sauce_is soooo good all you_need is a_little_more rice_or naan_and you_are good to_go
this_time tried_the samoas deep_fried so not_my_favorite
like_the m baked better
also the_lamb byrini was_just_ok
the_rice_was a_little greasy for_my_taste
however the_chicken_curry_and paneer tilkka masala_were spot_on and very_delicious
plus some ofhte best garlic_naan i've ever_had
we'll definately go backand it_is nice to_have_some good ethnic alternatives in_the far north valley
nice meal and_good_service
very_good_indian_food
this_is what scottsdale is lacking
slightly pricey and they_charge for some_of_the extras you_get for_free at other_indian_restaurants
but_overall very_very_good
highly_recommended
i_have_been twice
the_first_time was during their pre grand opening and the_food_was_good
i_went_back again last_week
the_food_was_fantastic
i_eat home_cooked indian vegetarian_food couple_times a_week so_i'm picky
the vegi dishes_were twice as_good as any_other_indian place in_az
the_price_is higher
but reasonable for the_location
the roti_and naan_is also_very_good
was_just in_az for vacation with my_mom and_went here_after purchasing a_restaurant
com gift_certificate
we thoroughly_enjoyed it
location seems off_the beaten path at least for_us tourists staying in north phoenix
definitely hard_to find_in the dark thank god for gps
we_went_on_a sunday_night place was_fairly dead
i_think there were_only other_tables dining while_we_were there
it_is_a fairly large restaurant esp for_being in_a shopping_center
we_ordered_the samosas
regular_naan
chicken lorna for_me_and coconut_chicken for my_mom
the_samosas_and naan_were the_best_i had ever_had
the_naan_was super light
fluffy_and warm
the_samosas had_a_nice crunchy outside not soggy and_chewy like at a_lot_of other_indian_restaurants
the_chicken_was cooked_perfectly very_tender and sauce had_a_lot_of flavor
i've dined at several indian_restaurants
in boston primarily
and_this_was my_favorite
my_mom had_only had_indian once before
with_me in boston
and_she didn't_care_for it_so she_was hesitant to try_it_again but_she really liked_it
although neither of_us_were starving when_we_got there
i_still think the_portions_were enough_for meals
our_waitress_was quiet_and shy to_start but warmed up after awhile
we_ended_up really liking her she_was quite friendly
i_don't recall her name but she_was from serbia
would_definitely_recommend_this_place
fabulous food
i_had_the chicken_tikka_masala_and my_mom had the_lamb_korma
i_went
not_so hungry
but cleaned my whole plate
service_was_very_friendly
we_took the take_out menus home
as this_would_be_a perfect alternative_to the_usual rotisserie chicken_or chinese take_out
north scottsdale has needed a_good_indian_restaurant since_i moved_here twelve years_ago
my_wife_and_i dined at al_hamra a_couple_of days_ago and_can report that_our demand has at last been met
seeing a vindaloo on_the_menu had_me correctly guess that the_chef had arrived in_the usa via britain
which_has a_long history of_indian_cuisine
we started_with samosas after which_i had_the_lamb_vindaloo and_my_wife tried the_chicken_korma
all very_good
for_dessert
we_were presented with_a complimentary rice_pudding
also_good
prices_are in_line with the_location expect_to_pay a_bit_more here_in_the pricey north scottsdale location
decor was_a_bit nondescript really very little_indian character and in_my_opinion needs a_bit_more attention_to set_the tone of_the_place
nearly full restaurant_on my_visit
very_polite service
they_take their heat seriously
as the_mint_chutney was a_solid on_a_scale of
saag_and chana_masala were flavorful_and good portions
plain_naan is_the winner on_the bread menu
for price_and taste
didn't_care_for the_garlic_naan so_much
restaurant_is tucked behind two_other restaurants
a lamp pizza place and_a bistro
easy_to miss
prices_are insanely steep and beyond the norm for this_area
entrees include
premium
rice
dinner only
friendly_service and_comfortable setting
hasn't been crowded on any of_our three visits during past month
consistently good_food_and value for_the_price
we appreciate_the diversity it_has helped add_to the pinnacle peak restaurant scene
we_will keep_coming back
great high end indian_restaurant_in_the phoenix scottsdale area
expect_to_pay more_for the_location
order the_tandoori_chicken_and anything vindaloo
dishes_are pricey_but good
service_is_great especially from_the cute eastern european waitress
stay away if_you_are really hungry_and on_a budget
i learned to love_indian when_i loved in_london for_years
this_place_is_a train wreck
it_is abv
appallingly bad value
over
priced
they_even charge for papadoms
horriible service_and decidedly marginal food
we_were a_party_of three
only_two other_tables were occupied when_we_arrived
although_it_was almost full when_we_left
minutes_after we_ordered_the waitress brought our rice
minutes later
the_first entree arrived
ten_minutes later
the_second arrived
minutes later
the_third
i_ordered lamb_vindaloo
now vindaloo
by definition
when authentic
is_so hot it will_take off the_top_of your head
but_i get_it
this_is arizona
were veal is exotic
and_so i_was_not surprised to_be asked_how spicy i_wanted it
on_a to scale
i_asked_for
the_dish i_got was_a
at_best
no_spice at_all
the_rest_of_the food was_mediocre as_well
and_this_place_is expensive
caveat emptor
we_have_been looking_for_a_good indian_restaurant in_phoenix scottsdale
thus far we_have_been disappointed at the_quality
al_hamra was a_complete delight
lovely
simple
clean decor
polite service
and_the_food_was delish
so often i_find indian_food_is swimming in oil
we_had an eggplant curry_and_a chana massala and_both_were wonderful
their papadum and_naan
especially
were wonderful
if_you_are vegan or vegetarian_and want a_nice meal
i_would_highly_recommend this_restaurant
they can_make your_food spicey or mild
and
if_you_have meat eating friends there_are many
many excellent selections
so_nice to_eat_in a civilized restaurant_that offers tasty
well prepared food at_reasonable_prices
delightful restaurant
had_the_lamb sagg
heat
and my_daughter had the_chicken_tiki marsala
heat
we_both enjoyed_the selection_and appreciated the_free appetizer with sauce
heat
to know_how_to gauge the_heat index
the_garlic_naan_was outstanding
and our_server_was friendly_and_helpful
will_definitely be_back
oh al_hamra
i_love your chicken_tikka_masala_and naan like no other
the_service_is wonderful and_the_decor delightful
and_the wine_list extensive
but please
forbthe love of god
play some music
it_is_so quite in_there that the_other patrons discussions
clear across_the room seem loud and distracting
they_need music to create ambience_and privacy
its almost akward
great_food here
i_will_say its a_little_pricey but_i_guess on par for the_location
i_will defiantly be_back
i've_been_to this_place twice now
and it_does not_disappoint
everything i've_had
mostly the lamb_dishes
has_been incredibly tasty_and tender
the_staff at al_hamra are very_nice_and attentive
they_make good recommendations and_don't hover over you as you_eat
the decor_is_nice
fairly standard
but_not down market by_any_means
after_all
it_is_in a_decent area surrounded by high income rooftops
the_only_problem i_have is i_wish more_people would_go
i've_only been_on weeknights so i_can't_speak to_the
hopefully busy
weekend crowd
but_this_place could use a_couple more_people discovering it_and becoming loyal customers
it_is pricey
which may_be_a result of the_location
but_it's better_than most_other indian places_i've_been
give it_a_shot and_you won't_be_disappointed
that_really good_indian_restaurant_in the_phoenix_area has eluded us we've tried at least that_were supposed_to be
it
so this_time no_one recommended al_hamra it's_just been_on my_way home_for as along as_it's been_open
it_was_worth stopping very_good lamb_vindaloo
spice_level packing some heat
and a_variety_of other_dishes that we_tried
my_wife liked the_samosa but_i_was thinking 'so so'
all in_all_the chef has_a fine touch and the_food_is_very solid and_well above_average
although a_bit_pricey
as you_might expect for the_location
most_of_the recommendations by others seem spot_on
recommended
stoped by on sunday_night
only_two tables in_the_place bad sign
harried fustrated waitress ordered a_beer out_of stock
second choise out_of stock
asked_for chutney out_of stock
ordered_lamb kebob out_of stock
i_am seeing a trend here
had three entrees they_were ok i_really wish there was_a_great indian_place_in scottsdale any recommendations
give al ham
ra a skip
my_boyfriend_and_i frequent this little_indian restaraunt often
the_wait_staff_is always super helpful when_we want to_try_new items_and are_all very_kind
try_their fish coconut we can't get_enough of_it
their_naan with_chicken is_also_a crowd favorite
this is_hands_down one_of_the nicer looking indian_restaurants_in_the city
located_in_a very upscale part_of_town
it keeps up by having very_good ambience_and very professional service
all_this comes at_a price
literally
this_is also one_of_the priciest indian_restaurants_in_the city
the_food by that standard not the_most amazing i_have_ever eaten
the_food_is satisfactory though
i_had_the_lamb biryani_and the_chicken_makhani which were_both done good
so come_here_for a fancy night_out when_you_are prepared to_pay more_for a_decent meal
if
however
all_you are craving_for is_good old indian_cuisine_and do not_want_to burn a_hole in_your pocket
there_are_plenty_of other alternatives in_the_city
easily our fave indian_joint in_town
deep rooted spices
never disappointed_with any_of_the curries
samosas_are divine and_naan done right
a_must_try for_all indian_cuisine lovers
palak_paneer and benghan bartha were wayyy too_salty for anyone's taste
not_sure if_it_was msg or salt but_it left us feeling a_little ill after_dinner and we_could barely eat any of_it
the_garlic_naan_was delicious and_the_rice_was good
the_waitress seemed hurried and not_as hospitable as_one would_expect
this_is_a_great restaurant and_i_don't understand why it_isn't busier
the_location_is great being just off_of pinnacle peak and pima rd
unlike many_indian_restaurants the_decor
crystal
plates
silverware are really_nice_and elegant
they_have lovely indoor and outdoor dining options
the_cuisine is_simply outstanding
the_quality_of_the sauces
meats
vegetables is top_notch
our_waitress_was delightful and_the_owner manager came to_our_table and_he was_very_nice_and knowledgeable about his cuisine_and indian_cuisine in_general
this_place_has to catch on because i_get_the feeling that if_it started getting packed
it_would_be one_of_the more popular restaurants_in northern scottsdale
we_will_be regulars
disappointed on valentine's day
what_a bummer
have been_wanting_to try this_place_for_a year
we drive_by it_on_the way_home every_day
my_wife found a_groupon deal
so_we bought
followed the_groupon instructions
m th only
only to_be told after our_meal that_they would_not honor the_groupon
aside from the_groupon mess
the_service_was extremely slow
the_food
while tasty
was_way overpriced_for what we've found elsewhere in_phoenix
restaurant_is nice enough
tablecloths
good silverware
and our_waiter_was working really hard
unfortunately
there_were way_too many tables trying_to be_served by one guy
i_won't mention alternatives here
but_we have_found a_wonderful
affordable vegetarian indian_restaurant_in_town
for_a vegetable_curry dish is_a_bit much
even_if it_is n scottsdale
maybe it_was because_of valentine's day
but_no indian families in_the_place
the_other place we_love is_always full_of indian families
kinda tells me something
horrible service
we_had_to_wait minutes_for the_waiter_to acknowledge us
the_food_is ok
we had_dinner_here the_other_night and really_enjoyed ourselves
the_food_was_very_good and the_service_was_excellent
have_not had much luck with indian_restaurant
this_was_a very welcome surprise
we eat_here pretty regularly the_food_is consistently good and_there_are a_good_variety_of options covering many regional dishes
including many great_vegetarian options_as you_would_expect for indian_fare
i've been_to_india and_indian enclaves throughout asia
and_the_food_is consistent with the_real thing
the_heat spiciness is_also consistent with how they_serve it in_india
i
e
hot is hot
they ask_for your your heat preference
so for_your first_visit you_may want_to dial it_back a notch from_what you_might normally request locally
the_place_is big_and clean_and bright
but as_others note there's not a_ton_of character
service_is_friendly
and_we come enough_that they recognize us_and welcome us back
as_some have noted it_can_be a_bit_slow at_times
not always
but i_think_it's consistent with_the_food being prepped fresh to_order
full disclosure
i_was born and raised in_the sub continent so my_expectations are_quite different_from the_average joe who's view of_authentic mexican_food istaco bell or of_authentic italian pizza is pizza hut
i provide these qualifications because_my comments may be from_a very_different perspective
for american indian_food it's okay
for the_real old country food it deserves no more_than_a star
s that's the story
we_just returned from dining at al_hamra with_friends and_had_to comment on_the great_meal and_service we_had
mario
our_waiter
was knowledgeable and_friendly
our_orders came promptly and_all were_excellent
we_ordered the_samosas_and onion paneer for_appetizers
we_had_the shrimp_vindaloo
the_chicken with coconut
the_chicken_curry_and the eggplant_dish along_with aloo naan_and mango_chutney
all had the_right_amount_of spice as ordered and_were tender and_very_tasty
it's_been several years since_we dined at al_hamra but we_will_definitely go_back
no lack_of flavors at_this_restaurant
the_naan was_some_of the_best_i've_ever_had
other notables were_the bhindi_masala
palak_paneer
and_aloo ghobi
the_tandoori meats were_delicious
all items_are cooked to_your spice_level
we chose four and_that_was plenty
halfway through dinner
i shifted into sport eating mode and_got myself one helluva tummy ache on_the drive home
it_was_that good
i'm paying_for it today
well
not_really
my_wife is
lamb_korma and_garlic_naan_were the_best_i_have_ever tried
food_has it_is unique flavor_and by far
the_best_indian_food_i ever_had
superb mughal classics
served_with great style in_a gentle and_relaxing atmosphere
great wine_list
too
which indian_restaurants often lack
prices_are higher than_most neighborhood curry_houses
but the_quality_of_the ingredients is_definitely_worth the splurge if you truly love_this cuisine
a_great_place
this_place_was fantastic
we_had great_service
the_waiter was_very_helpful and_friendly
he_made great recommendations too
i_had_the lamb_vindaloo_and my_husband_had_the chicken_tiki_masala
both were_very_tasty
we will_be_returning soon
the_food_here_is great
very_authentic
the_service however is horrible
two_of_us ate_here on_a_saturday_night
there_were only_two other_tables and_two waitresses
they both should be working somewhere_else
preferably where they_don't_have contact with other_people
their skills were_really lacking for_a hospitality business
i_hadn't had_indian_food in_years and a_group_of us decided to_make_it our ethnic food choice_for our get together
i_read the_yelp_reviews and_we_all went
i_can tell you it_was_all everyone said and_more
the_food
the_friendly service_and_the very_nice restaurant owner made our_experience one_to remember
the_chicken_tiki_masala
samosas
lamb_vindaloo_and everything_else_was full_of_flavor and_delicious
the_naan_was to due for too
this_is a_place_to put_on your favorites list
al_hamra is_a_nice indian_food_restaurant
that sounds like_a pretty basic statement but_that's kind of the_point
my_experience was_not remotely bad nor was_it remarkable
our_waitress_was attentive_and_friendly and_i_would give_it four_stars if it_wasn't for the_fact_that one_of_the_dishes we_ordered_was a_lamb_dish that was_overcooked
but_i took them home_for leftovers and_it_was oddly better
we_got chicken_tikka_masala
garlic_naan
and lamb_chops
chicken_tikka_was exactly as_i hoped and_the_garlic_naan was_perfect
it_was flavorful_and on par with_what ive had at_other establishments closer_to home
i_wouldn't order_the lamb_chops again_but id order curry_dishes without any hesitation and_be confident that_they_are good
the lamb_chops however as_i said previously were overcooked
if_you_are_in_the area than i_would_recommend trying it_out
its a_great looking place_with great staff but unfortunately is hidden_in the mastros complex so deep that_its more word_of mouth than_anything else
you certainly wouldn't drive_by and know its there
it_is however absolutely worth_trying if_you_have_a craving_for_indian_food
excellent
really good_indian_food
i_am non_indian but fan of_any type_of curries
i_have_tried almost_all the indian_restaurants_in_las_vegas
but_this_one has the_most different and_authentic tasting indian_food
they_have really_good biryani_and chicken_curries
plus point is_that_it_is in henderson
i_had food there last year but_it_wasn't good so_i stopped going_there
but_i_think_the owners have_been changed and_they_have created this into a_very_nice atmosphere with friendly_staff
i_am happy_that i_don't_have to_go far for_great tasting indian_food anymore
i_recommend taking your guests to_this_place
to_be perfectly honest
i_was slightly disappointed
call me obsessed
but i_came_in fully expecting to_see murgh makhani in one_of_the lunch_buffet trays
unfortunately
all_i saw was its boring cousin chicken_tikka_masala
on_the bright side
the absence of my_favorite_dish caused me_to_try a_lot_more than i_usually do
i_was happy_to_see goat_curry_and it_was_pretty_good
the_other dish_that stood out_for me_was_the mutter_paneer
i_didn't_care for the_cheese
but i_enjoyed_the peas_and the_curry_was a_decent dipping sauce for the_garlic_naan
this_is where murgh makhani excels imho
incidentally
i_did see murgh makhani on_the_menu
so_they definitely serve it
i_just_wish it_was_in the_lunch_buffet like at_namaste
for_that silly reason
i_give the edge to namaste
but taj_palace is_still a_ok
update
still no butter_chicken in the_lunch_buffet
however
i_did find a_new item that i_enjoyed quite_a_bit methi chicken
the_sign says the_dish contains spinach
if that's true
then it's_not methi chicken
maybe they_just figure it's easier to_write
spinach
than to_explain what
methi
is
in_any case
it_was_good
i've also discovered kheer
it's an_indian rice_pudding finished with_nuts
raisins
and cardamom
for_some_reason
i've_never_had this dessert before
but_it_is absolutely_delicious
despite butter_chicken still being mia
i_think a_star upgrade is in_order
so someone would call me crazy for yelping this_place_again and_i usually don't_even yelp
i_was_craving their_food again so had to_make another trip there
i_really had_a great_experience_and this_time i_went_with my guests and_they loved_it as_well
stars this_time because_i know the_staff_is really_friendly but_i_think_the person_who takes the_order just need_to speak up a_little_bit
he speaks so softly that_i_have hard time understanding so_i_am just hoping_for an enthusiastic person to_take my_order next_time
i_would_go again to_eat
went_there today and_let me_tell you that's one amazing buffet they_have or i_should say the_best indian_buffet_in_town
i have_no_idea how they_are surviving over items for_just
had_a chat_with the_chef and_he knows what_he is talking about especially when_it_comes_to food he_is one knowledgeable person
over_all awesome place_to_go_for buffet
i_am_going there_for_dinner tommorow with bunch_of friends_and looking_forward_to it
bit excited
long story short best_indian_food_in whole las_vegas hands down
henderson finally has a_good_indian_restaurant great_food with_a friendly_staff
it_very_much beats the_long drive to its best competitors in tough parts of_town
we've tried_the_buffet three_times and plan_on returning about every_other week
i_really_liked this_place a_lot
i_am_a little scared of_indian_food
because not_sure exactly_what_i am ordering
the_waiter_was really_nice_and explained everything
without being sarcastic
we_ordered a_couple_of things
that was_good
but next_time
their medium will defintely not_be okay
very_hot for_me
i_think mild next_time is_the key
i_love spicy_food but am_used_to the asian spicy so_this was_a_little much for_me
i_will pass on the_app platter too
and_go straight for the_samosas
which_were so_good
the_only_thing_that kinda sucked for_me that_it closed between lunch_and_dinner for_a_couple hours
whats up_with that
aren't we_still a hour town
lunch_and_dinner hours
what_is that
oh_and excellent mango lassies
tried their_lunch_buffet today and_thought it_was_pretty_good
the upside
they_have_a variety_of_dishes and choices for_vegetarians
yellow dal
they_had_a name for this_dish but_i forgot
it_was yellow lentils_and squash with tamarind and_spices
really_really yummy
i_had helpings
palak_paneer spinach_and cottage_cheese very_good
its a_bit spicy though
i_love spicy_food and found_it a_little extra_spicy
potato_and peas good
chana_masala good but_very oily
bhindi was_ok
i_make bhindi better
pakora i_had one_and thought_it_was too_much oil
tasted ok
they_had a_couple_of more vegetarian_dishes
i_think in_all
and_chicken lamb_dishes and rice_that i_did_not try
was_told that_they_were quite_good
i_also_tried the_mango chutney_and coriander chutney which tasted_great
they_had several more condiments available
the_raita yogurt with cucumber tasted_good too
the_server brought water_and asked_us what_kind_of naan we_wanted
unfortunately they did_not_have tandoori roti which_is_a healthier bread but who am_i kidding
there's nothing healthy about the_meal
well
with the_exception of the_salad
spinach_and yogurt i_guess
we_got naan_and it_was_good
it_had_a generous helping of butter so we_requested one without and_he brought_it out_quickly
the_naan_was crisp
fresh_and tasted amazing
the_restaurant_was quite busy_but the_server did a_good job keeping our glasses filled_with water_and asking if we_needed anything else
its definitely_one_of_the better_indian meals i've_had here_in_vegas
i enjoyed_the_food here_and the_servers_were very_nice
we_had_the chicken_tiki_masala and_lamb_vindaloo
both_were good
the_naan with the_onions were_delicious but the_onion bhajis was not_that_great
i'd go_back because_it's local
nothing really wowed me
personally
it's_the_best indian_food_i_have_ever experienced
my_friend
whom i dined with lived_in london when_she was younger and_enjoyed a_lot_of fantastic indian_food while she_was there
she_also quite enjoyed_it
we_had veggie_samosa
and chile naan_with chicken_tikka_marsala
the_staff_was really accommodating and_were very_helpful
i_will_say that we_ordered medium heat_and it_was_almost too_hot at_times
we agreed to level heat
loved_it but_will probably go_with or next_time
lol
anyhow
we_will_be_back for_the_lunch_buffet
after_a fabulous experience_at another indian_buffet_in_town
my_sister and_i_were very_excited to_try_this_place
it is_located next_to one_of_our fave thai places close_to our house
d we_were_not_disappointed
we_came a_half an_hour before the_lunch_buffet ended
i_recommend getting there a_bit earlier because_they seriously start_to remove food_at three on_the dot
the_naan_was fresh_and_delicious
the_sweet_rice was_yummy and the_tikka_masala was_to_die_for
i_could just eat_the sauce_on rice_and live happily ever after
wonderful cucumber yogurt_sauce and i_don't_know what_kind_of crack they_put into the_rice_pudding with slivered nuts but_it_was addictive
i_wanted to_take_the steam tray full_and run out_of_the door
good_service besides feeling rushed to_finish when_it hit three
and_we_will definitely_go here_again
i_got_the mixed_grill
the_lamb_and shrimp were overcooked_and dry
but everything_else_was very_good
the_fact_that there_are_no other good indian_restaurants_in henderson green valley makes this an easy choice to_return
the_service_was_very_good
the_prices_were fair
and_overall
the_food_was_delicious
seven days a_week
taj_palace has_a lunch_buffet_for
located_in_the the shopping_center on eastern and richmar
this_new indian_restaurant_is rich in decor_and cuisine
the hand painted tapestry style wall mural
lantern style light fixtures
and open lighting gives a bright look that most_indian_places lack
the_service_was the_best_i_have_had in_a_long_time
as we_sat ourselves
the_waiter came_over to_ask what_kind_of naan_we would_like and filled our_water_glasses
throughout_the_meal
our dirty plates never stayed on_the_table for more_than minutes
if even that long
water_glasses_were promptly refilled at_the half way mark as_well
the_food_was consistent
i_found that i_did_not hate anything
but the_tandoori_chicken_was dry
the_garlic_naan_is amazing
when brought out
it_was piping_hot_and topped with_a copious amount of_garlic
the_line had two_different kinds_of rice
basmati and_a vegetable_biryani
they_also_had somosas that were_tasty
the_saag
spinach
here was_delicious
but did_not_have the_paneer
handmade cheese
the_other non meat dish i_really_liked was the_veggies in_the yellow curry
for_those who love_their meat
do_not fret
because taj_palace offer some_dishes for_the carnivores as_well
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was creamy_and possessed a deep
rich flavor
the_goat_curry was_tender_and not gamey
do_not forget to_get_a bowl_of the_kheer
rice_pudding
before leaving
taj palace's version is not_too_sweet and_has cashews for_a_nice crunch
it was_the_perfect end to a_great_meal
i have_to_admit i_was hesitant to_try indian_food_with their bold spices_and rich flavors but_now i_could kick myself for waiting sooo long
this_is now my_second trip_to taj_palace for_their_lunch_buffet and_i'm in_love
all_their dishes_are rich in_flavor and_oh so_good
i_have_not tried any_other places_in_town so_i_have nothing_to compare_to but at_this rate who cares
i_love having them so_close to_my_house
my_first_visit there i fell in_love_with a carrot pudding with it's sweet texture_and shredded bits_of carrot
it_is perfection on_my spoon
so_i_was disappointed_that they_didn't_have it_out this_time when i_came_in since i_had_been craving_it for weeks
when the_waiter came_by to_see_how our_meals were i sadly told him how_much i loved_their carrot dish_and how_much i'd been craving_it
he smiled and_said yes it_is_good isn't it_and walked away
after devouring all_their other yummy vegetarian_dishes plus_the oh_so scrumptious
piping_hot naan_bread
i_almost choked back my_mouth of_food in surprise to_see_the waiter carrying out a_bowl full_of my carrot dish to_the_table
i_couldn't believe how awesome and_attentive he_was
that's what_i call service
d at_that point i_had already overeaten and_could not_take more_than bites so_i kindly asked_for_a take_home box ashamed to_waste such perfection
i'm glad my_taste_buds have finally matured to_try_the wonderful new cultural flavors i've introduced them too
lol
i_can't_wait_to_go_back and_i recommend_this_place_to everyone i_know
i_had high hopes taj_palace but should have_known that this_place_is destined to_be another flop in_the bucket of sub par indian_restaurants_in_las_vegas
my_family_and i had_dinner_here last_night
we_ordered several different naans
rotis
and kulchas
the naans_were undercooked and you_could pull at_the doughy centers
the rotis were_too thick_and you couldn't tell them apart from the_naan
we_ordered_chicken kadai and_butter_chicken
both_dishes are rich but_the oil floating on_top_of the_chicken kadai was_just gross
the_chicken pieces in_the murgh makani
butter_chicken
were strange bits with tiny bones
i_was_hoping for good_quality white chicken_breast
we also_ordered_a shrimp_dish but_all you_could taste_was the_tomato base
it lacked the_spicy kick we_were looking_forward_to
on_the_other_hand
the_servers_were very_polite_and friendly
the_ambiance could use improvement
i'm all_about energy efficient lighting
but_the white lights gave_the place_a cafeteria like feel
how_much longer do we have_to_wait before_we can_get the quality_indian_food of cities like chicago
ny and la
we_are so thrilled to_have excellent_indian_food so close_to_home
i_can't_believe we_didn't try_it sooner
we_loved the_menu with_all_the many_items not found in_every indian_restaurant
i_love hot
spicy vindaloo sauce
which was_cooked_to_perfection in_their lamb_vindaloo
my_husband_had_the lamb madras
not_quite so hot
also cooked_to_perfection
the accompaniments of basmati_rice_and naan_bread
along_with delicious mango_chutney and cool
refreshing cucumber raita more_than our expectations
the_service_was_great_and the_ambiance as_well
the_best_part was
we had_leftovers for_lunch_the_next_day
next we will_try their_lunch_buffet
we_will highly_recommend_it to_all lovers of_indian_cuisine as_well as novices who want to_try_something to really treat their palate
especially lovers of_spicy
hot_food
like myself
their offer of dine_in and carry_out
as_well as catering makes_it complete
excellent indian_restaurant
food_was_really_good
and so_was_the service_and atmosphere
i_love that you_could choose the_spicy level from to
i_mean it's indian_food_so that's a_major factor
i_went_with on_the spicy scale and_it_was deliciously spicy
i_highly_recommend trying this_place
i_was_really hesitant reviewing an_indian_restaurant
since living_in lv for_years i_had pretty much resigned myself to the_idea that indian_restaurants were_just mediocre
taj_palace completely changed my idea and_i_think it's_the_best place_for real
i
e
not covered_in oil and cream
indian_food
my_hubby and_i_have_been here_a_few_times
and even_brought other friends out_here who loved_it
firstly
the_food_is_really fresh which_is important
the pieces_of meat they_serve are_big cubes
the_flavors_are bold and remind me_of how my_family cooks
we've tried their_lunch_buffet which_has a_really big variety_of veg_and non_veg food
i_love that they_bring fresh_naan to_your_table
i_have_to_say that_we tried_their veg samosa_and it was_one_of_the_best we've ever_had
crispy on_the_outside and piping_hot on_the_inside
i_think_i even dreamed about_their mango_lassi
it's so_good
we've tried a_variety_of their chicken_dishes and_while they_do an_amazing murgh makani
butter_chicken
last_night we_tried their_chicken kadai
chicken_with green peppers_and onions
and my_hubby loved_it
i_was_craving aloo parantha
a bread stuffed with_potatoes and_peas
and_saag_paneer
spinach_and cheese cubes
and_it blew me_away
in_fact
the_food_is even_better the_next_day
the_service_is amazing
and_everyone is_really_nice
they remember us_from previous visits and_that makes_it more special when_we eat_there
unlike other_indian_restaurants where we've waited minutes_to even_get water
here they_serve you drinks immediately
also
i_would_give them an_extra star because_they_are one_of_the_few indian_places that serve ras malai which is_hands_down my_favorite dessert in the_world
and_it_was soft_and perfect and_delicious
i didn't_even share it
all in_all
we'll be regulars here for_a_long_time
great_service
very_flavorful
authentic
of_course
yummy dishes
huge_menu
i'll be trying the_lunch_buffet as_soon as_i'm in_that area_of town during noon
happy to_give taj five_stars
decided to_try_this_place due_to_a restaurant
com gift_certificate and_we_are completely glad_we did
we ordered_the_tandoori jhinga
shrimp
chicken_tikka_masala
one regular_naan
one garlic_naan
and a_mango_lassi
everything_was_great
chicken_tikka_masala_was spiced just_right
i_think_we could've handled a_bit_more spiciness
and_shrimp tandoori was_yummy
garlic_naan was_a_bit overcooked so we_ordered_a regular_naan
which was_just_right
the_restaurant_itself_is in_a great_location
spacious
with nice_ambience
overall
i'm glad there's an_indian_restaurant_in the silverado area definitely_worth_a repeat visit
best_curry i've_had_in_a really long time
i_actually had_a sit down dinner_here as i'm_not much_for buffets
it's a_little_pricey
but worth_every_penny
we_had_a tikka_masala
lamb rojan josh
and_the mattar_paneer
each_dish was_cooked_to_perfection and_had its own flavor profile
like_it's supposed_to
so_many curry_houses seem_to_have a one size fits all base sauce
which ruins the_food
thankfully
this_is_not_the case at taj
the_portions_were generous in_both size and_with meat content
though it_was_a_little at_the high end for_a curry_house
i_do feel as though_i got_my money's worth
they_are still waiting on_their booze license
so at this_time
no beer or wine yet
i_can't_wait_to_go_back and_try some_more of_their yummy curries
good_selection for_the_lunch_buffet
garlic_naan_was made_fresh and the_taste_was very_good
great_value for_lunch
a palace indeed
had_the pleasure of having_a late dinner_and had_my reservations as i_walked into_a nearly empty dining_room
our_waiter was_awesome_and was_extremely welcoming
not_too familiar_with this type_of cuisine so_i relied heavily on recommendations
unfortunately i_can't_remember what_i ordered
but_i do remember enjoying it thoroughly
i_even requested nd's to_take_home for_lunch_the_next_day
stop_by and_give it_a_go
was_a_little skeptical because my_family_and i_have_eaten_at quite a_few indian_restaurants_in_town and_there have only_been a_couple that_have passed the test
taj_palace is_definitely another_indian_restaurant that we_will_be frequenting in_las_vegas
this_place_just reopened with new_management and_is absolutely_amazing
the_owner_is very active and_makes sure you_are enjoying your_meal
the_food_was spiced great_and_the service_was_awesome
this_is_definitely a_place you_could get into_a habit of_going
we_will_be backs asap
it's_an ok
indian_restaurant
only reasons why its getting all_the positive_reviews is_because its the_only_one in henderson
specially on eastern
i_had their_lunch_buffet which_was so_so
curries_were cold_and sort of tasteless
they_were running low on food at_the_buffet and_the_rice_was abysmal
how do_you screw up rice
the_best_thing about_this_place_is their_garlic_naan
i_think its_the freshsest naan i_ever_had at a_buffet
there_are_better restaurants_in_vegas
if_you_want good_food
then go_to namaste or mint_indian_bistro
the_friendly wait_staff_is here_to please knowledgeable indian_food eaters
complex flavors on traditional_indian dishes will treat you right

cheers
last_night
in_his work induced coma on_his only night off in ages
my_husband mumbled something_about dinner
what are_you hungry for
what have we not eaten_in ages
and then_he answered his own question indian
i_remembered seeing positive_reviews of_a place_on eastern and found_it on_my yelp app
so off we_went
we entered with a_bit_of hesitation as the_restaurant_was empty with the_exception of_two diners
after waiting_for what seemed forever
he acknowledged us_and invited us to_be_seated
i recognized him
but couldn't place his face
maybe it_was because_he handed us menus while talking on_a cordless phone and giving the_other customers their check
multi tasking
not_good for_an initial restaurant impression
the_husband began_to eyeroll me
but_he became more forgiving as the_server helped him through_the enormous menu and_we
as_usual
overordered
vegetable_samosas
chili pakoras
tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
mango_chicken
shrimp tikka
dal
saag with_potatoes
zeera rice
raita
chili garlic_naan
not_to_mention the complimentary pappadums and_chutneys and chilis
stop it
yes
enough_food for_days
my concerns that this_would_be steam table fare were put to rest once things began_to arrive on_the_table
favorite_dishes
the_vegetable samosas_were incredibly flavorful_and delicious
mango_chicken
even better_than_the tikka
the_two vegetable_dishes
yellow lentils_and the_spinach were_very satisfying
the_rice simple_and delicious
and_the_garlic chili naan_was spectacular
particularly with the_raita
all in_all a_very_good meal
oh
and_the_server
it's jignesh
the former manager server of sai india curry our_favorite little chaat house near unlv that zipped up unceremoniously a_while back
beer
domestic only_for now
and_wine available
it's a_simple
lovely space with good_food_and kind service
and_the_owner is_definitely yelp savvy he encouraged us_a to_write a_yelp review as_he bid us adieu
lunch_buffet_is great the_only_thing_that would_make it perfect is if they_served aloo_gobi
chutneys are fresh_and_delicious
haven't been there_for_dinner yet
but_we definitely_will
staff_is_super nice
service_is_excellent
great_location
we_used to_love india_palace
but hated to_have_to drive into_the hood
if_you_like_indian_food
you'll love_this_place
this recently opened indian_restaurant was_not_very busy on_the monday evening of our_visit
we recived complimentary papadum with_a spicy mint sauce_and the_worst tamarind_sauce i_have_ever encountered
our_entrees were boti kabob masala
lamb chunks in a_rich yellow curry
and murgh madras
boneless chicken_in a_tomato cream curry
in_addition
we_ordered naan_and zeera rice
lightly spiced basmati_rice with cumin seeds
neither entr_e scaled any culinary heights though the_amount_of animal protein in each would likely have caused hannibal lechter to rejoice
i_felt menu prices
separate charge for plain_rice
were_on the_high side
do_i like_indian_food
yes
i_like lots_of flavor
being from louisiana
i_have_had indian_food_with some_indian friends of_mine and_i didn't_have_the heart to_tell them they can't cook because_i thought that's_what indian_food must_be like
taj_palace had_all the_flavor i craved in every_dish i_ate
lamb_samosa
goat_curry
lamb kadai
too good
and_the dish_that stood out_as interesting_and fun was mango_chicken curry
i_will_be ordering that_one again
taj_palace is_located_in an upscale strip_mall and had_been one_of_our go_to places for_indian_food
their_lunch_buffet_is
and one_of_the_better values in_town
their space has_a bright_and comfortable ambience
they_offer_a wide_selection_of vegetarian and_meat_dishes
some_of which_you don't typically see at other_indian_buffets
i_do wish they_offered butter_chicken instead_of chicken_tikka_masala because dark meat_is more tender_and tasty than white_meat
they_also include unlimited
fresh baked plain or garlic_naan_with your lunch
for_dessert
they_usually offer kheer
rice_pudding
and_sometimes they_also have halva
actually
this_is the_first_place i ever_tried halva
and_it_was_delicious
service_is_friendly_and generally efficient
on_our last_visit
i_was_disappointed by how_they handled an incident where_i discovered that_i_was chewing on a_small strip of plastic imbedded in_their curry
the_staff initially denied it_was plastic and said_it_was vegetable fiber
once it became evident that_it_was indeed a_piece_of plastic
he said omg
grabbed it_and ran back into the_kitchen
they_never apologized or offered_us any dispensation
nor did we ask for_any
my_husband and_i_went_to taj place
the_food_was_good_and tasty
the_service_was_good
we_really like_it
just noticed a picture of iron mike tyson posing with the_owner
so apparently this must_be a local favorite of_his
i_came_here awhile back for_the_lunch_buffet_and while the_selection_was fairly extensive
the single item that beckoned me to_return was their_garlic_naan
served piping_hot straight from the_tandoori oven
the aroma is ethereal and_it is_one_of_the_best i_have_ever_had
if you_wait too_long
the soft pillowy texture transforms into_a stale saltine cracker like consistency so please don't hold anything back_and just attack that naan like tyson on holyfield's ear
i_try to_rate indian_restaurants on_their regular_menu rather than buffet since_there can often be_a steep drop off in quality_of_food although their_buffet_is somewhere between stars
on_my return_visit with_a_friend for_dinner
we_ordered_the goat vindaloo_and_the malai_kofta
vegetable balls served_in_a heavy cream_sauce loaded with_spices such_as cumin
coriander
and chili
and_a_side_of the_chili garlic_naan
the_server will ask you to_give a_number from regarding spice_level
we chose for_the vindaloo_and for_our vegetarian entry
combined with the_chili garlic_naan
our tastebuds were_on overdrive for_most of_the_meal and_in retrospect
i_think the_garlic_naan_is perfect on_its own minus the chilis and_is plenty of_spice to perk up the_flavors without constantly reaching for_water
the_goat in_the tangy and_hot vindaloo sauce_was amazingly tender_and very_flavorful_and was accompanied by some_nice hunks of_potato
i_actually didn't mind the_fact_that some_of_the pieces were_still attached to bone since those were_some of_the_best parts
the_malai_kofta balls were savory with the_vegetable component
slightly sweet in part due_to some raisins within_the mixture
and_the complex sauce_was both creamy_and spicy providing a_beautiful spectrum of_flavors
throw in_the beautiful interior
nice choice in silverware and plating
and_the excellent_service
this_is_a_great option_for those venturing out_to henderson in_the_mood for_something off_the beaten path
do take advantage_of the off dinner coupon_for checking_in on_yelp_and do_not leave without partaking in the_garlic_naan
i_really_enjoy this_place
its very close_to_my boyfriends house so we_always come_here
the_chicken_tikka_masala is_very_good
and the_goat_curry is_great
the_servers_are very_friendly_and treat customers very_well
it_is worth_trying
update
their_lunch_buffet has_been getting better and_better by the_day
we_have_been going_here since they_opened
amazing_food
generous buffet from salad to vegetarian to chick goat dishes
they_also serve free naan_with buffet you_can even_get garlic_naan
fresh out_of_the oven
the_service_is_always great
we_never have_to_ask for_a water or drinks
plenty of parking too
mom got a_coupon on_the mail and_decided_to give this_restaurant a_try
we_went_in there with_no expectations
the_service_was fantastic
everyone_was warm and_attentive
i_ordered chicken_tandoori and mom got peas_and potatoes_in cream_sauce
we_ordered naan_and_rice
we_also_had delicious vegetarian zomosas
the_food_took a_while which told_us it_was being cooked when_we_ordered and_not sitting_in a warmer
everything_was_delicious
we_are definitely going_back_for buffet
the_restaurant_is beautiful
good job taj_palace
this_place_is_great
i_had their_lunch_buffet and_i_went home fully satisfied
we_ordered garlic_naan
and_got food_from the_buffet_line
chicken_tikka_masala was_really_good
it was_tender_and the_sauce_was delicious
my_favorite way to_eat naan_is to_dip it_in curry or dipping it_in one_of_the_dishes
i devoured three baskets of_garlic_naan in no_time
their curry was_excellent as_well
great_place_to satisfy your_indian appetite
im getting hungry just talking about_this_place
my_wife_and_i took her brother and_his wife to_this fine indian_restaurant late on_a_friday_night
luckily they_are_open until
pm
it_was the_first_time_we visited_this fairly new_restaurant
since_my wife's family has_never had_indian_food_before
i_wanted them to_try_some of_the_more tasty
but safe for beginners indian_dishes which_i will discuss in a_minute
we_were_greeted and_seated quickly by warm_and_friendly people
before we_placed our_order i_asked_for some papad to munch on
they_brought_out several pieces with_two different_types_of sauces chutneys that were_just delicious
as_an_appetizer we_ordered four vegetable_samosas that_were the_best_i've_ever_had
i_thought i_would_go out_on_a limb and ask_for one_of_my_favorite_indian dishes
that is_always off menu the ultra delicious_and elusive chicken
our_waiter said_that he_would ask the_chef
to_my_surprise
he returned with_a yes
however
the_chef needs a_day in_advance to prepare it
definitely returning soon just for_that dish alone
in lieu of_chicken
the_chef recommended chicken kadai
which turned_out_to be excellent
on_a heat scale_of
i_ordered an and it_was_perfect
it_was flavorful_and saucy
in_addition
for_our main_courses we_ordered indian_food staples such_as biryani
chana_masala
and_tandoori_chicken
biryani can_be difficult_to make correctly especially_if_you have_eaten a_lot homemade biryani
it was_the_perfect complement to the_other_dishes
the_portion_was ideal since_we_were all sharing
the_chana_masala very_tasty
the garbanzos were cooked_perfectly and over_all was_very_good
we_ordered_a whole tandoori_chicken which_is enough_for four people
it_was brought to_us on_a sizzling platter
it_was moist_and scrumptious
we_opted_for orders_of naan garlic
garlic chili
and_plain
perfectly seasoned_and made_fresh
you just_can't eat_indian_food without naan
i_highly_recommend_the taj mango shake
they_are_so good
you_will need your_own because_you won't want to_share it
one sip and you're hooked
have_it with_your_meal or as_a dessert
either way
it's_a must_have beverage
i_can tell you_that i_have_no need_to_go anywhere else for_indian_food
this_is it for_me
anywhere else would only be_a gamble
i will_be_returning to_try other_dishes and_of_course i_will call ahead to_try_their chicken
since everything_else_was so_good
i_know that_i won't_be_disappointed
dont know what_the hype is_about
nothing_special have_had alot better_indian_food
dry chicken_tika
rice tasted like_it_was a_day old
best part_was the_naan_bread and_the cute waiter
close_to_my house
i_think_i found a_new spot_for my_indian_food pleasure
i_had samosa
korma_and naan
yummy
i_love_the blend_of_spices in_my korma
the somosa was the_biggest i've seen
this_is_a_must return place
oh_and a bonus
they_have goat
great_buffet
this_is_a vegetarian's haven
i_took_my vegetarian daughter here and_everything_was absolutely_delicious
we_both_had the_buffet which_came_with made_to_order garlic
you_can_order it regular too
naan_bread
i_love spicy_food and_this_place satisfies that craving
i've_been_to many indians restaurants_in southern nevada and california and_i_must_say this_place_is in the_top three
i_ordered_the lamb_vindaloo to_go at_an heat_level
i_was warned by owner bobby that it_would_be very_hot and_i said i_could handle it
i_must_say he_was right
it_was_a lively treat to_the taste_buds but_it required some labor to_get_the heat down
next_time_i_will get_it at level
i_was_very_impressed by_the portion of_the_dish
in my_experience indian_restaurants_are usually chintzy with meat portions
taj_palace is very_generous with_their fare
i_will_be a frequent patron
great_food
i_really loved_their curry_chicken and tikki chicken_masala and_the fresh_naan they_serve to_you in the_beginning
soo good_and soo fresh
i_went_to their_lunch_buffet for_the_first_time yesterday
a_lot_of selection to_choose_from_and it_is all_very worth_the_price
i_brought my sleeping mos
year old along_with me
i had_no_idea she was_going_to wake up so suddenly and_was crying the_moment i would_get up_and get myself a_fresh new plate_of food
the very_nice gentleman waiter that_was there_was so kind to go_out_of his way to_help cheer my_daughter up when_she would cry
she_was in_all smiles afterwards
great_place
ambience
music
service
and_definitely delicious_food
i_am_going back again very_soon
thank_you again_to the_nice gentlemen waiter_for making my_daughter and i's first_time experience at_the_restaurant so wonderful
really great_food flavor
spice
everything
at_first i_was unsure about the_price
but the_value is_great
a_ton_of_food
enough to_share and_for leftovers
everyone that worked there was_so_nice and_courteous
we'll definitely be_back
we_were so_happy to_find_this restaurant
there_is_a pride of ownership here
and_the_food_is made_with love
the food_is_so_good
and_they_offer more nan
refill your glass_of_water
are_always polite_and welcoming
the_best_thing is the_tikka massala
it_is_not the watered_down stuff like_the mint_indian_bistro
although_we like to_go_there too sometimes
the_food_here_is serious and if_you_like it_spicy
you_got it
lunch_buffet_is
and worth_every_penny
just take a_small sample of_everything on_the_buffet_line
and_you_will leave with a_smile
one_time they_had samosas
and_they_were also_great
they_don't always_have that though
enjoy
don't_forget_to leave a_little tip ha ha
great_lunch_buffet
beautiful and_relaxing setting
nice waiters
friendly
with good_service
great_service_and great_food
loved_it
as a_long_time orange county kid and_the son of_indian immigrants
i_have_a pretty_good understanding of_quality south_asian cuisine
i've_eaten a_lot_of it_from restaurants_and i've_had it countless times_in home_cooked meals
trust_me then
when_i say_that this_place_is really just_ok
it's well_decorated
and_the_service_was alright
we_came_here for_a_lunch_buffet one_time
i_did find the_garlic_naan to_be pretty_tasty
but in_the realm of_indian_cuisine
this establishment hardly impresses
its hard for_me_to put into words exactly
but the_flavor
texture
and_quality_of the_ingredients were simply below what_i expect_from an_indian_place
some_of_the curries were_a_bit bland
i_wasn't particularly impressed_by their_chicken_tikka
the_lentils here_are are_a_bit overcooked
and_again
just_not that_good
don't_get_me_wrong its passable and worth_trying
i_think its a_good_place_to go_to for_lunch indian_food isn't something most_people eat everyday
but if_you_want quality south_asian food
there_are much better_places
even here_in_vegas
try_the hole in_the_wall kabob corner in fremont
it may_not look impressive but_their food_tastes much fresher and is_much better seasoned
my_husband_and_i stopped here_for_lunch and it_was_fantastic
we_are normally a_little skeptical of_buffets but_the_food_was all_very fresh_and_hot
plus there_was a_lot_of selection
the_place has_a nice_decor and_a_nice smell aside from the_food
there_was_an underlying spicy incense smell
the_price_was just_a_little higher than the_standard lunch_buffet but_it_was definitely worth_it due_to higher quality
the_service_was_good
our water_glasses_were never empty and_the_server checked_on us repeatedly to_make_sure everything_was to_our liking
i_would_definitely_recommend
food_was_good
its close_to_my house and_i_had_a groupon so decided_to try since i_love_indian_food
service_was_good
saw_that they_offer_a lunch_buffet so may_have to_come_back_and try sometime
was_looking_for an_indian_restaurant for_dinner in_the henderson area
and taj_palace has
so_i figured why_not
i_had_the chicken_tikki_masala
and my_date had the_paneer tikkia masala
we_also_had_a side_of_rice and_an indian_beer
even_with the_yelp discount
the_bill came_out_to after tax
while the_food_was definitely good
as_was_the service
that_just seems_like a_lot_of money for_what_we ordered
every other_indian_restaurant i've_been_to_in town is cheaper
and even_more so when_i use a_restaurant
com certificate
love_the_food
recommend chicken_tika_masala
you can't_go_wrong_with this_one in any_indian_restaurant
want_to try lunch_buffet sometime
being such_an unoriginal foodie i_have_been working on branching out_to different_types_of cuisine
indian_food was_on_the must_try list for_me
admittedly my very first indian_food dining_experience was some_time last year and_i failed to_yelp about_it insert hand slap here
but_that only means i will_have_to revisit the eatery
drumming up repeat business
and yelp about_it then
back_to taj_palace
yum
last_night was my_second time dining here and_it_was equally as delightful as the_first_time
excellent_service
not a_glass gone empty all night
food seasoned to_perfection and plenty of left_overs to_enjoy today
my_only gripe menu item gripes were regarding the_appetizers
paneer_pakora and the_fish pakora
both were_extremely dry_and virtually flavorless
all in_all
stellar service
the_place_is rarely packed
delicious eats
if you steer clear of_the fried appetizers
distinguishable meats
white_meat chicken used
yey
and_delicious flavors will_have me_and_my friends coming_back_for more
this was_my_first foray into indian_food_and i_found_it using yelp
the_staff_was friendly_and_helpful
explaining what each_item was on_the_buffet
i_tried_a taste_of everything and_found the_chicken_tikka_masala_and chicken_tandoori amazing
i scooped it up_with delicious garlic_naan
i_usually love curry
but didn't_care_for the_goat_curry
nor did_i like the_vegetarian_dishes with spinich or lentils
i chk'd the_menu prices as_well_and the_buffet_is an_excellent deal
i'll be_going back_there soon
our fave place
service superb
food delicious
reasonable_price
deliciousness
great_food
i_love_the chef
he's awesome
delicious
got_the_chicken saag_and paneer_masala
great portions for decent prices
each
very_friendly_and_attentive staff
they check the_spice_level with_the appetizer chutney so you_know_what you're getting
will_be coming back_on my_next trip_to_vegas
i like_indian_food on_the spicier side
and_they got_it just_right
their saag has_a pasty
airy texture
overall
quality buffet
place_was soo yummy
went_with_a party_of people and_we_all ordered something different_and shared and we_liked everything
not the_worst indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
but absolutely not deserving of_a
yelp rating
when we_visited the_buffet_was uninspired
featured no paneer option
and_was severely lacking_in spice_and overall layers of_flavour
it_felt geared toward middle america's palate rather than those_of expats from_the sub continent and those_of us_with a_bit_of experience in_the true heavenly flavours of_the region
give_me a_good curry and_some tasty naan_to mop up the_sauce and_i_am happy
sadly
taj_palace presented my_usual go_to dish
the_chicken_tikka_masala
as_a disappointinging bland
rather sweet
and lacking any real zest and_the_naan_was almost tasteless
the_food looked ok
but this_is_the sort of_indian a grandparent would eat
i'll stick_to mint or mt_everest
i_dont go anywhere else for indian_food_in_vegas after finding this_place
staff_is very_attentive_and polite which_is_nice
sometimes i go_in on_a slow night with_my year old for mommy son dinner dates and the_place_is empty so i_dont feel like he_is bothering anyone
plates are def big enough_for
decor inside_is beautiful
date worthy
i_always_get_the murgh madras combo
i_have_had it_spicy and_non spicy by accident when_they forgot_to ask
i have_to_admit spice_is key when_it_comes_to flavor here_but the_meat is_always very well_cooked
must go spicy
i_ate at_this_place about two years_ago with_a_friend who_was a_curry fiend
i_remembered the_meal i_had_was pretty_good
so when_we_got some coupons in_the mail the_wife and_i_decided_to go_again
i'm_in no_way or form an_expert_on_indian food_as i've_always enjoyed_the east asian curries more
so_the wife_and_i played it safe and went_with_a full order_of tandoori murgh shahnaz
marinated baked chicken on_the bone
and jhinga tikka_masala
prawns with onion_and peppers in_a tomato cream_sauce
on_the side was garlic_naan_and white_rice
the_chicken
being thighs and legs
was_as_good as i_remembered
served a sizzling cast iron plate on_a bed_of onions_and peppers
they managed_to render out most_of_the fat while cooking
thanks_to the clay_oven
but managed_to keep all_of_the flavor
the prawn dish was_delicious
but_for i_would_expect more prawns or_at least bigger ones
the_highlight_of the_dish_was the_tomato cream_sauce that found it's way on_top_of my_chicken rapped in naan
the service_was_quick
attentive
and funny
when_i ordered both dished with_the rice naan combo add on for the_waiter suggested just_a double order_of_naan and a_single order_of rice
that kind of customer_service_is very highly appreciated
when it_came time to_go we_had_some left_overs that definitely earned a_trip home with_us
i_appreciate it_when a_restaurant gives you decent to_go containers and these_guys didn't attempt to_have us shove everything_in one big styrofoam container but gave us smaller ones for each component of_the_meal
perhaps a silly thing_to comment on
but i_like_it when_my left_overs look just as_good_as_the day i_ordered them
is_this an
authentic_indian
restaurant
damned if_i know
but_since the_staff_is indian and_very_friendly i imagine if you flexed your knowledge they'll be accommodating
a narrow menu selection
but good_quality
i_only recently realized that they_charge for_rice
at_dinner
which i_thought strange
as badly as i_want_to try_new indian_restaurants_in_town
i_always end_up leaving utterly disappointed and regretting my decision for_not just going to_mint
my never fails me staple
taj_palace was no_exception
things had started_off well with_a_nice interior and_friendly_service
but_then everything started to_go downhill from there_with a_total blowup to_end our_meal
food_took much too_long to_come_out
free papadums were_nice
but the_tamarind and_mint chutneys tasted old
the_garlic_naan had_no traceable amounts of_garlic
plus it_was super crunchy and_almost burnt
for a_bowl_of plain_rice
the_aloo_gobi
or gobi aloo as_they call it
was_completely flavorless
at_an_indian_restaurant
it_was_just boiled potatoes
cauliflower
and tomatoes sitting_in some liquid
not edible
i will_give credit where credit is due and say_that_the paneer tiki_masala was_very_good
it_was flavorful and_had_a generous portion_of paneer
the kicker was at_the_end when_we_went to_pay_for our_meal and we_were_told they wouldn't accept our coupon
it would_have_been one_thing if_there_was a_sign posted on the_door stating this or_if we_hadn't shown the_servers the_coupon until the_end_of our_meal
however
there_is no sign saying they_don't accept coupons and_we_had the_coupon out at_the edge of the_table from_the minute we_sat_down
four servers never once said anything about_it before we_ordered
despite the_fact_that i_saw all of_them look_at it
i'm tired of restaurants offering coupons and_then deciding they don't_feel like_it anymore and won't make good on the_ones that are_still out_there
but to_wait until after we_are done eating to_tell us
when_you know_that we_have_a coupon waiting
is shady to_me
it's times like these i_wish my_mom didn't raise me to_be polite_and just walk away_from_the situation
the_paneer_was their saving grace that brought them up_to two_stars
just_went here_for_the_first_time earlier this evening
based on yelp_reviews
excellent food_and_service
staff_was_very attentive_and_friendly
food_was_awesome
i_was_in_the east side_of_the town_and trying to_find_a indian_restaurant_that closer_to me to_get_the lunch
i_was looking_at_the yelp_and tried_this_place for_the comments they_had
i_was_happy with_their interior decoration and_the_guy who_was water is_kind and_pleasant to_make_the place likable
food_is little spicier and_its perfect to_my taste_and thandor chicken_was over painted with the_red color
i_think_they use lots_of food colors and_they might_have to reduce that to_make people less curiosity
mango_lassi_was perfect_and dosa taste was_great
i_will definetley go_back_and will recommend to_anyone
great indian_buffet
they_have_a_great selection for_vegetarians
such_as myself
and_also some meat_dishes for_those who choose to_eat meat
vick is_a_great server
he_will take_care of_you asap
check_it_out
the_good
of_all_the indian_restaurants_in_town
taj_palace is_one_of_the_best
their dinner_menu is_so distinctive and_it stands out of_all_the menus in_town
their_food_is rich in_flavor
content
and_taste
this might be sneaky
but i_got_a good look_at their kitchen when_i_was walking to_use washroom their kitchen_is huge_and from_all that_i've seen
it_is spotless clean
that showed in the_quality_of their_food and_its taste
service_was_good
the_bad
nothing
nada
if you insist
i_still don't_have anything
bottom_line
if_you_live in_las_vegas_and you_are craving_indian
this_is_the_place i_recommend you_go
i_will_go_back there soon to_try_out their_lunch_buffet
we_were craving_indian_food but didn't_feel like driving so we_stopped by this_place
we_had their_lunch_buffet before_but wasn't overly impressed
we figured the_dinner would_be better
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala with spiciness out_of and_it_was_pretty hot
they_used white_meat but some pieces were very_dry and_some were moist
she ordered a_combination plate
coming_from ny and boston indian_food always comes with_rice but they_charge you here
we also_ordered_a nan_and roti which was_pretty_good
this_place wasn't horrible but_i probably won't go_back_to this_location and would_probably drive a_little further for better_indian_food
just short and_sweet to_let others know
this_place_is wonderful in_every way
best indian_food_i_have_ever_had and_best service_and low prices
best_of all
they_do_not have_a liquor licence but encourage you_to bring_your_own wine or beer_and they_will open for_you
no charge
i_had wanted_to_go to_this_place for_a_long_time because my_husband_and_i are vegan
and my_daughter and hter boyfriend eat every kind of_food out_there
so we_finally went all together and it_was_awesome
the_flavors_were out_of_this_world
we could_not stop_eating
the_service_was wonderful_and the_servers_were kind_and funny
we_had all vegetable_dishes and the_kids had fish_and lamb
the_dining_area was lavishly decorated and could_be a_very romantic dinner spot
the_only suggestion i_could make was_to turn the air conditioning up
especially_with all_of_the spicy_food
let me be straight
i_love_indian_food
what's better_than sopping up all_that extra sauce_with tender naan_bread
you_really can't_go_wrong
we haven't_had the pleasure of_a indian_restaurant close_to_home
so_when a_friend_of our invited us_to taj_palace for_dinner it_was_a no brainer
the_decor_is subtly lit
and classic indian culture
pretty much what i_would_expect walking_into an_indian_restaurant
i_was_quite excited to_see_the discount for check_in on_yelp
the screams
smart
business to_me
our server's name was vick and_he_was a class act
he_made some_really amazing recommendations
the_most unexpected and easily most refreshing was_a yogurt based mango drink
non alcoholic
if_you_don't do alcohol this_is_a_must
it_was subtly sweet
enchancing the earthy flavor_of_the mango while wrapping you_up in_all that yogurt creaminess
i_don't_even like mango and_i_was in_love
the wine_list was_pretty limited
but i_can't_say i_was_expecting a cellar list to_be presented
the pinot noir i_ordered was pleasing
but pinot's a typically easy drinking wines
we_started with_a lamb_samosa chili paneer
both_were presented quickly
and were_delicious
i_wish that_i_could remember
pronounce or_even spell some_of_the indian names of_the_dishes we_ate
but alas
i_cannot
i_know
lame
i_had_the non_veg combo platter
it included chicken_tikka_masala butter_chicken chicken_curry dal riata naan rice rice_pudding
i_went_with_a level on my_food
i_like_the spice
but want_to taste the_flavor
my_husband tried_the shrimp_curry at a_level
the_butter_chicken at taj_palace is_nothing short_of incredible
don't_get_me_wrong
everything_was_delicious
and_i_have few complaints
as_i write this_review however
my palette is overcome with_the savory lingering of the_butter_chicken sauce
yum
vick
our_server
actually_had the_chef make_me an_additional portion to_take_home for naan dipping
what an_awesome guy
he's an_a in_my_book
my husband's dish_was spicy
and rightfully so it_was_a
the_shrimp was_perfectly cooked_and saucy
my_only complaint_was that his garlic_naan_was quite burnt around_the edges
this was_disappointing
as_i_had read many reviews about_how great the_garlic_naan_was
oh_well
maybe next_time
and_that's where i'll leave you my yelp friends
there will indeed be_a next_time
taj_palace was_delicious
the_atmosphere_was comfortable and classy
the_service_was on_point and_attentive
give taj_palace a_try
your tummy will thank_you
i_took_my dad here_for an_early father's day lunch
the friday before father's day
bad choice when your father is_indian
the_ambiance and_decor was_very_nice
and the_service_was_good
considering how_busy they_were
now on to_the good_stuff
well the not_so good_stuff in_this case
the_food
we frequented the_restaurant during_the afternoon
during_the_lunch_buffet
i was_excited_to_try somewhere new_and the_reviews about_this_place were_great
as_soon_as_i approached the_buffet
i_could see_that the_vegetables were soaked in oil
i_was mortified
i'm_not the healthiest person
but i_could_not knowingly eat such oily indian_food
especially when_i cook_it myself_and i_know_it does not require that_much oil
my_dad had_the_buffet
and_was_not very_pleased
i_ordered malai_kofta_and dal_makhani off of_the_menu
the_malai_kofta was_not_good
i_took it home_and threw it away
and_i_was raised to never waste food
the_naan_was ok
nothing_to_write_home about
the plus side to_this adventure was_the dal_makhani
it was_really_tasty
most indian_restaurants_in_vegas are_not cheap
and_this_place_is no_exception
i_don't mind paying_for quality when_i receive it
but i_did_not receive it_here
i_will_not_be back
my hibernation from yelp ends with_this review_for taj_palace
i've_been_to taj on several occasions and have_always received perfect service
i seriously think that_they_have the_best_naan here in_town
everything else_is debatable
but for_some_reason their_naan takes the cake in my_eyes
of_course
indian_food_is always amazin for vegetarian_options which_is_what keeps me coming back
when_i asked_for_a on_the spicy scale
it_was exactly_what_i was asking_for
everytime
they question whether i truly wish to receive a
i_always assure them that_i'm thai and_can handle the_heat
usually that's enough anecdotal evidence to prove that i_am_a true chili head
i_believe i_ordered_the tikka_masala this time_around and_i_really have no_complaints
for_the drink
i_got_the mango yogurt drink
can't remember the_exact name
for_dessert
rice_pudding
the_server highly_recommended that_i_have the ice_cream in place of_it because_he thought_it_was way_better
i declined only because_it_was freezing cold in_this_place
otherwise
i_would_have taken up his offer
since this_place_is conveniently located next to_my_house
i_will_be here more often when_i'm craving delicious naan
we_decided_to_try this_place for_the_lunch_buffet
and_it_was alright for
before tax and gratuity
we_opted_for the_garlic_naan and_it_was_delicious
my_favorite_dish of_all time_at indian_buffet is the_goat_curry
there_was goat_curry on the_line
however
it_wasn't flavorful as i_would_have_liked it_to_be
thank goodness they_were tender
the_chicken_tandoori was_kind_of dry
the_kheer
which_is_the rice_pudding
wasn't_so delicious_as the_one over at_india_palace
i_have_to_say that i_enjoy the_lunch_buffet at_india_palace much_more
i_probably won't be coming_back_to taj
i_have now eaten here_several_times and_each_time the_food_is gotten better
the_manager was very_polite_and willing to_take advice regarding the_food_and seems_to have_taken some_of_my suggestions to heart and continues to_make_the quality better
the cleanliness of_the_restaurant is_excellent
the_buffet_is a_great_value and very_well done
i_would_highly_recommend this indian_food_restaurant to_anyone near_the area
peter
i've been_coming here_since this_place_was called taza
then jai ho
and_now taj_palace
i'm not_sure why the_name changes but either way the_food_is_always good
i by no means am an_indian_food expert but_my experiences here_are always_good
the_curries_are as spicy_as you_want them
the_nan is_delicious
i_love_the garlic_nan
and the_tandoori_chicken is_always piping_hot_and tasty
if_you're_not familiar_with_indian_food or really hungry
be_sure_to hit up their_lunch_buffet
there_are a_lot_of choices at_a_very reasonable_price
the_servers_are also very_helpful as_i try_to order_something new on each visit
also
be_sure_to keep an eye out_in local publications for coupons and specials
wow
my_daughter and_i_were visiting from san diego a_couple_of_weeks ago_and used yelp to locate a_good_indian_restaurant
we_were_not_disappointed
and_the_service_was_great thanks vic
all_i_can say_is yum yum_yum
this_place_was okay
my fiance and_i_were seriously craving_indian_food
and this_place_was near our house
the_portions_are good
you_get_a good_amount of_food_for what_you_pay for
we_shared_the chicken_tikka_masala
it_looked yummy
the_first bite was_really_good
but_as i_kept eating i_noticed some pieces_of_chicken tasted old
the_naan_was_good but nothing_special
honestly
i_would_not return here_again
i've had_better_indian_food for cheaper
been_wanting_to try taj_palace for_a_while since_it's the_closest indian_restaurant to_my_house and_i'm obsessed with_both samosa_factory and mt_everest from_my work lunch breaks
even_though_it averages stars here on_yelp
there_was always something_about the_reviews that made_me a_little tentative
well
that_and the_non buffet prices
what_is it about indian_restaurants_and their_dinner prices
they_always seem about more expensive per entree than i_expect
compared_to most_of_their lunch_buffet or lunch_special bargains
it drives me a_little crazy to_go_to one for_dinner_and get much less food_for a_lot_more money
this type_of thinking is_why my pants i_just picked up_from men's wearhouse barely fit
but_i digress
i_ordered_the veggie_samosas which is_one_of_my standards i judge any_indian_restaurant on
some plain_naan
and goat_curry spicy out_of
love_this scale
i_asked_if the_curry came with_rice
and i_was_told no
but that_i_could do_a combo of rice_and_naan
sure
sounds like exactly_what_i need
when_i_arrived
my total bill_was
now the_curry_was and the_samosas_were
according_to their_website
so_i_guess the naan_and_rice cost or_so
shrug
started_with_the curry over_the rice first
the_curry had_a_nice flavor
it_was thick
smoky
and the_spice_level was_perfect
on_top_of the rice_or being sopped up_with_the naan
the_naan_was about_what i_expect
which_is a_good_thing
either way made_me happy
the_goat was_tasty
but_there_were a_lot_of bones and pieces_of fat and cartilage throughout which_was a_bit_of_a buzzkill
it_was rare to_be_able_to get a_bite of_meat without having_to constantly spit out a_small chunk of_something
best visual ever
i_know
i_actually would_have ultimately preferred it with_just_the curry_sauce by_the_end_of my_plate
the_samosas_were very large_and perfectly shaped with_a_great flaky crust
honestly it_almost seemed_a_little too perfectly made which_had me wondering if_it_was homemade or_not
i_have_no way_of knowing honestly
it's_quite possible it_is
they tasted fine on_the_inside
but_i_found the_outside to_be overly salt or peppered or both
i'd honestly never_had_a samosa with so_much seasoning on_the_outside of_it
and_my fingers were covered_in spice whenever i'd pick_it up to_eat_it which_i wasn't used_to
the_green sauce it_came_with was_good
wasn't so_much a_fan_of the_red
overall a_good version
though_i prefer factory's or mt everest's
final conclusion is_that_i enjoyed my_meal overall
though i_wouldn't exactly say_it_was worth_the_price i_paid in total
i_did get leftovers out_of it which softened the blow a_little
i_think_i'll stick_with samosa_factory and mt_everest to_satisfy my_indian cravings
though if_i'm ever in_a dire need for_some curry_in henderson
it happens
it_definitely happens
taj_palace warrants some consideration
my_husband i_enjoyed dinner_at taj_palace on_a monday night
the service_was_prompt the_food_was_excellent
some_of_the best_food we've had_in_vegas actually
the prices_are_very fair considering how rich in_flavor all_the_dishes are
the_garlic_naan is_to_die_for as_well_as_the coconut_chicken curry
yumm
this_place_will be visited again very_soon
pretty solid indian_food definitely_the_best place_on this_side_of_town
definitely worth_trying
as far_as indian_food goes
taj_palace is_delicious
as far_as service
our_waiter vimal treated us like queens
it's the_typical strip_mall exterior
like almost_all restaurants_in henderson
nv
coming_from los angeles
i'm starting to_get used_to great restaurants like_this after_all
many wonderful treasures can_be found_in strip_mall style buildings in la
when we_were_seated around
pm
the_entire restaurant was_empty
so_there was_no wait
vimal brought out papadum
indian bread
crispy_and very thin like_a cracker
with hot green sauce_and a_tasty plum sauce
we_ordered veggie_samosas to_start
which seemed_to be hand made at_the_restaurant and_were spectacular
vimal convinced us to_try nasi biryani rice instead_of the_traditional white basmati_rice i_normally order
it's like_an_indian fried_rice
with golden raisins_and almonds that_has a yellow coloring from the_spices
delicious
that_came out with_our chicken_tikka_masala in medium spiciness and_our garlic_naan
every_dish was_better_than the_last
at_this_point a middle aged couple came into_the nicely_decorated restaurant and_sat down_to dinner as_well
i_think_it's surprising that the_place_was so empty
considering how yummy everything_was
the_other couple verbally recognized this and_asked vimal about_it as_well
it_seems new ownership took_over more_than a_year_ago
and he_just needs to_get_the word out
so here's the_word we'll be stopping by again soon to_check_out_the buffet_for_lunch
that seems_like a_great_value
we_love coming_here
we uaually come at least time per month
the_staff_is always friendly
the_place_is very_clean
and_the_food_is spicey
we_love_the garlic_naan_and the_tikka_masala
we_have_tried all_the_indian_restaurants in_the vegas_area
and none come close
price_is about
and worth_every_penny
i_really_like_the garlic_nan
we_actually ate_at the_lunch_buffet
which_is definately worth_the_price
i_couldn't tell you what_to_order but_we_had some_kind_of mixed_vegetable dish_that_was really_good
i loved_this_place so_much
and_not just_because the_food_was_great it_was the_service_and recommendations we_received from the_staff
one_of whom i_was_pretty sure was the_owner
were enough_to give_stars
i_had ordered a_restaurant
com_coupon back_in march for_this_place and forgot about_it
so_when one_of_my friends was in_town and_we_were craving_indian_food
we of_course had to_stop
i_ordered mango curry_chicken and_my_friend had_lamb jalfrezi
and_of_course we added naan_and_rice to our_order
the_rice_was a_recommendation of_the server's one i_had_never had with_peas
white raisins
and nuts
it was_quite_good
and went_well with_what we_ordered
but i_am_going_to stick_to rice without all_the extras next_time
it_was pricey to_have that_much extra stuff in_it when_i just want some straight up plain_rice
the mango_chicken was_pretty much sweetened butter_chicken
but it_was_delicious
the_lamb was_a_little tough for_my_liking
but luckily that_wasn't my_dish
ha ha
sucks to_be my_friend
but_it_was minty and_delicious and had_a_nice flavor but was_a workout for_the teeth
we_went a_little overboard our restaurant
com_coupon and ended up spending another apiece
that's the danger in those things you_think you're_not going_to_be above_the limit and_then there you_are
paying_for stuff you didn't really_need
beer
that i_will_say was_good
just_not perhaps something_i needed_to complete the_meal
i_will_definitely_be_back i_want_to try their_buffet as_well as their_lunch
it_was_a_good dining_experience overall
with minor details not upsetting my star experience
now
i_love_indian_food_and basically will order_it every where_i travel to because i_always_get a_craving_for it
i_had_been thinking_about taj_palace for some_time now_and finally_got the_family to_try_it_out
a
ambiance strip_mall setting
plenty of seating arrangements and_for various size
perhaps you_can fit up_to about people
so_it_was decent size
good lighting

a
chicken_tikka_marsala ok
so_this is_really an english invented indian_dish and_not popular in_india
i get_it
just_like chop suey and fortune cookies in chinese cooking
these_were things invented not_in_the original country
i get_it
but man was this_dish uninspired
the_chicken_was cut in huge cubes
the_best way_to slice is to_take_the breasts and cut at angles to_get thin against the grain meat that_when cooked
produce an aromatic and tender_chicken
eating these chunks
was_like eating chunks

go_to
places
thank_you taj_palace
ordered_take_out the_other_night
we_asked the_guy taking the_order what their best_chicken dish_was and he_suggested karahi chicken
ended up ordering karahi chicken
palak_paneer
dal_makhani
naan_and roti for_our guests
when_we brought home the_order
we realized they_had given us shahi or karahi paneer instead_of the_chicken
i_called back and_the_guy was apologetic and offered_to deliver the_chicken to_us
since the_order had taken over minutes and_it_was_a busy saturday_night
we offered_to come_and pick_it up
points for customer_service as_they compensated by giving us_a complimentary pulao rice
and_some achar relish and corrected the_order
points for_the_food however
dal_makhani was extra creamy but tasted the_best of_the lot
palak_paneer was_ok
chicken karahi which_they claimed was_the_best chicken option was flavorless and_pretty tasteless
pulao was not_bad
pretty_decent
naan_and roti were well_made
they let us keep the_paneer karahi as_well
but unfortunately that was_pretty tasteless too
i_usually love leftover food the_next_day but_this i_was_happy to_get rid off
i_will_try them_again as_this may have_been_a freak day since they_were_busy
but_it_was disappointing considering our guests were looking_forward_to a_nice indian_meal and price wise the_place_is not_cheap
i_guess_i will stick_to the_buffet_for this_one
as somehow the_buffet experience has_been ok every_time but have_not had the_same luck with take_out orders
amazing goat_curry
masala mushroom
and above all
amazing_service
came_here fresh off_the plane and_we_were craving_indian_food so_we landed on_this strip_mall restaurant
i wasnt hungry to begin with but ended_up_going with_the large lunch_buffet
so_delicious
they_had goat that was_tender
the_server vigal was_very_friendly but_i_felt that_he hovered a_little_too much
some_people like_that
some dont
service_was impeccable though
food was_so_delicious too
dollar buffet_with custard dessert and_rice_pudding
reallyyyyy tasty
go
for_a_lunch_buffet priced_at
with killer garlic_naan_and_the best_service i_have_seen at an_indian_place
this_place gets stars automatically
the_food
well
it_was simply wonderful_and amazing_and delish and oh_so perfect
i_came_here solo for_lunch two days_ago for_the_first_time and_found the place_to_be a_hidden_gem
to_me
maybe not_to others
i'm_sure the_options might change daily for_the_buffet
but the_first two_things i_tried were_the_only two_things i_ate because_they_were that_good
the_lentils with_rice and_the_chicken_tikka_masala can't_go_wrong
for_some_reason i_just wasn't in_the_mood for lamb
but it_looked very_good
this_place_is_good and you_can't beat the_lunch_buffet price_and food
very_good_indian_food
not_as spicy_as i_would_like
but_the_staff offered_to give_me an_extra dose of_heat on_the side
the_chutney tastes so homemade and_delicious
will_definitely make this_place one_of_my regular dr in places to_go
this_is_one_of_my favorites places

this_is_probably one_of_the_best_indian places
the_service_was_friendly and_fast
we_ordered different plates and_it_was all_good
naan_are always_good
at_first there_was_only tables by the_end_of_the_meal there_was tables filled
definitely_going back_there for_the_lunch_buffet soon
i_had high hopes for my_meal at taj_palace
i_read the series of yelp_reviews and_even recall a_few friends stating it_was_a_good place for_curry
i_have_to presume
it_was_a bad night_for the team at taj_palace
as_much as_it pains me to_write a
negative
review
i_have_to be true to my_experience
we_arrived on friday_evening around
pm
the_yelp_reviews for taj were higher than ping kao my intended destination
upon arrival i_noticed the_large dining_room had a_total of three occupied tables
the_friendly waiters greeted_and seated our_party of_two promptly
to_make_a long story bearable i_will cut to_the chase
i_ordered_a medium butter_chicken
at
i anticipated a_fantastic dish
my_partner
ordered_a
lamb_dish
he_will write his own review
to_our amazement
the two_dishes did_not come_with naan or rice
we_ordered these items_on_the side
the_plain basmati_rice was
and_the_naan_was
the_food_came_out within ten_minutes
have to_give an_a for speed and_service during_the pre dinner service
this team was on_top_of it
there_were four servers for our_table
our_water was_never empty and_the empty or unused plates utensils disappeared quickly
so on to_the_food
i_will only speak to my_own dish
i_have_had several butter_chicken
murgh makhani
dishes_at different places
i_am familiar_with the expected flavor
this particular dish just did_not taste_like any butter_chicken
i_have_had in_the_past
the color of_the_dish looked proper but the_flavor_was off
it_almost tasted as_if they_used mayonnaise instead_of cream or yogurt in_the dish
it_was slimy and_did_not have_a_good flavor at_all
to supplement the_flavor the_meat within the_dish_was chopped into small bits
there_were also chunks_of bone
fat and bay leaf
it_was_just awful
some might say
you should_have sent it_back
i_have warded off sending any dishes back_at restaurants
there_are too_many horror stories
i simply did_not finish_it
the post dinner service left us sitting with dirty dishes_for twenty minutes
when the_two waiters finally collected the_plates they_did_not ask about our_experience and_did_not notice most_of my butter_chicken_was still in_the dish
i_do_not expect anyone to_read my_mind
it had_to_be a_bad night
maybe
i_will_try again in_the_future
ok
first a disclaimer
i'm british which may mean i_have overly high standards for_indian_food
that_said
i've_lived in_the_us for_years
so_i feel i_know what_to_expect
my_main gripes with_this_place were the_fact it's overpriced
for_rice after_ordering a lamb_curry
and_the_fact that_the_food was_bland
the waiter_asked how_spicy
mild
medium
spicy
and_i said medium
when_the_food game
it_looked nice
but_there_was very_little flavor_and no spiciness i_could detect
it_wasn't horrible
but_i've enjoyed indian_food_in mall food courts more_than the_food_at taj_palace
the_service started_off great
four waiters taking care_of the two_of_us
but_we_were oddly left for minutes_after we'd finished out food_with not a_waiter in sight
also_the booths were rickety
they_don't seem_to be attached to the_walls
so_i_could feel every_time the_person behind me moved
it's difficult_to describe this annoyance without sounding ridiculously petty
but_i spent most_of_the meal leaning forward at_an unnatural angle
i really_wanted this_place to_be_good
not least as i'd talked my_girlfriend out_of her favorite thai place that's in_the_same strip_mall
a_curry and_beer on_a_friday_night
the_stuff
englishmen's
dreams are made_of
maybe the_lunch_buffet_is great
and_that why this_place_has great_reviews
i_can't think_of any_other reason
ive been_back here_many a_time
i_am surprised_by_the buffet_at lunch_time it is_so_good
always a_winner
great customer_service
try_it all_you wont be_disappointed
finally
a_place_that rivals anything we've_had in surrey
which_is_a large indo canadian neighbourhood outside vancouver
the_mixed tandoori grill is terrific and_very low in fat
the_lamb_biryani was so_tender we barely had_to chew
i'm almost sorry we_found_this_place
as_all my diet plans are now totally out the_window
i've_been_here a_few_times_and the great_food_and attentive
friendly_service keep_me coming back
i_really_enjoy their_lunch_buffet
mainly because_i have so_many favorite_dishes that_it's difficult_to narrow it_down and choose one_or two_things for_dinner
their naan_bread_is tasty
doughy with_a light crisp
the_restaurant_is clean_and has_a_great ambiance
the_decor
from the_wall color to_the art is_beautiful and tastefully done
the_staff_is warm
inviting and very_attentive
ready_to clear your_plate seemingly as_soon as_you make_the gesture to push your_plate to_the side
had such_a_great time_at taj_palace
our_server vick was a_pleasant mixture_of cute and charming
we_were first timers at indian_food
and vick took_the time to_explain the_dishes
an_extra detail not gone unnoticed
the_food_was_delicious
so_flavorful
all in_all
it_was_a wonderful first_experience and_we can't_wait_to go_back
i_love_this_place
this_is hands_down_the_best_indian restaurant i_have ever_been_to
and i_have_been_to a_lot
the_buffet_is awesome_and comes_with your_choice of traditional or garlic_naan_bread
this_is_a haven for_any vegetarian looking_to experience great_flavor as_there are_many vegetarian_dishes to_choose_from
also for non vegetarians you_can enjoy_the delightful scrumptious chicken_dishes prepared by chef jaipal as_well_as_the vegetarian_dishes
if_you_like goat the_buffet includes a_wonderful goat_curry
when_ordering off_the_menu i_recommend_the lamb or chicken_vindaloo or_the lamb_and_chicken haryali
but_everything on_the_menu_is delicious
if you try_the_buffet keep in_mind that the_heat factor is_at a_level from
when_i order_off_the_menu i_like_it spicy so i_usually_go between
also the_service_is impeccable
every one is_friendly_and every now and_then chef jaipal will come_out and_say hello
if_you_love indian_food
this_is_definitely the_place_to_go
it_is_a well_decorated
charming indian_restaurant in_the_middle_of a_strip_mall on eastern
parking can_be_a hassle on_the_weekends for_dinner due_to it_being located next_to overly popular and equally overrated bjs
the_service_is_always incredible
the_servers_are friendly
accommodating and_extremely willing to_make suggestions to_get you out_of_the
chicken_tikka_masala
comfort zone
for_dinner
boyfriend had spicy vindalo
which_is chicken_cooked with_potatoes
spices
and vindaloo sauce which_is_the red variety_of sauce
it_was_not very spicy_as i_believe they modified it due_to fear of_us not_being able to handle the_heat
i_love my_food spicy
the_dish_was good
nevertheless
i_had_the spicy haryali
which_was chicken_cooked in spicy green sauce made_with onion
spinach
mint
cilantro and_green chili
once_again
it_was_very delicious but not_spicy
we_ordered side_of gralic naan
and_it_was_very_good
also
the_server suggested we_get peas pilau
which_was basmati_rice seasoned with_peas
nuts
and raisins
i_didn't_care for_the raisins_and probably_would opt for_just regular basmati_rice next_time
we_also shared an_indian variety_of beer based_on_the server's suggestion
it_was_good and_quite large
all in_all
the_food_was_good_and the_portions generous
but
the_total did leave a_bit_of_a sticker shock
i_think i'd opt for_the_lunch_buffet_and try to_sample more_of their_dishes
the_service
as_i mentioned before
was_superb
i_would_recommend_this_place if_you_are in_the_area_and craving quality_indian food_and_great_service
they_have_a good_selection for_their_lunch_buffet
have both veggie_and meat_options
always love_their dessert options and_garlic_naan
staff_is_friendly
best_indian_food_i've_had_in vegas
clean
polite
tasty
and a_wide_variety
my_only_complaint_is the_parking
keep up_the great work
yum
star customer service_was_awesome
they_really helped me_out as_it_was my very first_time really eating_indian_food
my_friend is_also on_a vegan diet and_they helped him pick the_foods he can_eat
extremely helpful
stars_for_the environment
handcrafted art and tapestry walls surround you_in the_restaurant_and it_feels kind of intimate and romantic
stars garlic_naan
don't leave this_place w out trying_it especially_if you're into bread and_garlic like i_am
it_is_so tasty i finished the_entire basket myself
stars chicken_tikka_masala
yum
buttery curry_and mildly spicy over_a bed_of their_rice
so_good
stars fried okra
my_friend_ordered spicy so_it_was a_lot to handle but the_veggies went really_well to compliment my_chicken
coming_back_for sure
my_mom is british
so_i grew up on_indian_food
brits love_indian like_we americans love mexican
i've tried dozens of restaurants and_even tried to_make_it at_home a_few_times
this_is_one_of_the_best indian_places i've ever_been_to and_it's certainly the_best in_las_vegas henderson
the_staff_is attentive_and polite
the_food_is_good and_spicy
and_the_mango shake is_delicious
that's_all you_need_to know now go_and try_it
great food_and_great_service
very_friendly staff_and right_in henderson
we_will_definitely_be_back
i_liked_it
very_good
spices were_excellent
i_really_enjoyed_the mint chicken and_the_mango curry
the_tandori was_a_bit salty and_did_not like_it that_much
otherwise
i_would_have given stars
however
i will_return to_this_place soon
this_place_is in_the_same plaza as bj's
and_it_is fairly easy_to find if you use_the turning lane in_the_middle_of_the block
i_arrived here_with some_friends on_friday afternoon shortly after lunch_hour
it_wasn't_too crowded
and they_got put tables together to_accommodate us sufficiently
we_went straight for_the_buffet without even thinking_about the_menu
although it's_pretty easy_to justify eating the_lunch_buffet here_when you_do look_at_the entree prices
the_buffet table nearest to_the clean plates is_clearly all_vegetarian items
and the_next table has meat_dishes
a_small salad_bar
and_desserts
all_the items_are clearly labeled by name and_with ingredients
while i_don't_remember all the_names offhand
i_loved_the chicken_korma
really_enjoyed_the vegetable_samosas and_chicken_tikka_masala
also_liked the_tandoori_chicken_and saag
spinach
and generally had_no issue with other_dishes except_for_the goat_curry
that thing does not taste_like goat
or like_any particular meat
also
your_choice of butter or garlic_naan_is brought out from_the_kitchen to_your_table
although i've_only been_to two lunch_buffets at_indian_restaurants
i_feel that there's enough good_food here_to grant this_place five_stars
with of_course some consideration that buffet_food is_generally not_on par with a_la_carte courses
check_it_out whether you_like_indian_food or whether you_just want a_change of pace
we_got delivery from here_last_night
a_tuesday
the_food_was_awesome
everything_was hot
crispy_and very_flavorful
the gentleman who took_my order_was very_polite_and made_sure to_get all_of our details correct
he recommended_the rice_with raisins_and cashew
which_was not to_be missed
it totally made_the meal
everything_in the_vegetarian appetizer platter was_still crispy
not soggy like_i expected from my_usual delivery experiences
the_portions_were generous but_not_too much to_finish
we_will_definitely_be repeat customers to_this fabulous gem of_a_restaurant
maybe next_time we_will dine_in for_the full experience
thank_you for_the yumminess
the staff_is_very_friendly
my_family loves it when_we go_here
we_have_tried many different_dishes from_the_menu and so_far
so_good we_have enjoyed all of_them
on_our last_visit the_waiter made_a bet with_us that we_would enjoy an indian_beer better_than what_we were_about to_order
and sure enough we like_it better
unfortunately
i_cant remember_the_name_of it_so i_need_to go_back soon
the_naan_bread and_chicken are fantastic
i_come_here for_the_lunch_buffet pm since_i can never make_up my_mind on choosing one item at_an_indian_restaurant
the_buffet rocks since_it's all_you_can_eat and a_great_way_to try_new_things
i'm a_huge_fan_of their paneer saag
aloo_tikki
tandoori_chicken_and chaana masala
their chutney selection is_great_and i_love_their pakkoras
the_manager is_always there making sure water is being refilled and making sure i'm enjoying everything
the_restaurant_is clean_and so is_the restroom
love_this_place
i_have_been seeking out good indian_food_since a trip_to seattle in
my quest is finally over
until_i move to minneapolis in september
we_tried_the mushroom matar curry_and_the lamb_tikka_masala
both delicious_with the zeera rice
the_flavors_were impeccable and the_portion_sizes were_perfect
friend of_mine also highly recommends the_tandoori_chicken
says it's_the_best in_town
we_also_tried the_green chili naan and_the_garlic_naan
we were_a_little disappointed_that the_green chili one was_not_as spicy as_it_was advertised
but the_garlic_naan surely made_up_for_it
i_will_be_back
probably more frequently than_the waistline on_my pants wants me_to
this_place continues to_be_a wonderful eating establishment
wonderful staff
super cheap lunch_buffet_with great choices
we finally_got the_time to_check_out_the dinner_menu
it_was_wonderful
the_menu had so_much to_choose_from
and we_tried new breads that we_never even heard_of
lots_of fun
nice_atmosphere too
be_warned the_dinner entrees_are huge
most likely intended to_share
we overbought the_first_time expecting_a cat dish_of curry
we should have_known better
all portions_were well_made and generous
they_offer_a few meal deals at_night
the_soup was_wonderful
we_have_been coming_here since and never_got sick
which_is_a big_deal for_us
we have_never_had lousy service
the_new manager is_always smiling
wonderful place
recommended
the boyfriend_and_i went_for_lunch based off_of yelp_reviews
it was_my_first_time trying_indian_food and_it_was okay
found_out i'm_not a_fan_of_indian_food
unfortunately
my_taste_buds didn't_have an_a ha moment
boo
i_was_really_excited about trying something new_and hoping to_find_a new favorite_restaurant
however
the_naan_was very fresh_and_tasty
much better_than trader joe's
duh cody
so_the yelpers did me right_on that review
the buffet_lunch was very_reasonably_priced at_around
and had_a_nice portion of_vegetarian_options as_well as carnivore options
the_service_was decent_and atmosphere was_ok
seemed clean until i_saw_the employee transferring food_from his pan into_the serving pan with_his bare hand
not_a_good moment for_me
being_a germ a phobe and immediately stopped eating
i_didn't share this with my_boyfriend in_an effort not_to completely ruin lunch and_the_fact that_he thinks i'm a_little ocd
had_it not_been for_this incident
i_would_have probably said_it_was an okay lunch
probably won't be re visiting taj
decided_to be adventurous and came_here because_of_the rating
the_service_was_excellent and_attentive at_all the_right times
food presentation_was nice
chicken_tikka_masala_and naan were_excellent
we_tried dishes_with naan_and drinks
spent over
will_be coming back
listen
there_are only_one or_two other_indian_restaurants that compare_to this_one in_town
mint_is great if_you_want real clean high_quality indian_food_with tiny portions
origin is_great if_you_want_a fine_dining feel and you_want_to pay a_lot
this_place_is_great if_you_want delicious_and huge portions
i_would skip any_other_indian place_in_town
i_have never_tried_indian_food before
so i_was_excited
when my_friend_and_i walked_in at_first we thought_it_was dead but_when we_came inside there_was actually a_lot_of_people
the_service_was_great
they_are very_attentive_and very_helpful
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala and_my_friend ordered_the_lamb mango curry
both_dishes was_delicious
have_to_order the_peas pillau and_the_garlic_naan
and their_mango lasse was_very refreshing
my_friend_and_i loves to_eat_and try_new places
since this_was_my_first_time trying_indian_food
i_would_definitely let my_friends know about_this_place and_i would_come_back to_try_more of their_dishes
i_was first introduced to_indian_food back_in riverside
california
a_number_of years_ago by_my significant other
who loves indian_food
i have_to_admit while_it was_tasty
it_wasn't anything i_was in_love_with
we_found_this_place because_it_is across_the_street from_our apartment complex
price wise
it's_a_bit expensive
but the_dishes_are amazing
my_first dish_was the_mango lamb_curry
mild spice_level
mind you
delicious
the_lamb is tender with_just a_bit_of fat and tendon to_make_it just_that more yummy
but_not make me_feel guiltyl for eating that extra stuff
my significant other ordered_a paneer dish
also_delicious
a_few_weeks after we_went_there
he discovered that taj_palace had_a lunch_buffet_for only
yay
all_their dishes_were scrumptious
during_the_lunch_buffet
i_tried_the goat_curry
some vegetarian platters
and_their peas pillau
the_goat in the_goat_curry was_as wonderful as_the lamb_in the_lamb_curry
their vegetarian platters were_all delicious_and_the peas pillau was gastronomically pleasing
we_have made several trips back_to taj_palace and_will probably_be making more
oh
and_one can't_go to_an_indian_restaurant without ordering naan
i_love_indian_food
this_place is_by_far one_of_my_favorite places to_visit in the_las_vegas metropolitan area
the_lunch_buffet_is only
and the_selection_is nice_and fresh
i_love_the tiki_masala
the_fresh garlic_nan and_the samosa's are also_pretty big and_flavorful
i'm_not_a vegetarian
but have_to_admit some_of their non meat_dishes are_also quite_tasty and_delicious
it_was hard for_me to_find_a decent indian_restaurant_in sin city
but this_location satisfied my_indian cravings and is_definitely_a spot to_check_out if you're visiting las_vegas
located_in neighboring henderson off_of_the freeway on eastern ave
i_had_a sudden craving_for_indian_food and_this_was the_only_place nearby
because_i read_the hours wrong
i_arrived about minutes_before p and therefore during_the time they're closed
their hours are_a to p
then p to
p
i_found something to_do in_the meanwhile because_i_was still craving_indian_food and arrived a_few_minutes after p
as_soon as you_enter the_restaurant
there_is_a strong aroma that may_be_a little overpowering
i_wanted_to do_the take_out option and_was seated at_the_bar waiting to_order
it_took longer than_i_expected
but the_people were_nice and_kept offering me drinks
they_took my_order
lamb_tikka_masala and_chicken_curry
and_i played on my_phone in_the meanwhile
a word_of caution
i_didn't order any naan because_i_had rice at_home
but it_looks_like just_one piece_of_naan is
one piece_of garlic_naan_is
no
thank_you
they arrived with my_food
i_paid
and_i_went home
i've never_really had_indian_food_before and fortunately
i was_not_disappointed with_my choices
both_the lamb_tikka_masala and_chicken_curry were_delicious
the_portions_were big enough that_i_had leftovers that still tasted_good the_day after
i'd_definitely go_back_and order more_food for_take_out
love_this_place
their_menu_is pretty pricey though
very_helpful staff
i_always leave with_more food_than i_should probably_be getting
definitely give their_lunch_buffet a_shot
very good_lunch_buffet
but usually the_same items
the_food generally has a_pretty_good and consistent flavor_and is prepared well
the_restaurant tends to_be_very quiet
which_is_great for_lunch time meetings
it's_also very_clean
service_is_very prompt
the_only ding on a_star is the_lack_of variety
every_time i've been_in it's the_same dishes with_no rotation
i'm sad it_took_me so_long to_try_this_place
great_lunch_buffet with_a mild to medium_spice
attentive_staff
very_clean_and well_decorated place
however
i_was_disappointed that they_didn't_have rice_pudding on their_buffet
the_food_is_good
but i_have_to warn you
if_your body is_not used_to curry
be afraid
lol
after recently relocating to_las_vegas
i_decided it_was time_to scout out a_place_to turn to when_i'm experiencing a craving_for_indian_food
i_wouldn't say i'm an expert
but_i spend most_of my_dining out experiences in indian_restaurants_and this_time
i_wasn't too impressed
disclaimer
i_have left behind the_perfect indian_restaurant where_i recently moved from and_i_know nothing will_ever compare
we_ordered paneer pakoras
chicken_tikka_masala
spice_level
and_chicken_curry
spice_level
the_paneer pakoras_were fresh and_fluffy
but lacked flavor or spice
the_sauce for the_tikka_masala_was okay
but_no amount of creamyness or richness would save the dry chunks_of_chicken
the_spice_level was_pretty_good
but_if_you like_spicy indian_food
you better order_something higher than_a because a is_the equivalent of mild
in_my_opinion
the_curry_was tender
but just_okay
nothing much_to report on_that
my biggest problem_with this_place_is_the price
the naan_and_rice are an_additional
not_to_mention the_fact_that each entree item is_about a_piece
yes
you_get a_lot_of_food
but_that's standard at any_indian_restaurant
the_naan_is nothing exceptional
either
our total bill came_out_to
which_is crazy
with as many_places las_vegas has_to_offer me
i_won't_be returning
the_staff_is nice
though
i'd_like_to amend my_review a_little now_that i've been_back so many_times
i've tried_the_lunch_buffet twice in two_days
i'm officially hooked
the_service_is pretty attentive
vimil
vick
is_very_friendly
he makes an_extra effort_to remember his customers_and takes pride in_his job
he's remembered my name ever_since i_paid with_a credit_card
him and_other staff always keep my_water_glass quite full
a_definite necessity in_an_indian_restaurant
we_got_there by about pm_and the_lunch_buffet closes at pm
at exactly
pm the_server came_over_and informed us_that they_were_closed and_it_was time for_us_to go
i_thought_this was_a_little abrupt
but_we_were mostly finished
so we_left
i_really_like_the varied options depending on_the day
the samosa's were_really_good
filled_with spicy potato
these_were a_little_spicy
but very_tasty
i poured a_little_bit_of mint_chutney over the_top and it_was_perfect
i_actually wished they_would_have had them the_second day
i_also really_liked_the chicken_tikka_masala
because i_love_the red sauce_that it comes_in
perfect_for dipping naan
there_was_also_a white cream based chicken dish_that_was really tender
on my_first_visit i_didn't_have room to_try_the tandoori_chicken on_the bone
but on_my nd visit there_was tandoori_chicken pieces and_they_were pretty tender
i_like my stuff super saucy
so_i dipped my tandoori_chicken in the_raita
spiced yogurt
and_it_was_delicious
garlic_naan_is the_way_to_go
i_love me some_garlic
the_naan has came out piping_hot
super fresh on every visit
also on my_first trip i_brought my vegan friend and_she had_a_lot_of options to_choose_from_and was_very_happy with_the selections
i_would_definitely_recommend telling the_server if_you_are vegan because one_of_the labels above the_food_was inaccurate
for_my second_visit i_brought two indian_food experts
they both agreed that_it_was_a pretty_good buffet
especially for_the_price
they seemed_to enjoy_the_food
but one_of_them felt_that the_dishes could_have used a_little_more spices
both of_them agreed they_would rather have the_dishes spicier
but realize that with_a buffet it's usually going_to_be mild to medium
i_would_definitely like to_come_back during_dinner and_try some_of_the menu_items
although i_think_i'll have_a hard time staying away from this_buffet
i_love having tons_of options_and you_can't beat the_price
about per_person
i_just moved_to the_area
and_this_is the first_indian i_have_tried in the_las_vegas metro
so_i_am comparing it_to the_only_other indian_places_i really_know
in_the kansas city metro
this_place sucks compared_to kc
nothing_was free
no papads given
no lassi or kolfti samples
not_even the_rice
you_had to_pay_for the_rice separately
it_wasn't very_good
either
the_food_was mediocre
i can_make a_better veggie_korma and i_am_a white girl from wichita
ks
the_service_was_very poor
i_won't_be in_a_hurry to_come_back
maybe i_will_try the_lunch_buffet at_some_point
maybe
great_food as per normal
just_a_little too_expensive for_indian though
however
i_have come_to expect that in_las_vegas now
ordered_take_out last_night and_it_was surprisingly fresh_and good
the_chicken_tikka_masala
aloo_gobi and mushroom mattar all tasted authentic
the_samosas_and naan were_excellent
i_have_eaten_at many an indian_cuisine resteraunt from_here to ontario
so i'd_like_to say my palate is seasoned
taj has good_food
alot better_than_the three other resteraunt's that_were here_that served canned curry_and canned veggies at_the_buffet
the_naan is_great_and compared_to their competitors it surpasses them easily
the butter_chicken_is flavorful_and nothing on_the_menu tastes artificial
ghandi's is_still my_favorite in_town
then orgin india and_this_place_is third
but if_you_want_a quick buffet that_is yumy and satisfies the senses
come_here
as_for customer_service they_are always_great
very_friendly_and funny
and i_love_the open seating
over_all stars
dang near perfect
best_indian_lunch buffett in_las_vegas
the_food_quality is consistent
the_staff_is_friendly
affordable priced
you can't_go_wrong if_you_like_indian_food
the_garlic_naan_is outstanding and_the_chicken_tikka_masala is_the_best i_ever_had
try_it
great_place_for buffet_lunch
unfortunately the_same exact food_is offered at dinner_for x the_price
strangely we_were at_the_buffet and_at were_told they_are ready_to close and asked_us to_leave
this_place_is_good
it's just_a_little overpriced for_my_taste
i'm better off making_it at_home
i_went_here for_the_first_time for_lunch
i_had_a great_experience
the_staff_is_friendly_and attentive
the_price_is great for_a_lunch_buffet
the_quality_of_the_food is_good
i_found some_of_the sauces a_little_too creamy for_my_liking
i_thought_the variety_of vegetarian and_meat_dishes was_good
i_wish the_buffet_had more dessert options
this is_my_new go_to place_for_lunch when_i want indian_food
we_visited this_place last_night for_dinner
there_were other parties dining there when_we_arrived
the_place_was nicely_decorated for a_strip_mall restaurant and_the_staff seemed friendly and_welcoming
nehil was our_waiter and the_experience we_had with him garnered taj_palace this_one star_review
another couple came_in after we_did and nehil spent minutes chatting with_the couple at the_next booth
talking about himself
when he_did stop_by to_take_our_order i_told_him that i_wanted the_vegetarian appetizer platter and_he_said
you don't_want_to order that
that's going_to fill you_up and_you won't eat the_entree
i_then ordered_a potato filled bread and_he_said
you don't_want_to order that
take the_garlic_naan
as_if he wants_to tell_me what to_eat
i deferred to my_husband who wanted the_half tandoori_chicken_and nehil said to_him
you don't_want_to order that
take the_fish entree
i_asked to_speak to_a manager and_he_said none was_available
i_then asked_for_a business card and the_name_of the_owner_and as_we_were leaving a_group_of men entered through_the back door
i spoke to one_of_them and told_them about_our experience_and they_just stood there dumbfounded
we_left and_had_a wonderful dinner somewhere_else
too_bad taj_palace you lost our business forever
the quote for this_place_is
guest is_as_good_as god
i_think not
my_bf took_me here_for_the_lunch_buffet and it_was_great
the_selection_of food_was sooooo much better_than_the other buffet i_tried over at_india_palace
we_even got fresh_naan
choice_of garlic_and regular
loved the_samosa and_the_mango chicken_curry
will_definitely go_back
this_is_a_great selection_of_food for_only
even just dish_is worth_the_price
in_our party_of on_a_saturday_night we had_one indian_food newbie and_a_couple greenhorns
we_asked the acting manager to_bring a_dish for_everyone to_share
family_style
that represents dishes of_which they_are proud
he beamed at the_opportunity and_the_staff_was incredible in their_service
those of_us who regularly love_indian_food couldn't have asked_for_a nicer
more friendly_and higher quality experience_with which to introduce friends to_this cuisine
i_even appreciate that they_took emphasis to_make_the vegetarian in our_group
me
feel catered among_the majority meat_dishes
i adored my tikka_masala paneer
rice
with pine nuts and raisins
and mushroom veg_dishes
and_everyone else raved for the_tandoor lamb ribs
curries
and_shrimp
i_wish_i were eating_indian_food like_this all_the_time and_with management staff who_is this splendid
no matter the_cuisine
but alas i_don't live_in_the vegas_area
taj_palace is_a treasure in_the land of ordinarily low expectations for nondescript strip_mall restaurants
after_my appointment
i_was hungry and_decided_to give_this_place_a try
they_had_a big sign out front that_said
best_of vegas
i_was_excited_to try_it
they were_only serving buffet bar
so that's_what i_got
my waiter was_not_very friendly
he did_not look happy_to be_there
the_buffet bar had_about different_items plus rice_and_a vegetable_samosa
i_was_a_bit disappointed_with_the selection
i_tried a_little_of everything
nothing really stood out
it_was_all just_ok
the_goat_curry was_mostly bones and gristle
ugh
if this_is_the_best_indian_food that vegas has_to_offer
i_feel sorry for_this town
great_food
i_have_been_to almost every indian_restaurant_in_the las_vegas area_and can_say without_a doubt that this_one is_one_of_the_best
sure it's a_little_pricey
but they_give_you huge portions
food_was_great
staff_was_very_friendly_and took care_of everything_i wanted
stop_by here
you_will_be glad you did
wonderful experience food is_fantastic and_service_is delightful
decent buffet
limited vegetarian_options but good_enough
nice place_to_eat
non_veg options seems_to be_great
great_food
good_selection_of veg curries at buffet
choose from
fresh_and_tasty garlic_naan
tastefully done interiors and_decor
clean bathroom with diaper changing station
our little one_was sleeping
she woke up mins before pm
close
and_they accommodated us_for mins after close while she ate
came_here_for dinner_with a_bunch_of friends and_got seated_right away since it_wasn't busy at_all
the_ambiance_is nice and_relaxing
there_was some incense burning and_although the_smell wasn't really all_that pleasant
i_got over_it eventually and didn't_think much_of it
for our_dinner outing
i_opted_for_the paneer_tikka_masala paired up_with_some garlic_naan
the_food_was alright but_nothing to_write_home_about
i_thought_the tikka_masala lacked flavor and_the_naan_was a bit_dry in_comparison to_what i_am_used_to at_other_places
other_people in my_party ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala and_i_decided_to get_in on it_just to_see_if there_was any difference in_flavor between_the two
surprisingly
there_was not
oh_well
i_came_to get fed and_that happened so_i_guess i'm good haha
luckily
someone in our_group had a_coupon to_take off some_of_the damage from the_bill
not_bad but_not enticed to_come_here on_a_regular semi regular_basis
i'd probably give_it another_chance but might expand to_other options on_the_menu instead_of my_usual indian comfort dinner dish
we'll see
rant
great stuff the_rice dishes_were as_spicy hot as i'd hoped they_were
and_the_tandoori shrimp were more_like tandoori prawns
real sized prawns
portions_were huge
that's always awesome
service_was_great
just what_i expected
answered questions
brought_us more water on_a_regular_basis
check came quickly
food_came quickly
etc
this_place_is way better_than mount_everest india's_cuisine
i_don't_know understand why that_place gets more stars than taj_palace
this_place_has better portions
comparable prices_and better service
and_the_food comes_out faster
after my_first_visit here
i came_back the_very next night for_takeout
more tandoori shrimp
basmati_rice
and the_usual chicken_masala
can't_go_wrong
if_you_want great_indian_food at_reasonable_prices
and you_have_a big stomach
definitely visit taj_palace

but_could use an upgrade in lighting and_decor
the_only indian_food_i've_ever eaten has_always been_in california
a tandoori_chicken leg
a piece_of_naan
rice
one type_of curry would_come up_to for one_person
at taj_palace
you_can_have all_of that_in a_lunch_buffet for_just
i'd say that_there_were about ten different_types_of curries
give or take
i_was ecstatic
everything_was_delicious
however
the_buffet ends at pm
and_i_thought the_menu prices were_a_bit high
i_probably wouldn't come_here_for dinner
this_indian buffet_is best in_las_vegas
we never_had bad_food here and_always satisfied_with quality_and reasonable_price
this is_one_of_my_favorite restaurants_in_las_vegas
hendertucky's indian_restaurant
not_a food cart or truck behind a grocery_store or_a converted gasoline station
it's a_real dedicated indian_restaurant with real_indian decor
i understand it been under new ownership for two_years plus
it's our_first_visit under_the present ownership
we_came for_the_lunch_buffet around_pm this friday
there_were still a_few occupied tables and_the_buffet carts were filled_with food
of_course i_ordered their_garlic_naan plus a kashmiri naan
it_was most disappointing
yu go chauffeur always eats the_veggies first_and saves the_meats for the_second plate
he_loved the_spiciness_of the_veggies but_he thought the_meats were_a_little underseasoned
but_not a_problem
he dunks everything_in their green
white and red sauces anyway
it's_a charming place_to relax and_enjoy which_we certainly can attest to
best_indian_food every love_the coconut curry_and_the samosas are_the_best
i_cant wait to_go_back
this_place_has authentic_indian_food
the_service_is_great
the_prices unbelievably low and_the_food quality_is extraordinary
i_have_been eating_there for_over two_years and i_have_never_had a_bad_experience
if_you_go for_lunch
they_have buffet for_only
and_it's totally_worth it
highly_recommended
great_service
very friendly_and_helpful
food_was_great
better than_i_expected
i_hate it when_i ask_for spicy_and_it comes_out mild but_this_place did_not_disappoint
overall the_food_was_very_good
this is_going_to_be my_go_to place_for good_indian_food
just finished our third visit
second dinner_here
we_got_the non_vegetarian meal_for two
everything_was_great
spiced to_our request of medium heat_level on the_lamb_and soup
we_have enough left_over for_lunch tomorrow and_we_are both stuffed tonight
there_was lots_of flavor_and every_dish was distinctive unto itself
there_were only_two other_tables with patrons and nobody else came before we_left
too_bad as the_food_and_service are_both quite good_and_i for_one want_to see_them busy enough_to insure they_are here for_a_long_time
my_friend_and_i visited on_a_friday_night
it was_a_tad busy
but_otherwise ok
there_were_some hiccups in service
however the_food made_up_for_it
i_had_the_chicken skewers with peanut satay
along_with_the lemon chicken
i_must_say both_were absolutely_delicious
the lemon chicken_was the best_i've_had_in ages
they_have_a great_selection_of unique mixed drinks that were_delicious as_well
the_best_indian food_and_service in_lv
henderson
i've been_coming here_since this_place opened
the_lunch_buffet_is great
love the_goat
mango_chicken and samosa are_great
one_of_the_best_indian buffets around
definitely check lunch it_out if_you_like_indian_food
wait_staff_is on top on service
buffet had_a_very good_selection_of both vegetarian_and
carnivore
entr es
they_even had_a goat_curry
for_the_price of
per_person
it's_a worthwhile find
great_lunch_buffet
lots_of variety_of vegie curries_and meat curries including goat or lamb
some_good chutney and_sauces and_fresh vegetables
the_naan was_pretty_good
extremely clean_place and nice_atmosphere
however the_lunch_buffet_was pretty pricey
i_would_go more often if_it weren't for_the_price
i_will travel further to_find good_value
the_chicken_tikka_masala is_to_die_for
the_servers_are very efficient and_nice
right when you_sit down
they_bring over water
indian chips
and_two sides to_dip the chips in
the_green one_is pretty_spicy
be aware
the_red one isn't as_spicy
but so_great
today we_had_the spiciness a
which_was almost a_little_too spicy_for_me but_still_good
i_haven't_tried the_buffet
but_will soon for_sure
i_highly_recommend_this_place
the_atmosphere_is_nice and_welcoming and i've_never_had to wait_for_a_table
i_am_so in_love
absolutely_amazing flavor
beautiful set_up
and_extremely friendly_staff
we will_be_going back
after_a hike yesterday
we_stopped here for_their_lunch_buffet
it_was_almost empty when_we_arrived but_we must have_been_a draw because business picked up while_we_were there
they brought_us ice water_and we_ordered garlic_naan
in_fact
we_ordered_a second basket_of garlic_naan before_we even started_with_the first
it was_quite_good
the_first part_of the_buffet_had all vegetarian_dishes
some_of_the standouts here were the_pakoras
large triangles filled_with a_spicy mix_of vegetables
and the_saag
the_saag had excellent flavorings and was_very_tasty
i_also_tried some_of_the lentils and_they_were also_good
in the_second section
i_had_some goat_curry
chicken_tikka_masala
and_tandoori_chicken
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was standard as_was_the goat_curry
the_tandoori_chicken_was a bit_dry
a_couple_of things_i noted that_were different
there_is no silverware on_the_table
you pick up utensils at_the_buffet when_you're there or you go_back_and get if you forget
i_was_expecting some_kind_of mtv india music_playing or video
but_they had_their tv off which_was quite ok
but instead
we_had pop music which just_didn't seem_to fit the_place
the_room is pleasant
service_was_ok
and the_lunch_buffet_was good
there_are_a few standout items as mentioned
i_didn't_have dessert
not_even kheer
which almost unheard of for_me
the_naan filled me_up quite nicely along_with two plates_of food
tried_the_lunch_buffet and_it_was_delicious
also_had_the mango yogurt drink
loved it_and_it definitely helped with_the spicy_food
if_you_can't take the_spiciness
you_can ask_for this white sauce thingy that_you_can add_to your_food to_make_it less spicy
which_i did
lots_of vegetarian_options
but_also had goat and_chicken entrees
the_buffet even had_some desserts such_as watermelon slices and_rice_pudding
the_service_was amazing
the_waiter kept the_water refills coming and_took the dirty dishes right away
and lastly
the_interior decorations and_the_ambiance of_the_restaurant is_perfect
very indian_style and great_for groups or_even dates
had_the_lunch_buffet here
such a_great_deal for_the authentic cuisine
everything_was_delicious
especially paired with_the fresh garlic_naan
the_restaurant_is nicely_decorated and_had_a warm
inviting feel
great_place_to stop_by with_a_group or_even for a_date
the_staff_was courteous_and made_sure we_were taken_care of
great_food
great_atmosphere
i'm_so stuffed
and we're taking most_of_the_food home in doggy bags
would've included_a picture but_everything looked so_good we dug in before_we realized
sorry i've been passing this_place_for years
finally made_up my_mind and arrived_at
today
sure glad_that i_need
the_food_was first class buffet
did_not eat any_of_the pure vegan_dishes
not_my preference
the_various rices were_fresh and_fluffy
nothing looked_like ye
sterday
all the_meat_dishes were surprisingly delicious
nothing_was over spiced
just_right
my system does not tolerate spices very_well
the_rice_pudding desert was different but excellent as_well
service_was spot_on
one_of_the tests of restaurants
for_myself is_the cleanliness of the_rest rooms
five_stars clean here
i'm_sure to be_back in_the_future
everything_was amazing
tender meat delicious sauces
menu needs more pictures because the_food_is even prepaired beautifully
they_can serve jain food
a classy and sophisticated restaurant at a_few miles distance from vegas_strip
delicious_food_and the_staff_was_very_friendly to_accommodate our jain food requirements
try the_paneer butter masala
totally_worth it
don't_forget
yelp_check_in provides free_mango_lassi
i_love_this little restaurant
everything on_the_menu is_delicious_and the_service_is_always great
their butter_chicken_is amazing
and_the lentil_soup has really intricate flavors absolutely_delicious
i_also love their_chicken_tikka and_tikka_masala you_really can't_go_wrong_with any dish here
and don't_forget e garlic_naan
tasty_food and friendly_staff
been coming_here a_few_years
the_prices have risen lately
but_still within my budget for_indian_food
been_here about a_couple_times now and_i_must_say i_like_the place
service has_been pretty_good
the_staff_are friendly_and_attentive
the_food takes longer to_make and prep
in_my_opinion
but worth_the_wait as_soon as you_get_to eating
what i've gotten the_last two visits are_the infamous tikka_masala_and chicken_tandoori
tikka_masala famous dish in_all indian_places that_they guarantee all first timers will like
pieces_of moist
tender_chicken cooked_in_a tomato y
gingery sauce
very rich_and hearty
suggest_you dip their freshly baked garlic_naan in_this sauce
chicken_tandoori sizzling
marinated chicken_cooked in the_tandoor
on_a bed_of peppers_and onions
seasoned very_well
comes_out in the_red color because_of_the spices
moist_and a_little_spicy for_my palette but_i_still love_the dish
great to_eat with_their basmati_rice
i'm glad_we took_our friend
sandra r
here for_her first_time
a_bit scared at_first because she hated the_smell that_all indian_places have
she liked_it
definitely ate everything_on her plate
upon paying and getting ready_to leave
the_waiter_was so sweet
providing a_small bowl_of mango_ice_cream and put_a candle on_it because_it_was her birthday
small gestures are a_plus
will_definitely be_coming back_when craving_indian_food
i_hope to_try_their buffet_style one_day
but available only from monday sunday
am to
pm
late nite munchies and_beer a_winner on leith
with_their fantastic bar menu this_place_has become a_real late_night hit with leithers
as one_of_the only places with_a am closing time this_place_has become_a buzz with late_night customers
they_serve up_some cracking naans and dahls as_well as_an assortment_of tasty seafood done in stunning fresh tasty sauces
if_you_have read many of_my reviews you_will know how_i feel about seafood
they_have theirs delivered fresh from newhaven ona regular_basis and it_really shows
for_a meal its_not a_place for_a_quick bite to_eat
best to_order some nibbles and_enjoy a_beer as due_to_the fact the_food_is made_to_order the waiting times can_be quite long
but hell is_it worth_it
lip smackingly good spice_and ferocious flavour
jd happy man
p

a_must_try for_any leither

p
s non leithers stay away its our you cant have_it
after_a_long wait i_was finally at guchhis last_night for_dinner
my_partner was_there for_a meal a_couple_of_weeks back and_thought the_week day tapas menu was_tasty_and good_value
maybe if we'd had_this option i_would_have left with_a slightly more positive feelings about_the_place
on_the plus side
it_was_a_nice
bright restsurant with_good space and_a friendly atmosphere
the_staff_were_very attentive_and went_to_the effort of preparing my_friend a_surprise birthday pudding
however
i
and_quite a_few_of our_group
felt the_menu_was extremely over_priced for_what turned_out_to be fairly ordinary food of extremely small_portions
i_was_quite looking_forward_to my_first ever tandoori dish_which
at
proved to_be_a more_than_a wee bit dissapointing when king prawns turned up_on a_plate
tasty though they_were
they_were far_from exceptional
the_house wine was_also_a let down
a_cheap supermarket wine
normally found_in for offers
cost us
and_we_were only glad the_curry killed the_taste
i'd go_back_and give_this_place_a second chance with_their tapas menu
but suggest for the_future they either lower their_prices or increase their portions
and definately get_their wines sorted out
failing that
i'd take the_money i_would_have spent
hopped on_a bus to methven in perthshire and_eat another_meal of_the_most amazing indian_food_i've_ever_had
a_restaurant by the_name_of chatni
we_have_been a_few_times_and we've always had great_service_and fantastic_food
their indian tapas is a_great_deal
and_their dahl is my_favourite in_edinburgh
a_great addition_to leith
had a_lovely meal at guchhi on saturday_night
the_place_was busy
but_overall it didn't_feel harried to_dine there in_fact
it_was_the opposite
the tapas dishes were_tasty
black lentils all chipotle smoky goodness
what a_surprise
with only_the chargrilled prawns feeling_like the poorer child
but_only in flavour
but beautifully cooked
aloo chana was_fantastic_and sealed the_meat eating silent reviewer's fate as_a chickpea lover
it won't be long now til i_get him off bovine and onto bream and broccoli
sweet and_sour haddock had a_lovely delicate flavour much_more understated than_that of_the chinese variety
for_me
i_wasn't a_big_fan_of the_naans we_ordered
i_found them too thin_and dry
but_the sr disagreed on_that particular point
and tapas dishes more_than plenty
especially_when sharing
even_though_i really did want_to squeeze in_the scallops with chilli butter
we_just couldn't
but
it's a_place i_want_to return_to
so hopefully next_time
i_will
i_really_enjoyed guchhi
i_thought the_quality_of_the dishes was_very high
and_the tapas selection had_a_really good_variety to_it
service_was first rate and i_liked_the decor of_the_place
too
well worth_a_visit
i'd say
overall
we_said
guchhi was_really rather good
offering satisfying dishes at_a_very reasonable cost
it's_a_great late place
given_that it serves until am
so_i_can imagine it's somewhere we may well visit_again for late evening nibbles
ended up down_the shore trying_to avoid the festival madness on_a rainy sunday_afternoon and happened on guchhi by accident
the_food_was_excellent we_had_a mix_of mussels
scallops
madras and chicken_pakora on_their tapas for deal
the_nan and pilau_rice that we_ordered were_a step above the_average too
if you_find yourself down_the shore i_would definately recommend a visit_to guchhi
great food_and_service
swings and roundabouts i_have_to_say for guchhi
i've_been_here a_number_of times as_it_is literally minutes walk_from where i_live and tapas in_any cuisine_is my preferred way_of eating
the_first couple_of_times i_went my_partner and i_loved_it
the_quality_of_the meat
seafood and cooking was_excellent
the_same goes for the_service
excellent
however recently when we've been_in we've_had mix ups with our_order
which we_ended_up paying_for
and_the_quality_of_the dishes served just_didn't seem_to be up_to scratch
i_ordered_the_chicken pakora in_there last weekend and_some_of_the chicken came out raw in_the_middle
not good_if you're nearly months pregnant like_me
i_don't_think i'll be_back there until a_number_of reviewers convince me otherwise to_be_honest such a_shame as it_does have potential
this_place is_the_best_indian_food my_wife_and_i have_ever_had
the service_is_excellent the_atmosphere_is perfect
if you havant been you_have_to go
you won't_be_disappointed trust us
scott nikki
i_went_to guchhi on_a_saturday evening a_couple_of_weeks ago
stars might appear a_bit frugal to some_of_the yelpers who swear by this_place but_i_can assure you i_did_not make_the decision lightly
it_was carefully calculated by using a system which shall be explained in detail if you read on
the_waiter took our_drinks order_and asked_us if_we_wanted poppadums to_start_with which we_said yes to
the poppadums arrived with mango_chutney and_a hot and_sweet onion dip which_we demolished within seconds
we_ordered items from_the tapas menu the_chilli tandoori kind prawns
chilli butter scallops
butter_chicken_and lamb_rogan_josh with pilau_rice and peshwari_naan
the_waiter appeared a_bit concerned that we_only wanted tapas dishes between us_and asked_us several_times if_we_were sure_we only wanted those many
he almost seemed_like_a salesman whose commission earned was directly proportional to_the dishes_we_ordered
the_chilli tandoori king prawns beautifully spiced_and cooked_to_perfection stars
butter_chicken pretty average stars
lamb_rogan_josh lamb was_nice_and tender but the_sauce wasn't_very flavoursome and missed the oomph that_i_had expected
stars
the_chilli butter scallops highly disappointing
we_got tiny
circumference of_just over_a pence coin
scallops in_their shells smothered in sauce_which completely overpowered the delicate scallops star
the score averages to
stars
it_may seem unfair but_i_had to_take away
for_being charged separately for the_dips that were_served_with the poppadums which we_hadn't explicitly ordered
it could've just been a_bad day at_the office for the_chef and_i do hope i_am more impressed the_next_time_i visit
l o c a t i o n
the general area_of commercial street at the_bottom of leith is getting better
although quite industrial at points
there_is_a real sense that in_years to_come it_will_be a_lovely polished letter
l
g u c h h i
inside the_decor_was quite fresh
not over crowded and_quite typically modern_indian in_my point_of view
if_you_get what i_mean
neat
tidy
relatively classy but_not ott
spacious
respectable
and_all pulled together with soft mellow music_playing in_the_background
o f f e r s
speaking of
classy
a_group_of us had_a_groupon vouched for tapas dishes_and cocktails
worked out_about
each with_this offer
however
we_did add on two naan_breads
rices
and were_offered poppadoms_and dips at_the start
which we_did actually think were complimentary
and ended up not_being
add a_bottle_of rose and_a cola to_this and the_total for added bits and pieces came_to
so pretty much another per_person for_the poppadoms dips
half_a naan_bread half rice
a glass_of_wine and a_shot of cola if_we_had done so which_is reasonable per_person but was_quite sneaky regarding the
chip
poppadoms
dip
having said_that
per_person for what_we_had was_quite_good
the_menu_was filled_with things i'd never_heard_of
being_a less than part time indian foodie
so_it took_us a_while_to order but we_finally got_there
f o o d
as a_group we kind of ordered a_bit_of everything_and planned to_have_a nibble of_everything don't think_it really happened with_us
probably cause the_table was smothered with_an array_of different_indian cuisines
but_the overall quality_of_the_food was_good
there_was nothing i_would_say that_was negative about_the_food but_also i'd say that_there_was nothing spectacular about_it either
one_of_the dips that_was served_at the_start with_the poppadoms was_a spiced sauce_with chunks_of lime
it_was odd as_i first thought_it_was some_sort_of vegetable but upon realising it's super juicy sour taste i stayed away from that_one
i_suppose it was_kind_of mixing the super hot chili with_the lime to_get_a balance
g o o d f o r
groups
couples
friends
bar
open until am which_i presume the_bar will_be occupied mostly and_also maybe for late_night food servings it delivers so_i presume it caters for_take away also
i_want_to preface this entire review with
it_really should and could_be at least a four
and_it's_a really_nice place_and i_liked_it
i_was swithering between three and two_stars
but_i'm giving_it credit for potential
guchhi really has the_stuff to_make itself a hero of leith
and_i regret this will read as_a pretty negative review
because instead_of one big flaw dragging it_down
which_i could mention in passing and scoot on by
there_are lots_of little things_that will_take longer to talk_about
making this probably sound more_like_a two star_review
so
again
reiterating it's a_really_nice place_and i_liked_it
however
it's looking a_bit tired on_the_outside the_door frame is peeling and tattered
but_once i_got in
i_felt myself smile
because_it's really quite lovely
big high ceilings
clever decoration
a_very lovely swinging egg chair
i_want one
warm_and toasty
and_a general sense_of elegance
we_came on a_groupon deal_for four tapas and_two cocktails at_about
i_can't_remember the_exact amount
and_were fully prepared for a_lovely seafood feast
however
the_waiter swiftly informed us_that all fish was_off
shellfish
fine
but_no fishywishy
it hadn't come_in off_the boat
well
i_mean
i_thought_that the_good part_of that was_that_the fish they_serve is_fresh
but the_bad part is_that_the fish they_serve they_actually don't serve
the manner in_which the news was delivered to_us suggested that_this_is very_much standard routine at lunchtimes
half the_menu
at least
is_out_of bounds
o
kay
so_i plumped for_a clam starter
sarah l had_the mussels
and we_both went for_a chickeny thing for_main
a_big plus point is_that my fear with tapas is_a lack_of size
and_with only four between us i_thought_i would leave very hungry
even_though_we added some_rice and chapatti to our_order
but that_wasn't an_issue here
i_had a_bit_of_a job digging around to_find_the clams inside_the shells under all_that sauce
but despite their playful game of hide and seek
they_were plentiful and_tasty
my_first clam experience
the_butter_chicken i_had for_main was_nice i'm not_sure i'd pay the_price on_the_menu for_it
but_it_was nice
more my kind of thing than_the clams
in_fact
since_i'm a_fan_of all_things chicken
it's_also worth noting that_we_had booked the deal_for last_week
but_they rang up_and asked_us to_change it due_to some kitchen issue or other
the_deal included cocktails
but alas
there_was_a mocktail fail
i_think what_i_was delivered was_actually
basically
just mango juice
it_was_nice
sure
but the_girl had vowed some_kind_of mocktaily thing
ah yes
the_girl
there_were two tables occupied ours
and_another table of_two
it's_quite a_big place
so_it's a_shame that_it_was so empty on_a_friday lunchtime in such_a good location
i_guess sometimes i'd_be inclined to forgive cold_and unsmiling service if a_place were heaving with_people
thinking
gosh
it_must be_so tough to deal_with all of_these people
i_know i_could never do this job well
but_really
when there_are four people_in your restaurant
it's_not hard_to raise a_bit_of conversation or_at least smile
rather than saying the bare minimum
this wasn't voucher treatment
i_know some_people say they're ill treated because_they come_on a voucher
because she_was like_it from_the off
before sarah presented the voucher
so
she_was just naturally mardy
so
in summary
no fish dishes
in_which they're supposed_to specialise
unfriendly and somewhat dilatory service
lame attempt at some_kind_of non alcoholic cocktail
but nice_place
decent_food
good portions
i_do want to_go_back
perhaps in_an evening
and try_it_again
because
like_i said
it's lovely or it ought to_be
it's got all_the potential
and_it clearly has_been for other yelpers in_the_past
i've_only been once
but_i'll certainly_be returning
a smaller
unassuming indian family restaurant serving south_indian_food
we_went off_the beaten track and_ordered food i'd never seen anywhere else before battered mashed potato
stunning
chili idli
stunning
and_lamb tanjore
very_nice
we_also_had_a paneer dosa that_was fantastic
their home_made lemonade was_lovely
certainly worth_trying
the_food_was_very fresh
the_service_was fairly quick considering_that the_meals were_being prepared fresh we_saw the_dosa being made
very_much like_a fresh pizza
marked down from because_of it being_a cash only establishment
leading to_some pocket searching between us
they_really do need_to get card payments sorted out
gorgeous food vast tablecloth sized dosa pancakes wrapped around spicy potato fillings
with a_selection_of dips and_sauces alongside
the chennai fish_curry was_delicious
and_the crab curry just amazing
once_we worked out how to_eat whole little crabs
it's a_bit_of_a bare wee room
and noisy when lots_of people_are in
but it's_worth_it for_the_food
curry good
pancake good
curry pancake great
south_indian_cuisine is becoming more popular these days and with_good reason
as_it always feels a_bit lighter than the_usual curry stodgefest
i_think curry_is much improved by_the additional tastes and textures of dosas
idlis and_other doughy delights
especially in combination with the_various dips and_sauces that always accompany them
check out_my photo to_see_how huge the dosa_is
everything_is fairly cheap so it's_easy_to try a_number_of small things
and if_you_can't decide what to_have for_your main
just_about everything comes_in a mini starter size
i_would_be happy just dipping pieces_of the light pancake in_all_the delicious dips and_sauces
but_when you also have_some tasty curry inside
it's_the gift that keeps on giving
if you're bored of the_usual curry standards then this_place_is for_you
mmmm
crepe wrapped curries
family_owned
super_friendly
b
y
o
b
too
for south_indian style cuisine
tanjore is_the_best we've found in_edinburgh
so_far
their dosas have considerable wow factor
and_made me_a convert to_their cause
the_place_is very welcoming
keeps things nicely informal
and_you have_a_good opportunity_to see the_chefs at work
dishes_are high on flavour
and represent excellent value
overall
we_said
i_was highly impressed_by tanjore
for_this style_of south_indian_food
it was_as_good as i've experienced in_the_city
this_is_definitely a_place_that i'll be visiting again
in_the_future
so_if_you like_the sound of_it
do give_me a shout when_you're planning to_go
as i'd be_happy_to join you
i_love_this_place
it_is_so authentic
it reminds me_of being in_india
the_staff_are wonderful
the_space is_clean_and bright
the_menu_is overwhelming
it_is cheaper than the_vegetarian restaurant kalpna which_is just_a_few doors down
though_i can't decide which_is best
i_have_to_say that the_dosas at kalpna are_the_best i_have_tried in_edinburgh
but tanjore does a_good job
there_are_so many_options
including uttapam
idli
dosas and thalis
i_usually_go for_the addictive masala_dosa
which_comes accompanied with_various chutneys_and sambar
if_you_want_to try really authentic_indian_food
do come_here
expect great_service in_a casual setting and_really lovely food
i_recently joined blythe r here_for_lunch with_the purpose of reviewing and we_were_both pretty well impressed_with_the place_but i'll_try to stick_to my_own opinion here as_you_can see his below
first up
i wandered in_on my_own and made_a pig's ear of communicating my booking arrangement to_the staff_and somehow got sat at the_wrong table
only_to realise that another large table_was being quickly set_up because_i_had sat at the_wrong one
when realised my booking was for_two and_not six and
embarrassed
communicated this
i'm_sure they_had already realised
they_didn't show the slightest irritation and happily moved my to_another table
service_was exemplary
friendly and_efficient
once our_orders of dosa
idli and utthapam were taken
there_was a_bit_of_a wait
but_this_was deemed well_worth_it when_it emerged that our_food had_been made_fresh to our_order
and_was frankly delicious
we_wanted for nothing throughout_the_meal as service remained attentive but not_at_all intrusive
another great part_of_the experience_was that advice we_received regarding the_menu_was honest and we_weren't up sold or overly full by_the_end
the_value is_as great_the south_indian_food and_i_will_be going_here again
soon
we_had_a hankering for_some south_indian_cuisine so we_thought we'd check out tanjore
our_meal was_incredible
we_had_the crab curry_and_a masala_dosa
the_masala_dosa is a_south_indian classic and these_guys really_do it justice
the soft shell crab curry_with coconut rice was_pretty mind blowing too
full_of interesting textures and flavours
everything seemed_to be_prepared fresh using fresh_ingredients and herbs
the_restaurant_was clean and_the_service_was prompt_and friendly
i've been_going_to tanjore ever_since it opened i've_been_to and ordered_from many a indian_restaurant in_edinburgh and_i_have_to_say no other_indian_restaurant comes close_to beating tanjore in price or taste
i've tried quite a_few_dishes on_the_menu_and a_few_of the new_dishes as_well_and i've_never_had anything to_say other_than amazing for_all of_them
i_can't name any favourites as i_love all of_them
go and_try for_yourself
highly_recommended
wow
this_is authentic
i've never been_to_india but dined with_people who_had and_even they_were_very much impressed_by tanjore
from_the minute i stepped in the_door
i_felt_like i_was_in india
at least how i'd imagined a_restaurant in_india would look
the_decor_is great with_indian wall hangings on_the walls_and ceiling
giving a cosey
decorative feel
i_had_a masala_dosai
something i'd never_heard_of before_but which_was recommend to_me
so_tasty
i_love_indian_food_and i'd say i'm a_curry girl through and through
but_i couldn't help but get excited when_i caught sight of_the giant curry filled crepe presented before me with_a range_of sauces_and dips
most_of which_were to my_tastes
although_i wasn't_too keen on the_mint dip
they're a_generous size but light_and just_as filling as a_main course should be
i_had_a mango_lassis which_is_a thick mango flavoured drink
almost_like a milkshake
it was_so_delicious that_i struggled not_to finish_it before my_meal arrived
we_had_a range_of desserts to_share which_were incredible too
everything_i had to_eat_in tanjore blew my tastebuds away
the_service seemed a_little_slow but perhaps we_only noticed since_we_were in a_bit_of_a rush
they_don't accept cards so remember to_bring cash
we_had_to pop out to_get_some
all in_all
a taste_of_india in_edinburgh
i'll happily return
for_a fairly impromptu mid price meal_in honour of_my friend's new flat and job
tanjore did_the trick nicely
the clean_and compact interior feels welcoming enough and fuses east and west nicely with elephant embroidery on the_ceiling around a classic chandelier
we_both boggled at_the sheer range on_offer within_the menu's numerous pages which include an entire page devoted solely to vegetarian starters before eventually selecting our_meals
she plumped for chennai fish_curry with_mint rice
and_i_decided on chicken tanjore with lemon_rice
we_were_both happy_with_the delicate balance_of flavours in_our curries
and_my friend's mint rice was_pretty special too
the sweetness of_the parotta was_also_a great accompaniment to_the spicy flavours of_the_other food
the_service
though
was_a_little laboured and perfunctory from most quarters
we_had three different waiters over_the course of_the_evening
a_special mention goes out to_the young chap who served us last
though
with a_smile that lit the_room
i_was waiting_for my_friend to_arrive for_a_good ten_minutes and_was_not asked_if_i wanted a_drink
similarly
nobody checked_on us during our_meal to_see_if everything_was ok
our bill_came to_just under
which_is really rather good_for what_we_got
but_i can't help feeling that the_experience would_have left_a warmer glow in_my memory if the_staff had_been a_little_more attentive_and personable
i_wouldn't object to_another trip here but_it's_not somewhere i'd specifically recommend
been_wanting_to come_here since the_place opened_and finally_got organised this weekend
the_restaurant looked a_bit tightly packed_with tables
but_once seated there seemed_to be plenty of space
modern asian decorations with_some interesting touches here_and there
nothing too out_there and it_did manage to conjure up a_comfortable feeling to the_place
the_service_was_great from_the minute we_got in through to getting the_bill
the menu_is_extensive with_some really interesting bits and bobs i_haven't seen elsewhere
the_waiter discussed the specials with_us and_the orders_were in
papadam and dips were_a highlight nothing too exciting about the_dips but_the pickle was different to_any others i_have_tried
it_seemed_like it_was homemade rather than from_a jar
thumbs_up from_me
we_ordered papadams and it_looked more_like or we_were given
d
the starters were met with mixed options the_chicken_and squid tanjores were_excellent as were_the accompanying salads
the rasa vadai seemed_a_little strange we_hadn't had vadai before_but it_didn't leave an experience that we_wanted_to repeat in_a_hurry
the rasam it_was severed in was_lovely though
just in_case you_haven't tried_it
rasam is_indian tomato_soup and well_worth a_try
the_mains were mixed and_i forget what my_dinner companions ordered but_everything was_excellent
both veggies_and carnivores alike loved there choices
i_went_for_the special of_the_day which_was rice with_a_mango tamarind fish_curry with idli on_the side
lidls were new to_me_and were steamed rice_and lentil cakes
they didn't_really taste_of much but they_did go well_with_the curry
the_curry had lots_of fish but the_tamarind was overpowering everything leaving the_dish tasting a_little bitter
it was_really_nice just not_great
i_will_be heading back_to_try some_more of_the_menu as i_think_the special didn't_really work for_me
but_my companions loved_their curries
if the_fish_curry had_been a_little_more mango and a_little_less tamarind this_would_be_a star_review
as_all the_other_dishes were_amazing
this_was_a rather surreal experience i_wasn't blown_away at_the_time
but_the more i_thought about_my dosa
the_more i_liked_it
and_the more i_wanted_to go_back
so perhaps this_is_a
star really rather than_a
anyway
buyer beware it's cash only and byob
next
loads_of vegetarian_options and_lots_of interesting_and exciting sounding things_that really got_the mouth_watering
i_couldn't decide between_the augergine curry
or a_dosa
and_i plumped for the_latter
lucky for_me
my_friend_ordered the_aubergine curry perfect
i_like a_for deal
ok so_maybe she got to_eat a_little_bit
we_also checked out_the parotta bread
mainly because we_didn't know what_it_was
and_had_a couple_of starters
spinach_and paneer dumping for_me not_as exciting as_i thought_they would_be
and chicken_pakora
when the_dosa appeared
i_had_the customary reaction of holy moly
it's huge and_full_of potato
and herbs
not strong flavours
but grew on_it as_i munched away
it_came_with some soupy thing
which_was pleasant
and_some dips to support the_dosa
some better_than others
the parotta was_a novelty and_felt deliciously unhealthy
the_most strange part_was the_service
which_was all_over_the place slow to_take orders
and_then we_were pretty much told to hurry up_eating our starter
as our_main was_ready
after rushing through the_starter
we abandoned our remaining poppadum
which_was then shook at_us to_keep eating
it_felt all rather
odd
it_is definitely_not a romantic
nor the_most luxurious meal
but a_week later
i'm missing my dose a_dosa
and_i'd be_happy to_go_back
looking_at other_indian_restaurant menus just makes_me think
hmm
i'd rather go_back_to tanjore
that must_be good
right
as a_curry lover it_is_always nice to_find somewhere which_has a slightly unique spin on
probably
one_of this nations favourite things
tanjore is a_real south_indian restaurant
no standard chicken_tikka_masala or vindaloo here
instead what_is served is a_selection_of rich curries
i_think most contain yoghurt or coconut milk
cooked_well
with_an emphasis on vegetarian_options and fish
ok
that_is_the good
the_bad is_that the_service_is just uneven
never unpleasant but perhaps not_that interested or simply not aware_of where people_are in_their meals
others_have noted this too
so_i don't_feel i_need_to push the issue
however it_is_a shame
all in_all tanjore offers good_and different curry and_it_is byob establishment
so i_will_be_back
they_just need_to sort the_service out a_little
this_place_is fantastic
i_was_not expecting to_find delicious_indian_food
a byo at_that
while on vacation in scotland
but_i'm so_happy we_did
the_food_was_delicious and unlike any_other indian_food_i've_had_in the_states
as_we mostly have northern indian_cuisine
i_love_the intricate use of_spices_and coconut milk as opposed_to heavy creams as_is common with northern indian_cuisine
the_prices_were very_reasonable and_the_service_was absolutely lovely
if this_place were near me_in the_states i'd_be bringing all my_friends there
the_food_was_excellent
i_agree_with the_other_reviews on_this
my concern is cleanliness the_waiter dropped utensils on_the_floor
then picked them up_and continued setting tables
he sneezed on_the dishes
not ours i_would_have sent it_back
he noticed a_piece_of gunge on_my wife's plate_and scraped it_off with_his fingernail
we_did get_a clean plate
the toilets were very_clean_and neither_of us got sick but_we probably_would not go_back until the_health inspector does a thorough review of_this_place
too_bad as_i stated
the_food_was_excellent
we summed it_up
go
go now before_they get_that star and_can charge much
much_more for_what is_by_far and away the_best_indian_food we've ever_had
book now
had_been given some recommendations to_try_this restaurant
it turned_out_to be_a_great decision
the_food_was absolutely_amazing and has_to_be some_of_the_best_indian food_i've_ever_had
the_service_was_excellent and_really couldn't fault a thing_about the_whole night
highly_recommended the lobster was the_real highlight
a_little_more expensive than your average indian_restaurant but_then it's_not your average_indian
i_was lucky enough to_get_the opportunity_to come_here_for a business lunch
and_well let's say my work rate declined in_the afternoon with a_belly full_of such delicious_food
it's_the fine_dining posh sister of_the famous kushi's restaurant
we_arrived and_the_atmosphere_is tranquil and calm
a morning rushing around was soon forgotten as the_ambiance worked it's magic on_me
we plumped for_the taster menu_and started_with an unusual chicken salad wrapped in lettuce leaves with grated testy green apple on top
this set_the scene for an_amazing menu of_tasty
unique indian_dishes
having lived_in singapore for two_years i've been spoilt with_some fantastic_indian dining experiences
but_this has_to_be said was the_most unique
flavorful taste sensation i've_had
as it_was_a business lunch we_didn't try the_wine selection which looked good
but we_did try some_of_the mocktails which really stood out
i_had_a watermelon and_fresh ginger mix which really went_well together and_perfectly balanced the_food
the_service_was really_friendly and we_had_some amusing banter
without_it being over the_top
i_would very
very highly_recommend_this if you're looking_for somewhere different at_that end_of town
they_also_have_a newly opened bar area which is_a_nice laid back area to_enjoy a refreshment or_two
i'll definitely be_back_for_more than one visit
we_only went_for cocktails
but_what lovely cocktails they_were
so_many original creations featuring fresh fruit
passion fruit
pomegranate
pineapple
raspberry
and_other flourishes
and_if_you didn't fancy the_special cocktails on_the_menu
the bartenders were happy_to make_you anything you desired
and_they made_it very_well
i_was_pleasantly_surprised
when you_think indian_restaurant
probably the_last thought_that comes_to mind is_amazing cocktail bar
but mithas isn't just your average_indian
while they_do_have an outstanding restaurant
sadly which i_have_yet_to try
they_have also extended their venture and a_few_months previously opened a_truly excellent wine_and cocktail bar
entering mithas is_like entering a_very swish five_star hotel and_with_a quick turn to_the right the_bar sits
loads_of dark work and_a nicely proportioned seating_area with about high seats at the_actual bar itself
the_wine and cocktail menu_is large
but_not so large that_it's difficult_to decide on what_you_want
being on_a cocktail quest we of_course all immediately focused on_the two pages of speciality cocktails to decide our_drinks
my_first was_called devil's candy a_delicious mixture_of gin muddled with pomegranate and_mint
a_touch of lemon
and topped up_with ginger beer
but_the art of_the drink was_more_than just liquid mixed together
my_drink was topped with incredibly garnish and_a spray of gold dust
it actually looked_like christmas in_a glass
my_second drink of_the_night was_a classy martini called the absolut passion
a martini glass dipped in sugar arrived with_a mixture_of vodka with_fresh strawberry puree
fresh passion fruit
and a_sweet touch of gomme syrup
on first sip i_was_pretty much in_love
this may have_been_a boozy drink
but_it went down an absolute treat
i_definitely would_have ordered another if_it hadn't been_a school night
in_addition_to the gorgeous cocktails
the_staff at mithas are incredibly lovely
very_very accomodating and_welcoming
the_bartender was_an absolute gem mixing up loads_of cocktails for_our group_and the_wait_staff even brought_out_a delicious salad with tender_chicken for_us_to enjoy while_we drank
definitely the_kind_of treatment that you_want at such_a lovely place
the only_negative i_can_see for mithas wine_and cocktail bar_is the_price
cocktails started at_about which_is_what most_people would expect_to_pay on george street
but_not down in leith
however
i_felt_like the_quality_of_the cocktails definitely justified the_price and_i_would happily pop back_here for_a_few pre or post dinner_at one_of_the many restaurants at_the shore
did_i come_here_for indian_food
no
i_came for cocktails
but_i shall return for_an_indian feast
as part_of_the yelp cocktail quest
headed up by_the cocktail queen robyn z
we_were_in leith and ready to_get_our cocktail on
our original plan of bond no was dropped when blythe suggested mithas one_of_the_best_indian restaurants_in_edinburgh
who recently opened a_new cocktail bar
my curiosity was peaked
and_what cocktails they_were
it's_a_small bar area
and_it_was empty on_a wednesday night
they mixed me_a margarita tout de suite
and it_was_perfect
it's_hard_to do_a margarita above and beyond the_usual excellent
but_it's easy_to_get it wrong
and_i find its a_good way to_judge a_place on_its skills
this was_a_great margi
so_i knew we_were_in good mixologist hands
the rakput
was_a muddled raspberry and vodka affair
that_was garnished with a_whole chilli and also_had chilli in_the cocktail
you_could really taste it
in_an pleasant way
and_not chilli syrup or 'essenence of'
but real chilli
by the_third cocktail i'd gotten into_a very interesting discussion with julie g on japanese feminism and_the_rest of_the_night is_a blur
the cocktails were that_good
i_have heard only good_things about_the_food
and given its mainly a_restaurant and_i've yet to_try_their food
i_can't give_it stars just yet
but_i will_return to_try_it all
and_will leave time to_visit the cocktail bar first before my_meal too
right
i've been back_to_try the_food_and just wow
definite stars from_me
jenny l and_i arranged a girl date so_we_could dine and drink_and belatedly celebrate her new job and_what better place_the mithas
from the_moment we_walked_in til the_moment we_left the_service_was impeccable and_the_staff so friendly_and_helpful
i_love_the design of_this_place
dark work with splashed of bright colours
the_tables are set a_good distance apart so_you don't_feel like you_are on_top_of the_people dining next_to you but_there_is still a_good atmosphere_and buzz from_the room
the_menu_is well laid out
with_a_few set menu tasting menu options_and also an a_la_carte_menu to_choose_from
we_went a_la_carte ordering_the scallops and crab cakes for_starters and_a lamb_curry and roasted duck dish_for mains
i apologise as the_names_of all these_dishes is long forgotten
thankfully not the_taste though
before our starters arrived we_were treated to a_little mug of_spicy tomato_soup that was_delicious_and warm if a_wee bit_on_the spicer side for_me
starters arrived_in good_time and_the scallops came_in their shells with_a delightful sauce and_the crab cakes with_a nicely dressed side salad
we spilt everything and_i_have_to_say it_was_all delicious
the crab cakes especially as they_were full_of crab and really_well blended spices_that were_both warming while also giving a_slight kick at_the_end
they_were washed down well_with our cocktails
mains arrived next and were_just outstandingly good
i've_eaten a_lot_of curries
but these_were just_so above anything i'd tried before
the_spices were_well blended and_so flavourful the duck and_lamb was_super tender_and everything just made my_mouth happy with_a palate of_spice
warmth
and general deliciousness
although_we were getting full
we_did struggle to_eat the majority of_the_meal because neither_of us wanted_it to_go_to waste
also we managed_to squeeze in dessert
jenny the poached pear and me_the seasonal dessert of warm chocolate cake with liquid centre
all_delicious with cinnamon and hazelnut ice creams
overall an incredibly amazing meal
the_prices_are a_bit higher than you'd pay for_a normal indian
but well_worth_it
i cant' wait to_go_back
i'm wavering between a_and a_star really in_this case
there_isn't much in_it
by_the_time i stop writing you_will know which way i_went
i've been curious to_try mithas for_a_while it's definitely_going for_the fine_dining edge and_service_is efficient
brisk and detailed
we
unfortunately
didn't dress for_the occasion
but thankfully were_not turfed out_for such insolence
now
this_review
being during the_world cup
will_be_a tale of_two halves
first half food
one of_these days i'll return_for the tasting menu
i_think_that will_be fun times
first
we_were presented with a_drink passionfruit and pomegranate i_think
the_waitress forgot_to tell us
and_we forgot_to ask
it_was lovely
nonetheless
it_came_with a_selection_of dips that could_be matched with_our starters tomato and beetroot
spiced tomato chutney etc
they looked lovely
but i_was_so engrossed in the_starter
i clean forgot_to try_them
for_starters
we split the_vegetarian platter it_was_a_little awkward
as everything came out_in 's
but_there_was three of_us
but
apart from_that
the_food_itself
as my_fellow diner commented
was_a really refreshing change
with nary a deep_fried dish in sight
fried paneer with_a spicy edge
a cake made_of yam
for_me
too soggy
spinach cake stuffed_with figs
my_favourite
and mushrooms
also stuffed_and spiced
too spicy_for_me
next up
mains
chicken for_the silent reviewer
south_indian prawn curry_for the divine ms m and for_myself
baby aubergines
again
the_aubergine was_a_little_too spicy_for_me
and_my tastebuds died in a_spice overload
but_the prawn curry was_lovely
creamy
and formed a_tasty contrast to_my dish
we_also_had_the bread basket
i've_had better naan elsewhere
but_they_were ok
and pilau_rice
the_portion_sizes were good_as_well not excessive
nor too small
that we_all finished up satisfied
dishes_were not_greasy either
another win for mithas
overall food was_lovely
well_cooked
and_cooked fresh
so you_do have_to_wait
and_nicely presented
next_time i'll have_to_ask to tone down the_spice to_make_it more palatable for_me
and_that stars will_go up_to
second half drinks
alright
so_we_had had a_couple_of wines before entering
and_if we_hadn't
we probably would_have_been much_more behaved on_the drinks front
but boy
i'm glad_that our inhibitions had_been cast aside
because we_made the_right choice
even_if my_head did hurt a_little this morning
the divine ms m and_i both opted_for_the cocktail sampling menu
poor
poor sober silent reviewer was_our designated driver
this menu more_than matched the_food menu
five cocktails for twenty pounds is_an absolute steal as_well
especially at_this level_of quality
starting out_with_a watermelon and vodka aperitif
ginger
crushed watermelon and vodka
was_a winning start
every flavour was nicely balanced and outrageously good
it_was then_i met the love of_my lift that evening
a girl can_have many
many loves of_course
hazelnut and sparkling wine just hands down phenomenal i_would drink that forever
this_was swiftly followed up_with_a jack daniels martini from_the coolness of watermelon and sweetness of hazelnut
it_was_a shock to_the tastebuds
but a_good_one the abrasiveness of_the whisky tempered by_the mixologist
involving pineapple
to_a much_more smooth level
then onto_the red salute a fruitier
sweeter number with lychee that had_been the_original draw for_me but actually more forgettable than some_of it's predecessors
finally
a guilty pleasure a_creamy frothy number with jasmine tea that_just tasted like_a boozy chai_tea
a dreamy way_to draw our_way to_a close and for_us_to pour ourselves out_and into_the car home
the cocktail tasting menu_was technically supposed_to be_served at_the_bar with bar snacks but we_didn't notice that when_we_ordered
and_got it anyway
as the_waitress first warned us you_will_have shots and ml of sparkling wine
so please me hearties
do_not drink this menu_and think to_drive
summary
food stars
but more_like
going_on
cocktails
for_me were the_best cocktails i_have_ever tasted
the remaining were worthy runners up
stars
service
stars
nice even_when the_restaurant_was closing up and_we_were the_only_ones left
alright you_got me this_is stars of deliciousness
a_fantastic way to_spend a_saturday_night
empress of_india is far and away the_best_indian_food_in k w
i_have_tried a_number_of other_places around here and_they don't_come close
i've grown up eating_indian_food on_a_regular_basis
including going_to india for_it
and believe_me
this_is as close as you'll get_to the_real deal in k w
often times people_are daunted by_the sheer number_of things_on an_indian menu
and this_restaurant_is no_exception
to_get you started
i_recommend trying their veg pakoras
tandoori_chicken
amritsari fish
dal_makhani
garlic_naan_and chana
that's a_fair bit_of food across_the board to_get you going
the_atmosphere_is_nice and cozy
it gives the_feeling of_a traditionally cooked meal
rather than_a pre packaged commercialized food_experience
now
i_know lots_of people who try_indian_food for_the_first_time are worried about spice
and_not to_worry
the_food_here_is not too_hot
i_have brought many_people here who_are
noobs
in the_indian_food world and_they absolutely_loved it
and_left with_their tongues intact
and_their bellies full
this_restaurant_is excellent if_you_want great_indian_food whether you_want_to dine in_the_restaurant or take_it back_to your dorm
it_is a_little_pricey for students
but the_quality_is well_worth_the slightly higher expense in_my_opinion
i_have_only ever_tried their vegetarian curries
however these have_all been excellent
their paneer tastes light_and fresh
and_their chickpea masala is_delicious
with just_the_right_amount_of spice
they_have_an excellent selection_of tame to hot curries
though you're not_going_to find anything too intensely spicy
if you dine in_the_restaurant you_will_get complimentary papadum with_two tasty chutneys
the_servers_are very_helpful and_polite
i'm very_happy that_they seem_to_have replaced whoever was constantly burning the_naan
kids took_me for father's day
yummy stuff
i_normally do_not like to_eat fish except sushi
but_i'd go_back in_a heartbeat for_the amritsari fish
fresh halibut marinated_in garlic ginger paste
lemon juice
special indian_spices and deep_fried garnished with salad_and lemon
also_had_the veggie pakora
samosa
naan and_the_tandoori platter
other mains were the_chicken_korma
lamb_vindaloo_and dahl
while_i wasn't wild about the_tandoori platter
everything_else_was excellent
especially the_lamb_vindaloo
excellent value_and capable
attentive_service
can't_wait for my_next_visit
mattar_paneer is my_go_to dish at_indian_restaurants and empress of_india makes_it pretty well
i've tried_the channa_masala
vegetable_korma and_the vegetable_samosas and_all are_quite good
it's_hard_to find good_indian_food_in waterloo
most_places i've tried in_the_area have fairly tasteless and watery food
empress of_india is_not like_that
if_you're_a student
flash your card and they'll take off
i learned this after the_guy ringing up my_order saw my watcard in_my wallet haha
this_is_a true little_gem
i_am perhaps_the world's greatest critics of_indian nepalese restaurants as_i know_what_i like and_they often don't live up_to my standards
i've got my_favourite restaurants that_i frequent and_i do often try others but of_the_time i leave disappointed
i'm very_happy to_say_that when_i went_to_the gurkha cafe this_was_the other
i_was anything but disappointed
the_interior of_this_place is_really cool
it_feels_like you're_in a_little hut as it_has open wooden beams all_over_the ceiling
i_felt as thought i'd taken a plane east by just stepping through the_door
the_interior really does set_the tone and_makes a_lovely change_from other restaurants_in_edinburgh
i_saw someone at_the_table next_to me drinking a nepalese gurkha beer so_i_decided when_in rome
it_was not_a_bad beer_and went_well with_the_food but_for
for mls it_wasn't so cheap
worth_it for_the label though
i_went_for_the mo mo cha nepalese chicken dumplings to_start and you_could choose this either steamed or fried
i_went_for steamed and_was so_glad that_i_did as_they were_delicious
i_was_a_bit apprehensive but_they_were very_tasty
they_were crescent moon shaped and_there_were lots_of them i'm_sure i_had at least and was_full after the_starter alone as_they certainly didn't scrimp on the_portion_sizes
what made this_dish though was_the sauce_that accompanied it
i_couldn't work out_what was_in it_and_it didn't say on_the_menu but_this_was a_tasty little number
i_want_to say_it_was mustard as that's_what it_looked_like but i_hate the_stuff so know_it certainly wasn't_that
no matter_what was in_it
it_was divine and_just pushed this_dish over_the edge and into_the exquisite category
my_companion had_the_chicken satay to_start_with
this wasn't the_usual asian chicken satay that you'd normally expect as this_was with_a nepalese twist
the_size_of this_dish could_have easily passed for a_main course
there_were huge chunks_of_chicken under a_rich
tomato barbeque style sauce
as_i said
not_like the_usual peanut style satay but_still_good
not_as_good_as my dumplings though top tip
another good_thing about_this_place
to_add to_the huge list
is you_can specify how mild or how hot you'd like your_meal to_be so the_dishes really are made to_your specific requirements
for_main course i_ordered_the chicken_korma
when_ordering in_fact
i asked_the_waiter what_he recommended_by telling him what_i liked
i_know a_lot_of_people think
'boring old korma' but this_restaurant gave this_dish a_new lease of life
the tastes and flavours in this_dish were phenomenal
that's_what i_love about nepalese even more_than indian_restaurants
they_use even_more herbs and_spices to create the_perfect flavours
yummy
again the_portion_sizes were very_generous but_it_was so_tasty that i_couldn't stop_eating until i'd finished it_all
my_fellow diner had_the_chicken garlic_and chilli if_i remember correctly
it_came_out still cooking on_a hot plate and_the colours of_the_dish made_for great presentation
the_quantity as_well as quality_of this_dish was unbelievable
we_could_have easily shared this alone without starters and_still left full i'm_sure
she only managed a quarter of_it as_it_was
as_i said above
although this_dish is made_with chilli she asked_for_it to_be mild_and it suited her just perfectly
we_ordered rice_and_a peshwari nan to_go_with the main_courses
the_nan_was lovely
lighter than_most nans which_was a_good_thing considering the_amount_of_food and_it_came in a_basket cut into pizza style slices
this_place really does have_it all you_can't get_a more central location
the_highest of_quality food_with flavours bursting in_every mouthful
good friendly_service and a_different yet cool interior
it's a_winner
as if_you_can't tell already
i_love_this_place
take whatever i've written and imagine i_love_it more then you'll be getting a_bit closer_to understanding how_much i_enjoyed this meal and_now love this_restaurant
honestly
the_only_thing left to_say is try_it for_yourself
i'm_sure you won't_be_disappointed and if_you_are then you_can always take_the left_overs away for_me
no_complaints friendly_staff
unforgettable food
the flavours are_so deep and intense
i_love_it
go_for_the lunch deal really good_value
the_first_time round i_got_the dal_makhani
which_was_delicious
and the_second_time i_got_the rajma aloo which_was equally good
i_wish_i_could go_back but i_don't_know when i'll be in_edinburgh again
we_started with_chicken momo
they_were_good
a_bit like_a curried ravioli
the_sauce tasted a_bit like_a spicy tomato pasta sauce
making_it seem even more_like_a twisted italian dish
they_were_good
none the_less
i_got my bhuteko khasi
lamb
as hot
and it_was_a_bit spicy_but_not nearly what_i expected
the_taste_was great_for this_dish
we_also_had_the rasilo chicken_which
at medium_spice
was_not hot at_all
i preferred my lamb
hungry
want_to leave edinburgh_and go_to_a hotel for_dinner in kathmandu
in gurka cafe you_will think_you have arrived
quality service
homemade authentic nepalese_food
italian but better with chinese influence
they guy cant do enough_for you
i_think next_time_i go i_will ask_for_a camel steak just to_see_if they manage to_find one
they managed everything else when_i took a_group_of fifteen crazy americans there
a credit to_your nation and_an asset to_edinburgh
the_staff_were great and_didn't push too hard in that_way that indian_restaurants sometimes do to_get you to_buy more_food
i_found_the lamb achari not spicy_enough
even at hot level
the_vegetable_korma was_a_tad sweet
but_all overall good
they're great_for large late parties
even ones with an_extra people who unexpectedly turned u after the_rest
our_group of had_one of_the_best meals here
and i_think_it's safe to_say_the best meal we_had during_our stay in_edinburgh
the_staff_were absolutely delightful and_only added_to the_experience
this_would_be_a regular place for_me if_i_lived nearby
trying to_find_a meal late at_night
we ducked in_here and_got one_of_the best meals of our_trip
not perfect but pretty damn close
excellent spice
decent heat when_ordering
hot
nice service
funky atmosphere
i've_never_had nepalese but i've_had scads of_indian
it_was_delicious
check your bill
they charged use for_a pickle tray we said_no to
it's only_a
but_still
i'm glad_i caught it and_they fixed it no problem
khushi's has recently moved_here from victoria street
and it's_easy_to see why it's doing so_well
yes
it's true that edinburgh has more_than it's fair share of easy on_the pennies indian_restaurants to_choose_from
but_this_place definitely ranks among_the better ones
even just from walking past the_door
the_smell alone makes_you hungry
it mainly caters for groups of students it's_the obvious choice_for sports teams on_their nights out or birthday meals
largely because they_don't charge any corkage for bringing your_own wine_and beer
spirits aren't allowed
if_you're_not boozing
then you_have_to try_their home_made fruit juice creations
i_went_for_the cucumber
mint_and rock salt
and although_it sounds more_than a_little_bit weird it_was_actually really_tasty
the_carrot and orange was_a close second place
the starters will set you back each
and_you could_do a_lot worse than_the sunhari jhinga
king prawns fried in spiced batter
crispy_and amazing
the_mains range from
although they're not hugely imaginative all_the predictable dishes you'd_expect to_find on_the_menu in an_indian_place
being predictable
however
doesn't stop them from being delicious
i_have a_bit_of_a grudge against khushi's in_its old incarnation of victoria street a kitchen fire burnt down one_of_my favourate bars next door
so grr
anyway
me_and a_party_of others turned up_to khishi's to_celebrate with a_curry and_a_few drinks with_the bring_your_own bottle policy that_they_have at khushi's
the_restaurant_is suprisingly big
being able to easily cater_to such_a huge group and_it_is really modern looking inside
which_is a_nice_change to_other_indian_restaurants i_have_been in
the_staff_were incredably friendly
helpful_and just generally nice as_well as_being excellently efficient and_fast as we_ordered from_our menu's
which_had a_large selection_of traditional and_modern indian_dishes
when_our food_arrived i_was over joyed it_tasted fabulous and_the_portions_were the_perfect size for_me
sides such_as rice_and_naan were also_great
if a_bit small_and stingy
anyway
khushis's has more_than made_up_for burning down that bar by providing great_food
good atmosphere_and an_excellent night overall
after_a dramatic burn down of_this large restaurant_on victoria street
they reopened a smaller version quite close_to_the university central campus
it's still managed_to keep its_good quality_indian_food
i_am_a particular fan_of_the chicken bryanny and added_to this it there_is_a byob policy with_no cork free
on rugby nights or weekend nights i_would_suggest you book in_advance
also don't give in to_the sometimes pushy waiters who want you to_order more_than you_want or make choices too fast
also_the low ceilings make_it quite noisy so sit_in the lower room if_you_get a_chance
this_is yet another four star_because kushi's is_pretty_good
the_fact_that it_has_a byob policy makes_it ideal for big group meals prior_to nights out
i_came_here_with a_large_group of_friends once last year on_a_friday evening and_the_place_was heaving with_both floors full_and roaring noise
the_service_was_pretty slow because_of this and_we_were waiting_for at least minutes_for_our main_courses to_arrive
i_opted_for_the lamb bhuna with_rice_and_a plain_naan which_was_delicious and the_portion_was ample for_a night on_the tiles
my_friend_ordered the_tandoori_chicken which just_about blew her head off_with the_heat of_the chillies
most_of_their mains cost about and_the sides are_all pretty well_priced
making_it a relatively cheap evening out
khushi's offers great_food in_a lively
comfortable atmosphere which_is ideal for a_fun
tasty group meal
deep flavour
not_at_all greasy
just fanastic food
very_nice good_service
patient
even with_a_group_of knackered drunken but_not rowdy designers
inexpensive
and byo
what's not_to like
khushi's has_been serving indian_food to_edinburgh residents since
so_is woven in to_the fabric of the_city
this_new place sticks to_their tried
tested and trusted formula
overall
we_said
this_isn't a new_restaurant at_all
it's the_same old khushi's
if_you_like it
and loads_of people do
you're_going_to be delighted with this_new outlet
for_me it's ordinary and_doesn't provide anything fresh
it's so_well established in_the edinburgh dining consciousness that_i'm confident it_will continue to_be_a successful business in_its new_location
i_can't see me paying a_repeat visit anytime soon
though
as_it lacks any spark to raise it above being merely ok
despite living_in edinburgh for almost years
i_hadn't made_it to any_of_the infamous khushi restaurants so decided_to pay a_visit for_my birthday night_out
i_had_a booking for_people
for_a two hour slot
and was_quite surprised_at just how_busy it_was for a_week night between christmas and new years
the khushi reputation clearly drives a_great trade
having made an
executive
decision to_dine from_the christmas set menu
pp
minimising the agonies of making_a selection from_the vast a_la_carte and_the squabbles over
who_had what
when_it came_to paying the_bill
i_was_very_impressed with_the selection
and quantity
of_the offering
a pre starter of pickles and popadoms kept us going while we_waited_for the_last few of_the party to_arrive
followed by a_variety_of starters including the_typical chicken_tikka
onion bhajii and pakora
the_main_course selection included_a tender lamb jalfrezi
tasty fish_curry and chicken_korma
served_with rice_and_naan
there_was something to_cater for the_taste_of everyone
it_was_a perfect way_to_try a_selection_of different_dishes
the food_was_served buffet_style and_there_was plenty to_go around
i'd_be surprised if anyone could_have managed dessert after such_a feast
coupled with_the byob offering with_no corkage charge
the_night was_a success
great value_for_money
my_only niggle would_be_the constant reminder from_the waiting staff of_the_two hour booking slot
not_only to_me but_also to some_of_my guests which i_felt added an unnecessary sense_of urgency to the_experience
will definately visit_again to_dine from_the a_la_carte_menu
bah
you_know when_you keep giving somewhere just another_chance because_it used_to_be good
well
i_think last_night was the_night i_gave up
i_used_to love khushi's in victoria street
it_was_a dramatic building
and i_had_some great_food there
then_it burnt down
and_they moved_to a_fairly boring cellar under_the pear tree and i_don't_know
seemed_to lose their way
sauces_were boring and_tasted 'out of_a jar'
and worse
the_staff would positively force feed you_to get_you out fast
but_i reasoned to myself that_i_had gone during_the festival and_at christmas
and nowhere is_at its best when_it's so busy
finally
khushi has its new home
in antigua place_at the_top_of leith walk
it's taken over a_big space that used_to_be massimo's
i_miss massimo's
and from the_outside it_looks bright_and cheerful and_the place_to_be
so last_night i_called and_asked_for a_reservation for_four
they_had_a table
though we'd have_to_be out in_minutes
that seemed fair
we_just wanted a_quick meal
from the_second we_arrived
though
it_all went wrong
we_were shown into_a bare 'overspill' room off_to the_side
harassed to_order fast
and_then the unsmiling waiter announced that he'd 'bring your starters and mains at the_same_time
because_you have_to_be out soon'
charming
and_so he_did
slapped everything down_and off he went
to practise his lack_of social skills on someone else
the food_was_okay
i_suppose fish pakora were_tasty
the_veg pakora a bit_dry for_my_liking
my tandoori monkfish i've_had it_before there and_loved_it
but last_night it_was_a_bit overcooked
and
maybe not actually monkfish
the_texture just wasn't quite right so_i_was suspicious
anyway
we_ate
we_got full
mostly it_was basic british indian_food_in over creamy sauces
and_we_were finished long before the_time they_were due_to throw us_out
there_are too_many good restaurants_in_edinburgh to_have_to put up_with actively rude service
i've_had enough
and won't be_back
q
what did_the inflatable headmaster say to_the inflatable student in_the inflatable school
a
you've let me down
you've let_the school down_and you've let yourself down
that's how_i feel about_my visit_to khushi's
what a_disappointment
i_really_liked_the old khushi's on victoria st
unless i'm looking back_with rose tinted taste_buds
certainly the_building was beautiful and lent the_whole experience a degree of elegance
well
at least as_much elegance as_you_can muster while staggering up_the stairs clutching your plastic bag overflowing with byob contributions
i_have fond memories of_the_food there_but it_seems a_long_time now since that_place burned down
what's happening with_that space
anyway
i_went once to_their temporary location where the_food_was bad and_the_service worse
i_wasn't sure_if i_wanted_to go_back but_since they_opened their new_restaurant at the_top_of leith walk
it_looked more stylish and back_to_the original vibe
i_was sad_to see massimo close down though
as i_was_impressed both_times i_went_there
i_guess i_should_have gone more often
but_it's_a funny location at_the top_of_the walk
kind of on_the_way somewhere but neither here nor there
intermediate but_not central
as_we say in_the geography biz
it works for_the cheap_and crappy indian
and_other sub continental
and italian places there who grab the pre theatre cheapskates but_it's_not an easy location to_make_a go of_a high_quality
and matching price
establishment
so
the_new place_looks nice from the_outside
but inside it_feels a_bit more_like_a pile 'em high and sell 'em cheap kind of_place
and_that's how_they treat you
see gillian's review_for more detail
we knew when_we booked that_we only_had minutes
which_was fine
but they_really rushed us_and not_in_a friendly way
it_was_just rude
and_he told_us the starters would_come with the_mains because_we had_to_be out
didn't ask_us
or make_it friendly or_anything
come_on
how long does it take to_cook
serve and_eat a_few pakora
as_it turned_out
we_finished with_plenty_of time_to spare
the food_was_decent
quite reliable quality but_nothing out_of_the ordinary
and continued rude service throughout_the_meal
q
there_are_so many good_indian
bangladeshi
etc
restaurants_in_edinburgh
why would we go_back_to a_place like_this
a
i_think you already know_the answer
i_was_very dubious about trying khushis again
i used_to_be_a dedicated follower and must_have gone at least every couple_of months without fail for_years
until the_old restaurant opened on victoria street that_is and the_quality_of_the_food as_well as service just_went straight down_the hill
the_last_time_i went i_had_a disastrous meal involving raw prawns and_a chicken bone which although_the head chef himself came_out_to see_what was going_on as he_could see_that we_were_not happy
instead_of helping turn out experience round for_the better he_just decided_to conceal the evidence and walk_away without so_much as_an apology
needless to_say_i never_went back
however
i_don't hold too_much of_a grudge and_am willing to_give out second chances so_when the new_restaurant opened on antigua street i pondered over whether to_try_it or_not
i_have_to_say though
i'm definitely glad_i_did
although_i was nervous when walking through the_door the friendly_and_attentive staff put me_at ease quickly
this setting is_lovely
although the_other one was_really swanky antigua street restaurant_has still managed_to keep that element alive but_with a_more cosy atmosphere rather than_the cold_and open feel the_old place_had
the_ceiling is full_of glass lanterns which fill the_place with colour and sparkle
that's_not the_only colourful thing about_the_place though
the_new and improved menu is_amazing they_have far more fish courses than i_remember and_the baltic curries come_in a clay pot with an_indian bread lid which look delightful
the_quality_is back up_to scratch and_the_prices not half bad either for curries ranging_from
but lets not forget about the_deal breaker here it_is bring_your_own bottle and_one_of the_only b
y
o
b
s in_edinburgh that_doesn't charge corkage
your purse will thank_you so go_for_it
in yet another incarnation khushi's is_now on_the site of what_was previously an italian called massimo's whilst the burnt out branch on victoria street is_on_the market
having only ever_eaten in_the defunct one once about years_ago comparisons are probably pointless but one_thing that_did strike me was_that_the range_of dishes available seems_to be smaller nowadays
i imagine you_could get_a vindaloo if you asked_for one but_that and a_few_other types_of curry don't feature on_the_menu it_seems so you_might want_to try elsewhere if in_search_of something particularly hot
possibly that's_a sign_of authenticity
either way the party_of i_was_in with on saturday past had no_complaints about_our respective dishes
the knowledgeable speedy service or_the highly sensible policy of not charging for corkage
not maybe_the place_to_go_for a_quiet and intimate tete a tete but_you could_do a_lot worse in most_other aspects
the_food_was_excellent but_the_service_was abrupt and rushed
could_have spoiled what_was a brilliant evening with_friends
was recommended to_this_place by my_friends who_are actually from_india
i_expected authenticity and_wasn't let down in_the_food department
the_place_is dimly lit and nicely_decorated to reflect its heritage
which reminds me
i_really must find chandeliers similar_to the_ones found_in khushi
they_are_very pretty
the_portions_are small
which_makes the_prices appear slightly steep
the_food
we_had naan_and lamb_biryani
tastes pretty_decent
but my_friends didn't enjoy the_service and_the_staff as_they put_on too_much of_a
show
i_thought_it_was manageable and_let that slide
all in_all
if_you_have the_right company and_are craving_for_indian_food
this place_is_pretty ok
okay overall nasty burnt garlic in sag paneer
big points off
but naan_was_good
mango_lassi_was great
the_sign on the_door about beer wine was confusing i_thought_it meant they_had only beer wine_and no cocktails
but_it actually means there_is no alcohol you_can bring_your_own
but_only beer_and_wine
the_decor_is_very nice
i've eat_a grat fish
fresh
a_good curry

whenever_i walk past this_restaurant
it_is_always packed
i_have always wondered why
now_i know
it_was_a friday_evening and_my_friend suggested we_have dinner_here
we_were offered_a
booking and_the_restaurant was_already full when_i_arrived
a waiter_asked if_we_wanted poppadoms to_start_with
sure why_not
they_were accompanied with dips
mango_chutney and a_spicy onion dip
real kick_to it
i_had_a mixed_grill for my_main course
it_is_a mixed platter of_chicken_tikka
prawn
lamb chop and seekh kebab
the_chicken_tikka_was my_favourite i_didn't_know chicken can_be so melt in_the mouth stuff
the platter came_with_a simple chickpea salad_and we_shared a naan_bread
the_service at_times felt a_bit rushed
i'm not_sure if_this_is because they_really are_so popular
e
g
a_couple could_not get_a_table as_they had_no reservation
and_it_was_a friday
howerver the_food_was nice
khushi's has_a byob policy and_no corkage charge which possibly is_another factor to_their popularity
lamb kahrahi was_amazing
very_busy night during hogmanay week yet we_got seated quicker than originally stated
garlic_naan_was excellent
while they_don't serve alcohol they_do allow byob and_will supply glasses
visiting from california we_came across khushi's as_we wandered around the_city
the_pakoras were_great and flavorful_but the_three veggie mains we_had were spicy
hot
but_otherwise bland
the_service_was inconsistent and impatient
it's_a bustling place
we_asked_for advice from the_waiter on the_size_of the_portions yet still ended_up_with too_much_food
perhaps it_is popular because_they let_you byob at no charge
so if_i_lived here i_might give_it another try but_i_would imagine there_are_better options for_indian_food
i'm telling you
restaurants_in hotel lobbies are totally underrated
don't believe_me

this_is_the third restaurant_in_the tandoori_times family
i_haven't_been to_the_other locations
but based_on_the reviews for_those establishments
tandoori_times ranks right_up there
admittedly
the_place_was deserted last_night
but_i'm told it's hopping on fridays and saturdays when they_bring in belly_dancing and hookah
the_decor_is completely new
the holiday inn has also been recently renovated
it's comfortable
spacious and_has_a modern feel
the_manager whose name escapes me_at the_moment was_also our_server
she_is pleasant
funny and her presence alone will guarantee my return
any server that_is willing to engage in friendly banter is_okay in_my_book
lastly
the_food_was_excellent
should i_have said_that first
ha
i_can't_speak intelligently on indian_cuisine
but suffice it to_say_that i_enjoyed it_very_much
and fried cottage_cheese is_now one_of_my major food groups
check_it_out
great and_flavorful food
plus friendly_service
being close_to_my home_and office
i_have_been_to this joint quite a_few_times_and its high time_i put_in good words for_the great_quality of_food_and the_amazing friendly_service that_they provide
i_am_a vegetarian they_do_have many veggie_options
the_ambience_is great
a_cool mix_of modern_and traditional_indian interior
the lunch_menu is_also good_and very_filling
for the_dinner_menu too their servings are_large enough_for two
ask_for spicy_food and they'll make sure its the_way you expected
the staff_is_very_friendly
nargis
freva and sussanna
all are_very lively
they_have_some good collection of wines too
i'd_love to_try_out the_bar some day
i came_by this_restaurant one evening as_i_was having_a craving_for_indian_food and_this_was just a_couple_of miles away from_my home
i_got_the mango_lassi
the_tikka_masala paneer_and paneer battered in_some gravy
i_wish_i_could remember_the_name_of it
here's the breakdown
service_is really quite_good
i_went_in and_took a_couple_of minutes to_pick something out
the_girl at_the hostess' table was_attentive
and whilst waiting multiple people stopped by to_make_sure i_had_been taken_care of
she made_sure to_bring the_mango_lassi out to_me first
as_well
which_was_nice
the_tikka_masala_was delicious
spicy and_with_a depth of_flavor that was_awesome
the_paneer_was chewy
and_could have_been tastier
but_really
why would you_want_to compete with the_sauce
the_fried paneer_was perhaps the_most mediocre of_the punch
as mentioned before
the_paneer by itself was_a_bit unremarkable
and the_spices and_the tangy tamarind dipping sauce it came_in wasn't something to_my preference
not awful
just not_my_favorite
it_was_also a_bit rubbery
but we_all know fried things don't travel well
my biggest gripe is_that
when_i_got home
i found_out they hadn't included rice_with my_order
i'm sorry
but_that_is not_good
i_need rice to_eat with_my tikka_masala
i_could_have made some_of_my own
but_that rather defeats the purpose of take_out
not a_deal breaker
but_definitely left a_slight sour note in_my_mouth
if_you_order take_out make_sure_to request rice
my first_time_here
food_was_great
large_portions at_a good_price
great looking place too
super clean_and nice
had_an outdoor sitting area with misters as_well
service_was_great
so friendly_and_helpful
our servers last time_we fariba and sayed and couldnt have_asked for better staff
i_will_definitely_be_back here
oh_and they_had_a great belly_dancer to_see on_this saturday_night while we_ate
good addition
classy place located at_the holiday inn
the_chicken_makhani and_chicken_tikka_masala were exellent
i_had both_dishes at tandoor and
but_this_place tops all
very well_seasoned
thick rich_and creamy with tasty herbs
meat_was juicy and just_right
rice_was consistent in texture
a gal in braids served us
she_had a foreign accent and_was_very awkward by tring to_be overly friendly
but i'm_sure she_was just trying_to be friendly to_her patrons lol
i_think she_was a n b
but_i realized this_place opened not too_long ago
so she's likely still in training
i asked_her for a_to_go container for_my makhani_and masala
and_she came out_with one of_those sandwich containers
had_to send her back_to fetch a soup container bc the_sauces will leak and_make your car smell like_indian_food for_days
i_would_say i_was_impressed with_the_food
not_quite san jose level
but close
i_would def go_back again if_i drop by hat side_of_town
if_it_were closer_to home_and more affordable
i'd eat_it every_day
d
first_off i_think_that everyone reading this needs to_go show them some love
there_were only_two sets of diners during_lunch the_day we_were_there
i'm_not saying it's perfect but_it_was quite_good
we had_a_groupon which_made it a_great_deal
the_prices_were good_for the_groupon but_otherwise a_bit steep
the_service_was_excellent and_my coconut curry_chicken was_very_good
they_charge you for_rice
which_is_a bummer
but the_rice_was very_flavorful by itself
portions_are adequate and mine was_extremely tasty
my_companion was_not_as impressed_with her food
she got_a vegan dish_which had_to_be remade due_to chicken broth being used
the_server caught it_and had_it remade
however
she asked_for_it to be_on_the spice scale and_i_could eat_it
and i'm_a wuss
my dish_was supposedly a and_i_was fine with_it
so_i_don't understand their scale for hotness
overall it_was_a_good lunch
just_not sure_if it_was_good enough_to go_back_for
wont be_back
ridiculously expensive
bad_service
and tacky decor
despite our_waitress forgetting to_bring drinks until we_asked_for them minutes later
the_food tasted_good
wish the_portion_sizes were bigger
my_boyfriend_and_i ate_here last_week
the_experience from_the start wasn't great
we_were_seated and_no explanation was_given as to_the menus left on_the_table
there_was_a giant menu_that had_no more_than_a dozen or_so items_and a_bunch_of alcoholic beverages
we_were confused and disappointed as we_could really only identify one or_two items
the_waitress
who_is also the_hostess
dropped off additional menus
we_were relieved until we_saw the_prices
yikes
a_bit_more than_we anticipated based on_my previous interpretation of the_number_of money signs
next we_waited
and_waited
and_waited
it took_over minutes_to_get our_drinks and an_order
when_we reminded the_waitress
she seemed offended
as_if it_was_our fault she forgot
then
to_top_it off
we find_out the_two dishes_we_ordered
were exactly the_same
why couldnt someone explain this before we_ordered
one was_just
spicier
the twin dishes_were good
but i_was_a_little peeved that i_just spent close_to for two_of the_same dish
i_probably won't go_back
it's_not that the_food_wasn't good
but i_didn't_feel that we_got good_service
and_i paid way_to much_to not_be treated well
and_in regards to money spent
it_wasn't so_much price per dish
which_i now realize i_was misinformed on
but_it_was the_quantity we_got for_the_price
i_would_definitely not ever come_here with_a bigger group
location i_loved
not_to far away from_where i_live
it's_located right in_the holiday inn parking_lot and is_pretty big inside
as_soon_as_i walked inside for_this friday_night dinner i_noticed the place_was_pretty empty
i_like_the vibe of_the_place
it_feels really clean_and modern with_more of_an upscale feel from other_restaurants in_the_neighborhood
the_waitress_was super_nice_and really gave top_notch service throughout_the night
they_have a_full_bar with_some really_good deals during happy_hour so_i took advantage by trying one_of_the mixed drinks they_had listed
forgot which one sorry
but_it_was yummy
no skimping on_the alcohol either
i_had_the_lamb special for the_evening and_my_husband ordered_the_chicken marsala
we_shared plates and_the_food_was just_ok to_me
i_like things spicy and_felt it_didn't meet what_i liked
as_we_were leaving we_got_a huge surprise
a_belly_dancer came_out_to entertain everyone
loved_the show
location
and_service
amazing_food
i_wasn't so sure about_indian_food
as visiting this_place was_my_first_time at both the_restaurant_and the_food_itself
i_had_the chicken_tikki marsala and it_was_fantastic
i_can't_wait_to_go_back
this_place_is terrific
we_have_been here times_now_and have_tried many_dishes
all are_very_good
they_have_a_great happy_hour from_and belly_dancing on_friday and_saturday nights
if_you_like indian_cuisine or have_never tried_it
give_this_place_a shot
very_good
friendly_service we_had coconut curry prawns
chicken_korma
chicken_tikka_masala
saag with cheese
naan_and_rice with veggies
all_were good
i've_eaten lunch during_the work week two_times
the_first_time was_about weeks_ago
and_then today
both days happened_to be thursdays
the_first_time a_friend from_india
who now lives in us
brought_me here
she's a_vegetarian and_i_asked her where she likes to_go_for indian_food in_the_area
normally she would_make her own lunch
the_second_time
today
i_brought an american friend_who really likes indian_food
similar_to myself
the_food_is_very_good for_an american like_me
i_like flavorable
medium hot spicy foods
i_order
medium
here_on the_spice scale
and_they get_it right for_me
i_could use a_bit_more heat spice
and they_do_have two
hotter
levels than medium
but_i_would rather err on the_side_of caution
i've asked_for medium hot in_the spice dept
but have_been informed they_don't_have that category
their heat scale is_something like no_spice or light weight
medium
hot_and flaming
i made_up those words
i_can't_remember the_names_of foods i've_eaten
they were_delicious
chicken spinach dish
curry_chicken dish
salad
garlic bread naan
rice
lentil_soup it's_all been quite_good
service
decent
first_time_i came it_was less than decent
today it_was decent
one waitress didn't describe or communicate that well
another waitress was_quite friendly_and_helpful at_the start of_the_meal
overall
nothing_to rave or complain about
food
delicious
especially_for what_i imagine is_an americanized indian_food_restaurant
i_don't_know of_any truly authentic_indian_food restaurants in_arizona
several of my_indian friends enjoy_the_food here
and_i've seen large groups of_indian co_workers at other_tables both_times i've_been_here at lunchtime
i'll keep coming_back_for occasional lunches
though it's extremely filling to_eat_here and_then go_back_to work
ambiance
outstanding for_me
if_you_want traditional_indian decor
this probably wouldn't_be the_place_for you
it's_the cleanest
brightest
most modern_indian restaurant_i've ever_been in
very nice_decor that_i happen_to love
it_has not_been busy at_all both_times i've_been_here
which makes_it nice for parking and_for finding a_good table
maybe it's busier in_the evenings or on_weekends
great_atmosphere and_service
very_clean for_an_indian_restaurant
food_was enjoyable
chicken_tikka a bit_dry but_still_good
was not_sure about_this_place at_first due_to location
but_definitely glad i_went_in
just_as delicious_as tandoori ii
but way fancier
we_went_on_a friday_night and_if we_had_been blindfolded in_the way over i_would_have sworn we_were_in scottsdale
the_food_was_awesome
the_building beautiful and the_patio with firepits and heaters and hookahs are a_great addition_to_the ambiance
if_you_have not tried indian_food_before
this_is_the_place to_do_so
the_tikka_masala_and naan_and fragrant rice are_all great beginner dishes
the_only_reason i_am_not giving stars_is the_service_was_pretty damn slow making us miss happy_hour specials
i_will_say though
the_belly_dancer and music were rad but_it made_some of our_party feel awkward as we_didn't know if_we_were supposed_to stop our conversation to_watch and tip
all in_all
this_is_a_great place
an_indian_restaurant inside a holiday inn
if_it_were anything but tandoori_times i might_have thought twice before trying
i've_only ordered takeout
but_the_food_is as you'd_expect if you've eaten_at either of_their other locations
which_is to_say
its_good
the_decor of the_restaurant_is modern_and upscale
but both_times i've picked up takeout the_place_was almost completely empty
if you show up and_this_is the_case
don't_be discouraged
the_food_is_good and_their bar looks fully stocked
this_place_is attached to_a holiday inn but do_not let that fool_you as the_food_is_amazing
the_lamb_vindaloo_and the_garlic_naan_and the_saag gohst are_some of_my_favorites
the complimentary chai_tea tastes a_bit like hot half half
but_what do expect for_free
stars
the_naan
was_great
the_paneer tika_masala was_average
but the_mint_chutney that_had been_sitting so_long that_it fermented and_was carbonated really scared me
lunch_specials range from this_is_not_a lunch_buffet
they_do include hot chai_tea which_is_nice
the_location_is a_bit odd as this_is_the restaurant for_the holiday inn which if_i_were on travel for work i_would_be happy to_find
the_inside is_nice clean_and modern but service_was sub par as_we had_to_ask to_get_our water refilled
luckily i_was_not in_a rush
lunch was oddly slow
with other_tables at_the peak
i_really_like this_place
i_have_been there_so many_times they_know us
i_have_to_say my_favorite things are_on the_happy_hour meny
you_order a_few_things off that_and you_are done
i_always_get_the lamb kabobs
they_have_a pretty nice_selection on beer_and_wine
the_staff_are all very_friendly
they_have_a belly_dancer on_the_weekends which_is fun
if_you_want_to dine on really_good
reasonably_priced indian_food
this is_the_place_to_go
the_dining_room is spacious with contemporary indian themed decor
the_ambiance_is casual and upscale at the_same_time
the_servers_are very_friendly
and_the entrees_are really_tasty
and_if the weather is_good
you_may even want_to dine al fresco at_the spacious patio area
my_husband_and_i love_indian_food
we_have_eaten here times_now
we_have_a restaurant_that we_always go_to and_wanted_to see if_there_was anything better out_there so_after having driven by here_a_few_times we_decided_to stop_in
the_same waiter has served us all_three times_and the_service_has always_been slow
even_when there_are_no other diners
the_food_was really_really_good the_first_time_we went
we_had_the chicken_tikka_masala_and the_sauce_was incredible
extra creamy_and thick
the_next two_times we_went the_food_was_just ok
it_seemed as though the_sauce had_been watered_down a_little and_that_was a_real shame
all in_all i_would wish there_was a_little_more consistency in flavorville so_we_could look_forward_to a_delicious meal everytime
been here_many_times now and_this_place_is delish
we always_get_the chicken_tikka_masala_and then try something new each time we_go
the friday chef special goat is_fantastic as_is_the lamb_curry
an the_garlic_naan is_a_must
most authentic_indian_food outside of_india
i_know
because i've been
don't_let_the idea_of exotic food scare you away
there's something_for everyone here
even vegetarians_and children
try the_paneer
pressed cheese
dishes or samosas choley if_you_don't_like meat
try_the_chicken or paneer makhani if_you_don't_like the_heat
for medium_spicy dishes
the_chicken_tikka_masala_is excellent with_a_side_of rice_and_naan bread
if_you_want_a bite of_something that'll bite you back_with a_really great_flavor
try the_tandoor fish wrap
the key to_eating reasonably is to_go as a_group_of or_more
get rice_and_naan and_a_couple different_items to_share with the_entire table
you_don't_have to_drink alcohol
but_there's a_full service bar at all_of_the tandoori_times locations and_the beer_selection is above_average
this_is_the newest of_the locations and features a_large inside area with an_amazing patio
complete with firepit and hookah
bellydancers join the fun on_friday and_saturday nights
decent value if you crave very_good quality_food
an exotic atmosphere_and an_authentic_indian experience
ok
the bellydancing isn't exactly authentic
but it's_definitely exciting
one_of_my_favorite weekend hangouts
solid out_of
so_good
if_it_was less expensive
i_would_be back more often
almost
not including tip
for app
side
entrees
and_non alcoholic drinks
loved_the grilled shrimp
curry_dishes and_garlic_naan
amazing_food
we were_a_bit skeptical
but_this_place was_really_great
we had_a_groupon
and_our service_was outstanding the naan_was_great
and the_entrees_were spectacular
excellent_service and wonderful_food
i totally suggest trying the_tandoori wings appetizer
they_are so_good_that i daydream about_them
so_i'm finally caving in_and writing a_review about tandoori_times
the_food_is_excellent
but pricey
i_took_a friend_for his birthday and_it cost me just over for_the both_of_us
the_night we_went they_had belly_dancers and_amazing eastern music
the_music_was a_little_bit on_the loud side
i_had_never seen a live belly_dancer and_i_was totally impressed she worked the_room and_it_wasn't at_all uncomfortable
my_friend really_enjoyed her dancing and the_music too
the_only_reason i'm_not giving_this place_stars is_because the_wait_staff really sucked
you_guys really_need to_get_it together in this_area
i_read some_of_the_other reviews_and this_is_a common theme for_you
i_will visit_this_place again
but_if the_wait_staff hasn't improved i_will re rate this_place_and never show up again
the service_was_a_bit_slow even_though_it was sunday_night and_there_was hardly anyone there
they_forgot my_drink
my_first drink took_about mins to appear
the_food_was_good though
naans_were great
so was_my lamb_vindaloo
we_had_the spicy tandoori wings for_appetizers
and_my golfing buddy had the_aloo_gobi which_was great
irish the_service were_more prompt_and i_would_give it four_stars
chicken_tikka_was amazing
food_was_really_good
i_wish there_were more server but i_would_recommend_this_place
i sat for_minutes without being greeted_by_the waiter
no drinks were_offered
i_left after expressing my dissatisfaction to the_hostess
thanks_for the terrible_service
the_sign looks like it_could pass as_a preschool
needless to_say_i was skeptical
after trying_it today i_couldn't say anything bad
the food_was_outstanding and_the_atmosphere_is very_nice
lamb_and coconut_chicken is recommended
called in my_order and_it_was ready to_pick_up when_i_got there
chicken_vindaloo is delish
the_best chicken_tikka_masala
i_love_their garlic_naan_and their_rice with_peas is_delicious
prices are_a_little steep for india but the_quality_is very_good
the_staff_is super_nice which is_always_a pleasure to_walk into
the_restaurant_is located_on the_side_of a hotel
it is_very_nice
brand new_and very comfortable
their is_actually an individual tv at each booth which would_be perfect_for bringing kids or_a spouse you_don't_like
the_tandoori wings appetizer was_ok
probably wouldn't order_it again
however the_chicken_tikka_masala_was the_best_i_have_had
i_will absolutely return_for that
i_did_not like_that_they charged extra_for rice
the_garlic_naan was_amazing_and went really well_with_the tikka_masala
our_waitress was_fantastic_and there_was_a busser water person that kept us comfortable while she_was away
they_also_had a_really_nice patio but it_was_pretty dark outside
this_is_a pretty_good indian_restaurant
a the_reviews say the_garlic_naan is_a_must and_i agree
the pompadom are light and_the_chicken_tikka_masala has just_right bite
overall i_was_quite pleased prices ate average for_this type_of restaurant
we really_love here
i've_lived in_india for a_half year
and sadly
i_like_it more here
we always_order paneer_tikka_masala with_garlic_naan
really_good
on lunch times_we also_like to_order lamb seekh kabob
we_also_tried tandoori_times but i_would_give
stars there
even though it's_a_bit further than it's worth_the_drive
it's_really weird that_there are_only like customers everytime_i visit
i_wonder how they_make money
the_food_is star
everything_is flavorful_and presented nicely
tv's at every booth
good_for children
only_negative is staff can_be slow_and sparse
the_paneer marsala is_very rich but mild though not a_problem just ask_for more kick and they_will gladly adjust
restaurant_is connect to
hotel so_i believe there_is wifi
also the_restaurant never seems more_than full
which_is_a plus for_me due_to children
honestly it the_best tasting indian_food i_have_tasted in_the_valley
so_far
everything_is a_la cart
this_place_is_a hidden treasure
hidden behind in_a hotel restaurant space it_can_be kinda hard_to find the_first_time
my_personal favorite_dish is the_goat_curry friday special
bring a_few dollar bills after
because a_beautiful belly_dancer comes_out in the_evening
when_the weather is_nice you_can dine on the_patio
the_food_is_very_good and_the_service_is tops
they_also_have_a full_bar
i_went_to tandoori_times through word from_a_friend that the_food_was_amazing
i_was_very hesitant considering i_had never_tried_indian_food before
we_were_seated right away_and it_seemed to_be getting busy so it_was_perfect timing we_got_a booth against the_wall
our_waitress greeted us right away_and informed us_that happy_hour was_about to_end at so we_got_our first drinks in happy_hour
she was_very_friendly when_we_asked about some_of_the items_on_the_menu she wasnt sure of_some the answers so she called man over
im assuming the_manager
and he_gave us the_whole run down of_the_menu
let me_tell you_what
if_you_have never had_indian_food_before you_are missing out
they recommended the_chicken_tikka_masala_and garlic_naan
amazing
i_dont know how i_have_never eaten_here before considering i_live right down_the_street
it is_a_little hard_to see and_hard to_get into but we_will for_sure be coming_back_here
overall great_experience_and excellent_food
we_were_not impressed
we purchased a_groupon and_the_server did_not inform us we_couldn't apply it towards our happy_hour purchases
we read the_groupon once we_got_our bill to_check and_yes that_is on_us to double check the fine print
but a_friendly reminder would_have_been nice since we_told him ahead of time_we_were using a_groupon
even_though_we were one_of only four tables occupied it took_over minutes_to_get any water or for_the server_to acknowledge us
the_chicken_was was_over breaded and tough
the_naan_was_good except_for_the way over burned edges
drinks_were ok
and dessert_was inedible
overall not a_good_experience or food
just ate here_for_the_first_time
and_loved_it
the_food_was_amazing
the_server recommended the_chicken_makhani
and_he couldn't have_been more right
lunch_special comes_with_a side salad
rice
and a_generous portion_of naan
the_server_was very_nice
let come_in and_have_a seat minutes_before they_opened so_i didn't have_to_wait i'm the_heat
will_be_back_for sure
i_ordered_the combo tuesday special with_lamb achari and chicken_makhani
it_comes_with dhal
rice
side salad_and naan
i upgraded the_naan to garlic_naan
the makhani was_better_than most i_have_tasted
the_lamb achari is_delicious
it's creamy_and spicy and_the_lamb jut melts in_your_mouth
definitely coming_back_here
the_food_here_is the_best
the_garlic nam bread_and chicken_tika_masala are_so_good i crave them
last_night i_tried bawarchi
a_little hole in_the_wall
fairly new_place on bell road
the place_is_clean_and attractive and_has_a reasonably_priced menu
we_saw that most_of_the clientele was ethnic so_it reasoned that_the_food would_be good
we_started out with_two meat samosas made_with ground lamb
not_greasy and_full_of meat flavored beautifully with fragrant spices
enjoyed it_very_much
they_were accompanied by coriander chutney and_a tamarind spicy mixture
don't know what that_was
we_also_had chicken_vindaloo
chicken_biryani
lamb_chops and_naan
the_chicken_biryani was accompanied by lentils_and yogurt
the_yogurt was_amazing as were the_lentils whose flavor profile included coconut
the lamp chops serving was ample but the_lamb_was chopped into pieces
my eating partner said_they tasted_good
the_vindaloo was_very_good although_not as_spicy as_i_had asked them to_make_it
restaurants_are afraid_to add too_much spice until they_get to_know you
everything_was_great until i_decided_to order the_kheer
for_dessert
i_like my kheer with raisins_and i_asked_if it_had raisins to which_they answered yes
no raisins in the_kheer but i_found_it to_be_very strange
at least for_me
i_have_never ever_had kheer with noodles in_it
meaning
kheer which_is_a rice_pudding is_usually made with_basmati_rice
well this_one had noodles as_well and_i i_did_not enjoy_it
since_it costs only
i_did_not make_a fuss
if_i_had paid over
i_would_have returned it to_them
when_i_got up to_pay_for the_kheer
because we_had already paid our bill
the_owner did not_want_to charge me_for the_kheer
maybe he read my_mind or my_stomach
i resisted the temptation
not to_pay
and insisted the_owner take his money
i_do want them_to stay_in business
it_is_a family_run business_and it shows
i_don't_have a_problem eating off_of paper_plates with plastic utensils
if_this bothers you
this_is_not_the place for_you
by_the_time_we left at
pm
the_restaurant_was almost full_of patrons
obviously
the_word has gotten out that_there_is good food_to_be had_here
seeing all_the_indian families eating_there is further proof that_the_food must_be seasoned_and prepared authentically
i_thought so
we_really
really_enjoyed our_meal bawarchi minus the_kheer
great_food
i_was_in from out_of_town and_i've recently become a_vegetarian
they_had_a great_selection_of indian_food_for me_and_my carnivore friend to chose from
i_highly_recommend_this_place and_will come_here again the_next_time i'm in_phoenix
excellent chicken dum_biryani
andra chicken_curry which was_also_very_good
highly_recommended
so happy_to_see another indian_place pop up by my_house
bawarchi is_a no frills
very casual
authentic little indian_restaurant
menu_is small_but covers most_of_the basics
we_had naan
aloo_gobi
palak_paneer
and_my hubs had_a chicken_curry
the_aloo_gobi was not_my_favorite
i_feel it_was mostly onions with very_little cauliflower and_potatoes
it_wasn't_bad
but_i_have had_better at_most other_indian_restaurants
the_naan was_very_good
so_was_the palak_paneer very_yummy
creamy
spicy
perfect
my_husband really liked his chicken_dish
i_like_that the_entrees came_with_a very_generous serving_of rice
some indian_places either make you_pay extra_for rice_or only give_you a_little_bit
i_am disappointed_that they recently raised their_prices on everything
the picture of_the_menu you_see on_yelp is_not accurate
in_fact the_menu they_gave us_with our_order had the_prices crossed out and_the raised prices written in
classy
but the_prices_are still excellent_and a_much better value than_other local indian_restaurants
we_will_be_back
again and_again and_again
i waited_for atleast visits and_dishes before_i wrote this_review
i_believe we_have_a winner
go_to_this_place for_the_food and_food alone
this_is_not_a place_for dining out
neither the_location nor the_ambience inside point to_that
it_is_great for_take_out
they_serve pretty quickly so_not much_of a_wait
prices_are_reasonable
the_staff_is_friendly_and the food_is_tasty
i_have_had the_daal
aloo gobhi
andhra chicken_and gosht biryani
all_good
i_will_be_back to_sample the_rest
the_best_place for_chicken dum_biryani
other non_veg dishes_are good
menu_is small_but covers most_of_the basic dishes
very cheap also
highly_recommended
great_place to_pick_up quick indian_food_in_the north valley
my_wife_and_i stopped by here_last_night after_reading_the other good reviews_on_yelp
seeing_the great_prices on_the_menu
and feeling_like watching a movie at_home with good_food
we_ordered chana masal
aaloo gobi
and vegatable biryani
all_three had excellent flavor and_spices
the_spice_level is_pretty high
which_is fine by us but if_you_are_not into heat you_may want ask_if they_can tone it_down
the_biryani came_in a_bag
which_was new_to me_but i_wonder if_that might be typical of take away curry_in india_and europe
although i've never been_to_india
this_food seemed more_authentic than_other restaurant_in_the_valley
keeping that in_mind
you_may want_to watch for spice pods
curry leaves and whole chillies in_the_dishes
as the_food_is less processed than you_may be use to
it_is_good to_have this_new place_for_indian
which offers great veggie_options and_meat options_as_well
great_prices with quick and_friendly_service
may_be_a bad day to_get chicken_tikka kebab
chicken kebabs looked_like they have_been sleeping for_days in_the freezer and_then got a_chance_to get into_the plate what_they call kebab
heard the biriyani is_good there
but_i_think i_am_not in_a mood to_try my luck again
no frills ricey indian
meh
great spot_for that sweet mango yogurt drink
wishing they_were still in_tempe
magic lost since_the move up here
stingy on_the meat
if_they run out
they'll give_you extra rice
what
i'm_not an_expert_on_indian
but_that rice_is soggy for_my_taste
my_indian friends say it_must cook for hours to absorb the_flavor
but they_also say it_should not_be mushy like_that
but_that mango yogurt drink is_a mean
sweet
beautiful thing
go_for_it
wishing that when_you ask_for_a on_the spiciness scale
that they'd give_it_a bit_more effort
we_found_this_place back_in early may
posted a picture some business information on_yelp_and look how quickly this took off
this_place isn't gourmet
but it_definitely hits_the spot
thanks_for opening a_really_good indian_place in_the_neighborhood
the_tikka_masala_and makhani are kind of runny compared to_tandoori_times
not_as thick
but the_owner_is kind
good customer_service
my_fav is the_mango lasse
chicken_tikka_masala_and chicken_makhani are_my favs
i_always call in_my orders beforehand
convinient to_go place
but always remember to_check our_food before_you take_it home
more_like_a fast_food concept
food_is made_to_order
like dosas
samosas
etc
big_fan_of their veg_and non_veg biryanis
true andhra style
was_disappointed with_their medhu vada
i_have_had tastier vadas at other_restaurants serving south_india vegan food
small_restaurant floor
i_guess that helps in faster service
i've_been_to most_places in_phoenix
and_this the_only place_in_town where u get real biriyani
in the_name_of biriyani many cook masala rice
i_would_definitely_recommend them for_any mughal cuisine
dirty
dirty
dirty
i_can't understand why people tolerate this sort of messy place
some_food items_were rather good dosa in particular
but_the majority_of the_ones we_had were_extremely oily compared_to other_places for_the_same dishes apps
their_prices really aren't much cheaper than full service places either
and it's_hard_to see why it is_worth_the savings
filthy dirty shame
this_place won't make_it on good_food only
this_is_the filthiest restaurant_i've seen in_many years
i've been three_times
and_the filth is_no fluke
it's_a standard here
trash is overflowing
food served_on filthy food trays
dried food_and crumbs on tables that only need_to_be wiped
filthy
dried food remains in_a tub above_the trash that also overflows
nothing is ever wiped down
trash on_the_floor
mold on_the fountain nozzles
last_visit
they_were_out_of ice
out_of ice
all_this filth
and_the_guy that runs the_register is rude_and is either eating_at the_register
standing with_his hands in_his pockets
or sitting at a_table where his laptop is_a fixed feature
i_think if_they replaced this guy with someone that_will do_the job
they_could fix a_lot_of their problems
i've never seen him make an effort other_than take an_order
which he_has trouble getting right as i've noticed people get food they_did_not order
their_food_is terrific
but this_place_will eventually be shut down by the_health department
they've received bad reports in_the_past and_made no effort_to improve
it's a_real shame
this_place could_be so_great
so easily
we won't be_going back
the_food_here was_good
we_really loved the_naan
we_would_have given_the place_stars
but_we knocked it_down a star_because the_price_is a_bit much_for a_vegetarian meal_and counter service
the vegetarian_options were around the_same_price as_the meat_options
garbanzo beans and_lentils are_much cheaper than lamb_and beef
andhra chicken_curry_and palak_paneer r the_best
best_place for dum_biryani in_phoenix
in_fact best biryani i_have even_had in_this country
unfortunately other_restaurants all have_their own versions of biryani_and call it_as traditional dum_biryani
my_friends have_taken me_to good biryani places so for_some_reason i_don't_think this_was_the_best biryani
but i_don't_know_if what i've_had was dum_biryani or_not
tried_the_chicken one and_it didn't_have_the flavor i though
maybe all those times it_wasn't truly authentic or from_a dif region
they_give_you_a lot_of rice though
not a_whole lot if chicken but you'll find_this under all_the rice
had_the_chicken_tikka_masala too and liked the_flavor_of the_sauce
ordered two mango_lassis
the_first one came out_about minutes_after we_got_our food
not before
the_second one came out_about minutes_after that_one
the_guy told_me the_lady was making them in_the_back
it_was_a_bit strange on_the timing but tells me that_there_was literally one_person in_the_back doing the_main cooking
cleanliness
i_am by no means a germ a phobe and rarely bothered by how a place_looks but_there_was something about_this_place that didnt sit right with_me
not_sure what but_i noticed it
i_thought_the reviews were over reacting but_for once there_is some legitimacy
thankfully i_just let it pass
i_will warn you though that the_owner or guy at_the_counter is_not so willing to_give up his to_go containers
i_asked_for a_second container to replace the_sauce container we_had bc it_had gotten really dirty
the_guy started pointing to_the container and muttered something before finally giving_it to_me
funny
despite all_this i_will_be_back
there_are_some things on_the_menu_that seemed more local to_the region that i_don't_see at_other_places so would_be great_to try_them
what do_you tell a kid who's got two a's and_one c in_a semester
you_can't commend him for_his performance nor can_you give him grief for performing badly
after_all two a's do count
don't they
and_this_is what_i thought when_i_got down_to review the bawarchi indian_cuisine
on_one hand
this_restaurant provides the_most_authentic andhra hyderabad food_i've_ever eaten to date in_the_phoenix_area
on_the_other_hand
there_are things_like cleanliness
service
quality etc
you_get the_point
which matter
and_it_is here that_this_place falters and_it falters badly
but_the_food
especially_the biryani_and andhra chicken_curry or_the lamb_chops are_very_good and_very true to_their taste
i_can't comment on vegetarian_food but_i believe_it won't be_very off
so_if_you are_looking_for some real authentic andhra hyderabad food
then_i think_you should head to_this_place
but_then for_the reasons mentioned above
you shouldn't hesitate to_take_a carry_out
self service restaurant
food is_ok
you_can_try once
you_will_not find smile on the_owners face
no cooler hot like hell
not clean to expected standards
inexpensive food
restaurant_is crammed
it's more_like_a
pros
good chicken_tikka_masala
pretty_good naan
yummy samosas
spicy_but_not too_spicy
very_reasonably_priced and_good for_takeout
friendly_service
cons
the_dal curry_had a strange consistency
echoing some_of_the earlier comments the_restaurant isn't_that clean
also not_a germaphobe and_have lower expectations for hole in_the_wall mom_and_pop shops
but_still seemed_like it_wasn't clean enough
my rating is for_the_food not_the place_to_eat
get take_out
little or no ac
the chicken_and_lamb dishes_were good_but_the bhindi was_dry
i_will likely go_back_and pick up take_out but i_would_not eat_there
great takeout
love_the_chicken tikka_marsala
we're fans
i admit it
biriyani is_my weakness
i_can fold for_a_good plate_of spicy biriyani any day_and bawarchi serves just_that
if_you_are there for_the_food
do_not be fooled by_the mediocre interiors although_the setting is_a_bit homely for_someone from south east asia
if_you_are_a meat lover go_for_the mutton biriyani or_if a_vegetarian
vegan biriyani with lassi will soothe your craving
i_cannot vouch for_the other_items in_the_menu but_i_will surely visit the_place often for i_always walk out_with_a smile on_my face
quality_is down_and i_hate to_see_this happen
mutton biryani_is my_favorite and i_used_to order one every friday
i_noticed lately that the_meat content has gone down significantly
now_i have_to_order two biryanis to_get_the quantity equivalent to_one
this makes_it very expensive compared_to others
i_am on_my quest to_find_a better biryani place
their andhra chicken_curry is_still the_best in_the_valley
ordered_a_chicken vindaloo for_takeout
when_i_got home
it_was in_a_small container which_was mostly sauce maybe slivers of_chicken
it_came_with rice but_i_will tell you_that i_will_never do this again
it_wasn't enough to_eat even as a_lunch
so disappointed
i_was_a fan
i_got_the chicken_tikka_masala_and the_garlic_naan_bread
everything_was all right
nothing super fancy
the_chicken had clumps of_some spice that i_couldn't tell you what_it_was
however
i_wasn't pleased with_that as_it_was an overpower explosion of spice_in a_few bites that i_discovered those
the_naan_bread_was rather rubbery and_the_garlic tasted sweet
to_be_honest with you though
it_did taste really_good_and for_the_price that i_paid
i_would_definitely return
my_husband_and_i are a_regular at_this_place
it_was_very_good and very_spicy
it_has several vegetarian_and_vegan options
food_is was_good_and cheap
everything else like customer_service
cleanliness etc is
multiple_times i them_to separate out_the potatoes_in the_dosa for_take_out so it_doesn't get soggy
they_do it the_time and_the_other half i_get a dirty look if_i make them do_it
sometimes they_will forget_to give_the items_that come_with the_order in take_out
since_the younger guy showed up the_quality_and quantity of_food
esp
the_biryani
has gone down
this_is depressing because_the_food initially was_incredible good_and price_was cheap
with they few changes they_could have_been the indian_restaurant in_the_area
in_short
the_best hyderabadi biryani
s
chicken dum
sp
chicken
goat and fish
in_phoenix
don't_even bother about the_rest_of_the menu
details
one_of_my hot spots to_have biryani during_my stay
in_phoenix
pros
very_tasty authentic hyderabad style dum_biryani
s
i_would also recommend_the spicy andhra chicken_curry_with garlic_naan
cons
it's_a poorly maintained spot
zero points to ambiance
menu_is very_limited to a_few_dishes
the_owner_is short tempered
be_careful and_don't poke him
lol
packing is poor
many_times they miss packing the sides
pay
wait and_eat
starts coz a_restaurant cannot be rated start just on_one menu item
d
if_you_are looking to_dine_in with_some elegance this_is_not_the place
if_you_want_to feast on possibly the_best indian_food_in_the_valley you have_found the_place
channa_masala was_delicious
garlic_naan_is fantastic_and the_chicken_tikka_masala_is great_too
you_cannot go_wrong with_this_place but be_prepared for_a plan b as this_place_will sometimes randomly be closed
try to_call ahead if_you_can
it's usually a_good indicator if everyone behind the_counter making your_food is wearing a sari
this_is_a very_good
authentic_indian_food place
i_also_like that it's_a walk up counter
so_you don't_have_to tip the_waitstaff
they_have tables there but_i usually_get my_order to_go during_lunch and it's_always pretty fast
i_like_the dal with garlic_nan or butter_chicken
it's nose running spicy_but it fills me_up and warms my soul
aaaaah
we_arrived
pm
the_door was opened with_a chair
and the_owner_was laying on_the chairs with_his feet up on_the_table
in the_dining_room
on_the_phone and_told_us they're closed until_pm
i_can't_say anything about_their food_but i_can_say their service_is atrocious
good luck to those who come_here in_the_future
i_hope_they clean the_tables for_their guests sake
the_food_is mostly pretty_good
not a_place_to dine_in
small stuffy and_hot
with_the hot oil burners in close vicinity to_the seats
the_biryani chicken_curry are_good
paneer mattar
ie
cheese with_peas
is_a waste
you_get pieces_of paneer floating in curry or_if you're lucky
being in_scottsdale
decent_indian_food is_hard_to come_by
so this_little hole in_the_wall stands out
it_is_on the_spicy side
which_is_great if_you_like that
the_big plus is
they recently opened an_indian grocery_store next door
they_have a_good_variety_of spices
daals etc
best biryani chicken dum that i_ever_had in_az
the_taste is_authentic
garlic_naan_and chicken_makhani are good_too
anyway
i_highly_recommend chicken dum_biryani
if you_really want to_try_the authentic_indian_food
this_is_the_place
price_is reasonable too
i_can_only comment on_the non meat portions of_the_menu
but_everything is_very_good and spicing levels are seemingly authentic
everything_is quite creamy buttery when ordered
like dosa
samosa
and the_curries
and therefore quite rich
their masalas
chutnies
sambar
etc
and_curry sauces_are all quite_good
naan_is medium sized
i_would_recommend methu vada
idli
masala_dosa
if_you_like southern_indian foods
the_sambar is_very_good with_it
navaratna koorma
aaloo palak and_some_of_the best among veg curries
biryani_is good
but i_am_used_to singaporean malaysian tamil style where they_serve on_a banana leaf with a_bowl_of curry_sauce
and without this briyani always seems dry to_me
though theirs is quite_good for_this style
rice_pudding is inexpensive
and very_good
when available
counter cafe style
well_spiced recipes for_a mostly indian clientele
quick_service
very well_priced
finally a_great_place_for curry near me right_off_the
have_gone here_several_times and_always impressed
i_cant waiver from the_chicken_tikka_masala_and garlic_naan
but thank god my gf gets the_palak_paneer so i_can_get another awesome flavor change
i_am yet to_see another white person in_there when_i_go so_you_know its authentic
but very_clean_and professional
small inside so_we normally get_it to_go_and there has_never been_a mistake made
great_food
inside seems a_little crazy when busy_but manageable
will_definitely be_going back
i go_to_this_place regularly because i_love hyderabadi dum_biryani but getting_a fresh biryani_is like winning a lottery
when ever the_biryani is_fresh its very_good_and nice flavour and i_love_it
but mostly on weekdays he_will serve you two_days old biryani which definitely microwaved food_because the_rice_and meat_is all dried up
when_you ask the_owner about the_biryani
he_is defensive and says its always_fresh
i never_tried anything here except biryani_and on_weekends mostly its fresh_and good_but on weekdays you_must be lucky enough to_get fresh biryani
chicken_biryani is awesomely spicy
i lucked out and_had_a regular give_me some tips on what_to_order
try any one_of_the naans as_well
you won't_be_disappointed
food_is_good
i_usually take chicken dum_biryani which is_really_good
high street
old_town is_one_of those touristy places you sort of expect it_will_be difficult_to find decently priced_and good_food
it_is usually one_of_the two you_get
so
real rajput was a_very_good find
you don't_see much from the_outside
but_it_is a_large room downstairs
the eggplant_dish i_tried was_very_good
but the_lamb karahi was_one_of_the_best dishes i_have_tried while_in the_uk
the_service_was_also good and_fast
and_did i_say it_was_not expensive given its location
great night out_on_the royal mile
the_staff here_are the stars of_the show but_the_food isn't bad either
as you_would_expect on_the edinburgh royal mile it_was_a_little more expensive than an equivalent quality restaurant elsewhere
the_staff_are the stars_because they provide a relaxed and_friendly atmosphere for your_meal
very_attentive but not_at_all overbearing
the_food_was_very_good and_i enjoyed every mouthful
an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc
my_only word_of caution i_found is_to visitors to_edinburgh in_general
when_they say hot up here they_don't just mean hot they mean very very_hot indeed
first_off
let me say we_went with_a_group_of people
this pretty much took up half the_dining_room
and_most_of these_were loud chatty college kids
the_wait_staff and manager were very_accommodating and the_service_was_very
very_good
the_tandoori grill items_were amazing
i_would_highly_recommend them
they_came out_on_a platter still steaming and smelling delicious
the_same way people bring_you fajitas in the_states same_thing
between four_of us guys we_got each one_and swapped and shared
they_were_all super good
we_had each_of_the varieties_of naan as_well
all were_excellent
the_chicken_biryani had very_generous amounts of_chicken chunks in_it and_the_rice_was fantastic
i'd_recommend a_plate_of that to_share with_your friends while you_get_a grill item
this_was_our last supper together as a_group before heading back_to_the states the_next_day
and_it_was_a perfect way_to cap off our_trip
good_food
good friends
great_service
very accomodating of a_large_group
and well_priced
i'd highly_recommend stopping in
note to self
edinburgh restaurants close early
we realized it_was
pm
so asked hotel for_a reco
that_said
we taxied a_few miles out away_from_the royal mile
headed for italian
dario's i_think
our driver said to_try another italian restaurant across_the_street but i_saw_the kama sutra sign beaming thru the rain and_had remembered it scored high on trip advisor
indian actually sounded good
so we_gave it_a_shot
the greeter waiter comedic hero seemed surprised but pleased to_see us
he seated_us quietly aside from_the two_other patrons
menus
wine please
navinder
he_had to spell and pronounce for_me
told_us the specials and_i_asked for_his recos
during this_time
we chatted up_and after_we mentioned we_were from ohio the talk rounded up_to
hello cleveland
quote for quote we_went_on spinal tap
i_love him
back_to_the food
i_had_a special starter
the scallops
which was_the_only low point of_the_meal
a_little overlooked so despite_the rich indian flavors
a_little hard going down
from_here out however
everything_else_was fantastic
man had_the achari bathak tikka duck marinated_in indian_spices
divine
not gamey and very_tender
we split a_plate_of chicken stuffed dosa
plain nan_and another special monkfish that_was deep_fried
surrounded by potatoes_and other steed veggies
oh_my god
delicious
man ate most_of_the_food while_i gabbed with the_staff
by this_time
navinder was joined by another server
the_owner_and the_chef
we_ended_up staying on much longer talking about everything form the_city to marriage to movie trivia and closed the_place with a_special drink concocted by the_second waiter
i_remember him mentioning elderberry something or other
the_chef was_the sweetest man alive and truly interested in_our feedback
the_owner_was hilarious
just_a joy to chat_with
i_particularly loved his take on how important service_is
he_also knew every movie i threw at him
rushmore
come_on
that's impressive
we_got pix with_the team and received a_nice send off as_we headed back in_the rain to_our hotel
sated and silly from a_great night_out
highly_recommend_this_place and_their original spot_in glasgow
one_of_the best dining experiences ever
wish_we could transplant them back_to_the states
hello cleveland
good_food_and very friendly_staff
i_have_been back many_times
best butter_chicken in the_whole wide world
on_our recent visit_to scotland
we stayed at sheraton
just as_we stepped outside the_hotel
we spotted this_indian_restaurant
across_the_street
we_ordered chicken_korma paratha for_dinner
when the_chicken_korma arrived on_the_table
my_husband asked_the_waiter for_some hot_sauce in_order to spice up the_dish
like_most indians would do
the_waiter went_back
and instead_of the hot_sauce
arrived a very_polite cordial gentleman alok singh
the_manager of_the_restaurant
seeing we_are indians who might_not prefer a_mild dish like chicken_korma
which we_had already ordered
he asked_the_waiter to_take_the korma away from our_table
he proactively offered to_order_a dish_of butter_chicken to_us
we_both were_a_little startled
embarrassed but_definitely appreciated his gesture eventually
great customer_service indeed
once the_butter_chicken arrived
not_only did my_husband not ask for_any hot_sauce this_time
he heartily enjoyed_the lip smacking dish_and inferred this_is
the_best butter_chicken i_have_ever_had
he meant he_had never even tasted anything close_to this flavorful dish
even in_any restaurant in_india
we_couldn't help going_back_to kama sutra on the_following night_for dinner
and_no prize for guessing we_ordered cheese_naan of_course
butter_chicken
despite its name
there_are not a_bunch_of people hanging out_here in precarious sex positions
instead
there_are a_bunch_of people hanging out_here eating delicious_indian_food
i
too
ate some_of this delicious_food_and have_to_say i'd_definitely recommend_it
nom
i_tried_this bizarrely named indian_restaurant_on my_last trip_to edinburgh
note
over a_year_ago
and_was delighted with_the_food
drinks_and service
the interior_of the_restaurant_was beautiful
spacious
well lit and not_at_all sleazy or as wacky as its name suggests
the_menu_is a_nice_change from_the standard indian_restaurants one finds in europe
from_what_i recall
some_of_the staple indian curries_were available
but most_of_the_dishes on_offer would_be relatively unknown to_the non_indian diner
this encouraged me to_try_something_new
nope
i_can't_remember what_it_was now
and_i wasn't disappointed
the_waiter knew some_of_the options were_a_bit unconventional
and gladly answered all_the questions we_had about level_of spicyness
comparison_to other_dishes
etc
portions_were slightly small_and prices_were slightly high considering its location
yet the great_service made_up_for_it
we_arrived_at the_restaurant late
and_after our_meal asked_if_we could order drinks
the_waiter explained the_restaurant_was closing but he_would keep the_bar open slightly later so_we_could have_some cocktails
such_a nice gesture
and_i recall the cocktails being fantastic
i_will_definitely return on my_next_visit to_edinburgh
i_have the honor of writing the_first review_for this new_restaurant
it_has_been open_for just over a_week now
the_decor_is your_typical
new
indian_restaurant strip_mall style
dark woods and_a_nice clean appearance
the_table set_up is certainly set_up with the_lunch_buffet crowd in_mind
not_a_bad thing as_there is plenty of space around each table
service_was fast_and friendly with even the_chef stopping by our_table to_check on_us
as of now
they_do_not have_a liquor license
but they_did say_they expect to_get_it in the_next couple_of_weeks
the important stuff
the_food
if_you_have read any of_my indian_restaurant reviews
we tend_to stick_with what we_know and_like
though today we_did go_with_a chicken_korma_and butter_chicken rather than chicken_tikka_masala_and just_for a_change
an_order_of the_aloo palak
well
honestly
it_was_good
very_good in_fact
the_sauces_were some_of the_best_i_have_had
certainly better_than origin and slightly better_than mt_everest
the only_negative would_be the_amount_of chicken used
let's say_it_was light in this_area
add some_more meat to_the dish_and it_would have_been_a home run
the_aloo palak was_good
i_am not_a_big_fan_of this_dish
but the_wife loves it and_she raved_about this version
the_naan
plain and_garlic
were superb
a_little thinner than i_normally like
but boy a_simple dish done perfectly
so all in_all
a_good_place_to eat
certainly the_best_indian on this_side_of_town
i_went_to_this place_at the_last minute w my gf who was_craving_indian_food
both_of_us love_indian_food very_much and_have been_to_many of_them
this_was among the_best we've been_to
first the_food
which is_probably_the most important aspect of_any dining_experience for_me
you_can_have bad_service and great_food_and reluctantly find yourself going back_from time_to time
but_a place_with bad food_and_great_service is less likely to_be revisited
the_food_was absolutely_delicious
you_have_to try_the_chicken
or_something like_that it_has_a number in the_name
it's an_appetizer dish_with chicken that appears to have_been marinated and_then cooked_in_a batter or_something
idk i'm_not_a foodie and i_don't_know all_the intricacies of_how a_dish is prepared
all_i know is that_it_was damn_good
i_had meant to_get_a dish_to go_on my_way back_home the_next_day but forgot
the_other_dishes were almost as_good way better_than standard
but_not quite as exceptional as the_appetizer
for spiciness
we_got which_was just perfect_for us
we like_it pretty_spicy though
so for_people less tolerant
you_might want_to dial it_down a_bit
service which i_think_is the_second most important in_any dining_experience
was phenomenal i_would_say it_was_pretty close_to an all_time best for_me
we_had sat down_and since_my gf is_the foodie i let her pick the_dish while_i proceeded_to check something on my_phone
as_soon_as_i whip out my_phone
the_manager comes and asks if_i need access to_the wifi
which_i gratefully accept
the_rest_of_the evening is just_as attentive
friendly
and considerate
i_don't_have time to_go into all_the details
but_all of_the_staff were_extremely pleasant
and_attentive
they_are also_very international which i_really_liked a_lot
there_were indian staff of_course
but_also caucasian
eastern asian
and_other ethnicity as_well
india
which_has historically been a_major fulcrum of_the silk road is_well represented by_the people_working here
it_was_an absolutely delightful dining_experience
adding another dimension to_the tasteful decor_and immaculate ambiance
it_almost makes_me not_want_to leave a_good review in fear that it_will_be over crowded the_next_time we_visit
but the_people working_there really deserve every bit_of the praise
i_wish_i_had more time and_the descriptive capacity to_do them justice
but you'll simply have_to experience it for_yourself
ps
i rarely ever do yelp_reviews btw
but_this_one i really_wanted to_do
this_is hands_down_the_best_indian restaurant_in_town
went_here_for both lunch_and_dinner and_was overwhelmingly satisfied each time
lunch
they're lunch_buffet_is huge
with
i_was given a_selection_of items
dishes
is_usually standard in_any indian_buffet
in_an_indian buffet_is unheard of
and it_gets better
what makes india_masala stand_out from its competitors is_that besides having nearly triple the_quantity of_dishes to_choose_from for_less_than
you're always in_for_a surprise
unlike other traditional indian_buffets
the_items_on_the buffet_at india_masala change everyday
some traditional items such_as chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori_chicken
dal makkhani etc
remain
but_for the_most_part
dishes change each day
also
it features both north south_indian_dishes in their_buffet
in_the_end
best_indian_buffet_in vegas
dinner
when_i step into any restaurant
there_are things_i stick my neck out_for
food
ambience
service
the_food_is phenomenal
my_friends_and_i ordered a_family dosa
its a_big big crepe about feet long
also
i_had_the_chicken as_an_appetizer
lamb madras curry
and garlic_nan
chicken_was highly_recommend by our_server
it_didn't disappoint
it_was_a dry red chicken
the_flavor_was quite different_and thus hard to_explain
all_i remember is_that each bite felt electric
literally
lamb madras curry_was also_great
i_ordered_a spice_level and it_was_perfect
the_curry had_a_great depth of_flavor
ambience_is very beautiful
as_for_the service
this_restaurant knows what_it_is doing
they're service is_outstanding
i'm_going_to start_off letting everyone know how_i found_out about_this_place
these people_are the_same people as_the india_masala in_the_riviera hotel
i_have_been going_to that_one since_i found_out about_it and_they told_me about_it this_new one and_i_thought why_not lets give_it_a try
my_friend_and_i decided_to_check out_there buffet which_is
a_fairly decent price_for having choices ranging_from north_indian curries to south_indian curries_and even indo_chinese thrown in_there as_well
also
for a_dosa lover like_me
they_offer it_in their_buffet
i_had tandoori_chicken
pakora
chicken_tikka_masala
of_course
goat_curry
fish_curry
curd rice
avial
a_south_indian dish
which was_pretty_good
tamarind rice
rasam
a_south_indian spicy tamarind soup
raita
and obviously naan dosa
okay so all_of_it didn't fit in a_plate
i_had_to make a_couple rounds
and_even though my_friend kept making fun of_me
i_felt satisfied for_the i_had spent
overall
for an_indian_lunch_buffet this_place surpassed my_expectations
i'm usually very hesitant when_it_comes_to going_to indian_lunch_buffets because i've had_a_few bad experiences here_in_vegas but_this
my_friends is_a safe and sumptuous choice
my_friend_and_i have decided because_we enjoyed_this so_much and because_of its proximity to campus
unlv
we are_going to_come at least times a_week because_we_were assured that_they will_have varying items every_day
the_staff is_very_nice_and helpful as_well but like_i said earlier we_went_to a_buffet so_we didn't_have as_much interaction as you_would during_dinner
we_are planning to_have dinner_there sometime soon because they_have such_a huge_menu
so i'll keep you all posted
beautiful delicious
i_always crave indo_chinese_food but_had not_come across a_place_that serves these options in_vegas
for_this reason
i_was_really_excited when_i learnt that this_new place_had opened_and had_a_groupon out as_well
indo_chinese is basically the indianized version_of chinese_food
as in_india we like_to spice everything up
the_place_was busy with_people at_the_restaurant as_well as several take_out orders being fulfilled
we_were_seated without delay and_got water
they soon brought_out_a complimentary papad with types_of chutnety sweet tamarind and coriander and_both_were yummy
the_server informed us that_they_were backed up in_the_kitchen and_it would_take minutes_to_get our_food
so_we_decided to_order_a veg samosa to_share
the_samosa was pretty_nice
she soon brought out the_veg manchurian i_had ordered and_this_was really_good
d ordered the_veg thali which_was huge_and came_with veggies bhindi
okra
masala
alu matar
potato_and peas curry
black dal
raita yogurt
papad
lots of_rice_and fresh baked naan_bread
it_also included_a mango achar relish and_a desert seviyan
which_is_a milk based desert like kheer but_with vermicelli instead_of rice
i tasted the_desert and_it_was super yummy
the_good thing_about the_thali was that_everything looked home_made and_was_not dripping in oil
the_desert reminded me_of desert i_ate at_home in_india
the_service_was_great
our glasses_were never empty and_our_server checked_in with_us each time she crossed our_table
all_the_other helpers and servers_were also_very customer oriented and_everyone at_the_restaurant looked happy_to be_there
i_am excited to_try_their south_indian_dishes and will_definitely go_again
i_was suspicious about the_great_reviews
but being_a lover of_indian_food
had to_find_out for_myself
don't believe_the hype and fake reviews
while the_interior_is nicely_decorated
the_food_quality and selection_is mediocre at_best
they_have about selections and_not_the items_that another review claims
surprisingly
they lacked the_standard staples of lunch_buffets like pakora
samosas
saag
and_even kheer
while the_naan_and chutneys_were ok
the currys and dahl were subpar
they tasted watered_down and lacked the_spice and complexity that_they ought to_have
according_to their_website
they_were supposed to_have_some indo_chinese type dishes_in their_buffet but those items_were completely absent
for_dessert
they had_some weird vermicelli served_in_a warm and_sweet milk
reminiscent_of kheer
but_not tasting very_good
regardless
now_that i_know better
i'll be sticking with_my tried and true favorites
i
e
mt
everest
i have_no_idea who writes these reviews
but_this_place has_been waaaay overrated
friends
maybe
i_am indian and_have_been on_a endless search_for the_best_indian_food
still searching
i figure if a_place can do a_decent indian_lunch_buffet then they atleast serious about cooking authentic_indian_food during non buffet times
i went_for_the_lunch_buffet
which_i admit must_be mildly seasoned to broaden customer appeal yet can't_be too costly for the_restaurant to_make_a profit
but_i expect flavorful seasoning and_variety
everything_was underseasoned
not_enough salt or hot spice
there really was none
the_buffet_had the appearance of_being bountiful because_of_the meat and_vegetables were_in_the front buffet
it_definitely captivate the eyes and stomach of customer
however once at_the_buffet i_found_it not logically flowing once at_the_buffet
it_does not flow logically
which would_be flowing from appetizers_and papadums
to rice
noodles
and breads then veggies_and meats
here the_buffet started_with plates
tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka
fish_curry
daals
vegetable curries
all_very soupy items_that probably should_have rice_or a starch served first so_the sop up_the gravies
in_addition
too_much repetition
proteins fish_curry and types_of chicken
tandoori
wings
tikka
and_curry
daals
and batter fried vegetable and cheap starchy filed vegetable_dishes
a gobi filled_with chana and_a
vegetable
curry dominated by potatoes_and peas
not reflective of_the delicious quality vegetables dishes indian_cuisine has_been admired for
no paneer
as_a_vegetarian source of complete protein instead_of another chicken_dish
furthermore
a_very disjointed buffet offering
sambar without idli or dosa
mint_chutney and tamarind_chutney without samosa or chaat
come_on
you give_the facade of bounty
but_it_is incomplete
you_know better
but undermine true indian_buffet fans in_order to cut costs
there_are a_ton_of indian_buffets that_are better_for the_same_price and_most are around you
while this commonly happens at_most buffets
it seem_to be with every gravy dish
all_the
good
stuff was gone and it_seemed once it_was finished
it_was finished
yet coming at_pm_and the_buffet_is from
to
pm
i_do expect it_to_be replenished
but didn't_see it happen in_the minutes i_was_there
understandably the_dishes_were mild
but_there should be some
hot
sauce condiment offered
i didn't_see any
but_i also never asked for_any
out_of all_the_dishes the_tandoori_chicken was_the_best
it remained juicy yet it_was_still underseasoned and definitely_not cooked_in_a tandoori
one_of_the more promising things_about the_restaurant_was that the_atmosphere_was
nice
and up_to date and most_importantly the_service_was way above par of most_indian_restaurants
as an_indian it_is rare to_get treated as_well as
non_indian
customers
here our water_glasses_were never less than half_full
and_they appropriately checked_on us_from time_to time without fussing or discriminating
came here_for_the_lunch_buffet
and_left satisfied
the_place_was moderately busy_and had_a_nice selection_of the_usual buffet selections
there weren't as_many veggie_options as i_would_have_liked
but_the options offered were_all pretty fresh_and not overspiced
our_server_was nicely attentive_and unobtrusive
refilling water_glasses with a_smile
this_place served as a_welcome oasis to begin the_new school year
within_a four mile radius of the_university is_a plethora of_indian_restaurants
india_masala is_another to_add to_the mix
but_it tends_to fall short compared_to the_others
they_serve a_lunch_buffet from
for
price wise
it_is similar to_all_the others
where_it falls flat is_in_the offerings
im offers_a variety_of_dishes that are_not often seen at_other_places
the_vegetable_korma is_a primary example of this_point
it_was_the one i_enjoyed_the most
the well_seasoned mix_of mushrooms and_potatoes with_the mango_chutney gave a balanced taste_of sweet_and savory
the_rice in the_chicken_biryani was_also decious
it_was soft
pillowy
and_flavorful
i scooped around_the dried chicken pieces_and went_with_the tandoori instead
most_of_the time
it_is best to_pass on the_tandoori because_it just sits out_and loses all_the moisture
not theirs
instead
i_found_it to_be tender_and moist
other_than those three dishes
i_was_not impressed
the_service
on_the_other_hand
was polite_and friendly
the decorum
spacious and_warm
with so_much potential
i_hope to see_them tweak the_menu a_bit_more
i wouls like_to come_in for_dinner_and just order ala_carte
it's about time i_found a_truly good indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was delicious when paired with_their perfectly_cooked garlic_naan
slightly crispy as_well as soft and_chewy
tried the_goat_curry which_was_nice and earthy
my_date thought some parts of_the_meat were_too tendony but_i surmised that_it's because when cooking such_an unusual meat
they probably used most parts of_the animal
my_only true complaint_was that our_waiter pretty much forgot to_take_our_order and_no_one else came_by our_table in_a_long_time
there were_only other_tables being_served at_the_time
we didn't_get to_eat til about_minutes from_the time we_sat_down
i'm willing to forgive this hopefully one_time incident because_of_the surprisingly_good food
i_was treated to_a spectacle of_the family sized dosa being_served at the_next table
it_was huge
can't_wait to_come_back_and try_it
hands down
the best_indian_food_in_las_vegas
being_a las_vegas resident and_having eaten_indian_food across the_world
i_can honestly say_that india_masala is_an absolute winner
the_interior_is plush
comfortable
clean
and_well built
from the_moment you_walk_in
you_feel that you_are transported for_a dining_experience half_a world away
i_think what knocks out_the competition are_the unique and_flavorful spices
spices i_have_never tasted before
the_entree melts in_your_mouth and wanting more and_more
the_menu_has everything you_could ask_for in_an_indian_restaurant
and_the_service_was top_notch
i_was also shocked at_the outstanding prices
basically
i_cant wait until i_have the_chance_to eat there_again
recommend for_any occasion without hesitation
awesome hospitality
very_clean
joseph
nicole were serving us_with great hospitality
being vegetarian_and indian too
we_know the_taste_of indian_dishes
we_ordered papadi chaat
idly sambar
rasam
and uttpam
all there taste excellent
one note
if_you_love spicy
and real spicy you_need_to say
try pista kulfi as dessert
sambar
and coconut_chutney was not_that_great but_it_was just_ok
wasnt hungry much_so tried only appetizers
did_not try any main course
definitely we_will come_here again
awesome_place
this_place_is beautiful
the_decor_is classy enough_for date_night
yet not_so over the_top that you_feel under dressed at_lunch
it_is as_all buffets should be
clean_and neat and well_stocked
we_came_here after_a disappointing stop at ghandi the_week earlier
the_service_here is_wonderful
very_nice_and friendly also mindful and considerate
full water_glasses at_all times
we were_offered fresh naan_bread_and it_was_great
the_mango_lassi_was affordable and generous
i_do_not know what_is expected of_indian_dishes officially
i_only know_if like what_i had or_not so please keep that in_mind
the_first_time_we went we_loved it
there_were large chunks_of_chicken in the_butter_chicken_and an_amazing lamb_curry
kessla
dessert which_was over the_top
we_loved this
lemon_rice and unique vegetarian_dishes i_gave a_try
well_cooked basmati_rice
tandoori_chicken
soups
pakora
the_second_time came around and_it_was also_great
the_chicken_curry was_amazing
told friends
then came a third time_and
hmm
things changed
butter_chicken had tiny thin strands of_chicken not_at_all the_same kind from before
there_was no lamb curry_which_was disappointing to_me
and some_dishes that_looked good_but had bones in them including the_chicken_curry
the_first_time it_was made without bones
i personally won't eat any gravies or curries with bones
there_was_a mango dessert that_was unique
i_never tried_the salads and smaller items
by_the_time i_make it_to_the back wall i_am full i_did_not count how_many items but_there_is surely enough to_choose_from
so we_would prefer more consistency in_quality as customers
however that's the_only issue we_had here
no_one got sick
nothing bad happened it_was_a pleasant experience
the_place_is really_nice_and deserves a_shot
i_never had_dinner_here and_i_am dying to_try_the cashew chicken
we'll go_back thats for_sure
i'm_not_a fan_of_indian but_this_place was_as_good as_you_can get
the_service_was perfect_and the_food_was_good
the_only_thing i_would_have_liked was_more ice in my_water because the_food_was_so spicy
this relatively new_restaurant is_an upscale offshoot of india_masala located in_the_riviera food_court
it is_decent size and_nicely appointed
we_shared vegetarian_and tandori thalis that included a_variety_of vegetarian_entrees and sides
pappadum with chutneys
tandori_chicken
basmati_rice
naan
chicken_tika
and_rice_pudding
everything_tasted pretty_good
but_i_thought prices_were high in relation to the_quantity of_food served
on_our next_visit i_will opt for either the luncheon buffet_or order regular entrees
a rating of
would_be more appropriate
nice_ambiance and_the_wait staff_was_friendly
i_think there_are much better_indian restos in_town
my_main qualm was_that the_food_took a_long_time to_come_out and_we_were one_of only_two parties there
there_were also no togo pick ups at_the_time
pm
so it_was_a_little frustrating
the_other thing i_didn't_like was the_portions_were smaller than expected
the_food_was_a little blander than the_way_i like_indian_food
but maybe you_can request a higher spice_level
as said before
nothing_special
this_place_has excellent_food
this_is_one_of_the top meals we_had while visiting_vegas
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka with_a_side_of lemon rice_and_garlic_naan
i_can't emphasize how_good this_was and_we_will be_back_for_more
this_is_by_far the_best_indian_food_i_have tasted
the lemon_rice was_delicious
highly_recommend_it
the_chicken_tikka_was juicy and favorable
we_have_tried indian_food_at lot_of tourist places
but_the indo_chinese_food and the_appetizers were_very_tasty
the_staff_was also very_accommodating
will_visit again_when in_vegas
yum
yum
this_place appeared out_of no where
i_think there_was_a mongolian grill type place_and_i ate_at only once in this_location
i_was_not holding out too_much hope since this_restaurant_is two blocks away from_my previously favorite_indian_food establishment
let me_tell you why this_place rocks
first
the_waiter was_friendly_and able to_make recommendations
then we_got_the food
whoo
i_had_the tikki_masala with chicken_and my_friend_had the_butter_chicken
i_had buttered naan_and she_had the capati
the_spices in_the tikki_masala were incredible
the portion_of the_naan was_more_than i_could_have hoped for
my_friend really_enjoyed her food
we_both_had enough left_overs to_take_home and_have lunch the_next_day
why is this_place better_than_the joint down_the_street
better quality taste_and our bill_was smaller
tried_this_place for_the_first_time tonight
loved_the_food and_the_service_was_great
can't_wait to_come_back_and try_different stuff
review for_the_lunch_buffet only
my indian_buffet resume for las_vegas thus far includes saffron_flavors_of_india
summerlin
taj_palace
henderson
and the_neighborhood rival a_few blocks down
mint
in_general
what_i look_for in indian_buffets is value
variety
and_flavor
thus far
i_think taj_palace wins in_flavor
mint has variety but seems_to always underwhelm me_in the_flavor category
and saffron is severely lacking_in variety
no tandoori_chicken
i literally observed an angry customer lecture the_waiter on the_lack_of tandoori_chicken_and then proceeded_to order some on_top_of his buffet
not_quite ready_to proclaim india_masala as best one in_town since_i still need_to cross off mt
everest and namaste off the_list
but_for value
see below
and_variety
they deserve some props
in_general
i_have_been surprised_by_the high prices_for indian_buffets_in vegas compared_to some other_places i've_lived
almost always in_the double digit dollar range
and_i'm at a_point in_my_life where_i no_longer have_the capability to polish off plates dessert to_get_my money's worth so just_like an aging greg maddux who_has to_add some off speed pitches to compensate for_his slower fastball or michael jordan adding a fadeaway to his shot selection during_the second half_of his career
i too had to_change up_my game
and_this buffet_is ideally suited for_my plan of attack
back_in college
when_my roommate and_i_were short on cash
we_would routinely compete to_see who could pack the_most food_in_the local indian_restaurant
take_out buffet
styrofoam tray
over several trips
we_came up_with_the ideal arrangement which consisted_of wet items_on_the bottom
layer of_rice to soak up_some flavors but_with dry side above
as_much tandoori_chicken as we_could fit
then cushioning everything with_naan and_other odds and ends
this ended up easily being_the equivalent of meals while preserving the integrity of of each_item
so when_i showed up one_day from my_office with a_short lunch break
i_went_with the_buffet_to go option and_was ecstatic when_they presented me not_only with the_usual styrofoam tray
but packed my_naan separately in tinfoil and gave_me two additional styrofoam bowls
huzzah
my college roommate would_be nodding in approval as_i packed my tray full bursting at_the seams but_now had_two additional bowls which_i could pack with soup
dessert
salad
or additional rice_or any liquid item suitable for_dipping my crispy warm naan
all_in all_i foraged enough_food to feed a_small indian_village
in_terms of_variety
this_is_a double edged sword since like_other reviewers have mentioned
this can_be hit_or_miss both in_terms of_quality
some_dishes soared whereas others fell flat
and_the expectation of seeing your favorite_dishes being present on any given day is highly variable since they_do_a good job
perhaps too good
of rotating dishes in_and_out
i've_been_here times
and_i've seen at least distinct dishes not present from before including sauteed okra
fish_curry
egg curry
goat_curry
and_the occasional indo_chinese_food item
definitely get this when it_is available
the setup of_the_restaurant inside is_very_clean
spacious
and_welcoming and for_someone that appreciates variety
i_like the_fact_that they_take chances and_have something_for everyone
but_not everything_is for_everyone
it's_an educational foodie experience to_see_the a_wide spectrum of_rice dishes
unique desserts
and breads that_you won't know_if you_will like unless it's put forth in_front_of you
one glaring omission from the_buffet_is the_samosas since i_have_yet_to see an appearance and_while taste_of specific items may_not be superior to_other buffets across town
it_definitely edges out mint head to head for_the_lunch_buffet on_the_east side since they_are_not afraid_to throw in_some spice_and i'd much rather the_items err on being bold than being bland
stars with an_extra half star bump due_to_the hidden value in getting their_buffet to_go
this_review_is_for_the buffet_only
since_i_was so pleased with_my food_when i_visited last time
i_thought about trying the_buffet
they_had types_of chicken
tikka_masala
tandoori_and something called chicken veduppu
spelling
i_had_a small piece_of the veddupu chicken_and it_was_really_good and_seemed to_have good_flavor
the_tikka_masala_was ok
i_was_hoping for atleast a_couple_of options of_the indo_chinese dishes
but_all they_had was_a schezwan veggie dish
which_was super super_spicy and_i_could just_have a_few bites
they_also_had dosas which though fresh were_not crisp
and_were wrongly labeled as utthapam
about_the labels i_would_suggest that_they take_care to label food properly
as they_had labeled the_potato mix that goes with dosas as aloo gobhi
cauliflower potato
the mix itself_was ok_and had_very large pieces_of potato_and was obviously not the_original stuff served_with dosas
so_the things i_was looking_forward_to south_indian and indo_chinese were seriously lacking_in taste
for veggies
they had_a_few options okra
black dal
some veg curry
i_tried a_bit_of the_okra and dal and_they_were just_ok
desert was_pretty blah too
pink colored fruit custard and halwa
they_need to really consider labeling and arranging the_food_in a logical order
as_i remember standing in_the_middle_of_the buffet looking_for rice
as_it_was placed next_to_the desert
the halwa was labeled 'kesari' which i_think_is a_south_indian version_of halwa so_i knew it_was desert
however
for_my non hindi speaking friends
it_might have_been confusing as_it_was placed next_to the_rice_and could_have passed off as_a savory dish
i_guess these_are initial glitches and_i do hope_they improve
as_i would_love_to have_one indian_restaurant_in_vegas that_serves consistently good_food
not_overly impressed
large_selection of entree dishes
no saag_paneer though
everthing was_good
just_not extraordinary
seems_like they go_for quantity over quality
i_will_say the custard with fruit was_some_of_the best ive had
service_was_friendly_and attentive
overall decent_but mint a_mile west on flamingo has much better_food
though a smaller selection
a_good place_for_indian_food
the_decor_and service were superb
dinner
our_experience was more_like
stars
but_i'll give_the nice attentive_staff an_extra half star_for effort
first_off
i'm thinking
what's
jainism
this_was_the_first time_i've ever encountered an_indian_restaurant_that had dishes for_those who observe jain as_a religion
and_as_a cuisine
or_at least identified as jain on_a menu
quickly_and secretly reading wiki
i_find that_their cuisine consists of_a refusal to_eat
bulbs
meaning no garlic
onions
potatoes or such
fascinating read
jainism
but back_to_the meal
we_had a_lot_of_food
cuz we had_a_groupon
but_also cuz we_love so_much about indian_cuisine
and simply don't_go enough
cuminium
a cocktail containing gin
absinthe
cumin and other_things
it_was_actually quite interesting
and enjoyable
vegetable_samosas
not_the_best we've_had
but quite_good
andhraspicy masala_dosa
under_the
southern_indian
column in_the_menu
this was_quite_good
kinda like having the_samosa again
except in_a crepe
dusted with_a spicy powder that
like szechuan pepper
built up spice_in the mouth
great dipping_sauces
including one akin to_a minestrone soup
highly_recommended
and in_fact
i_think_the
southern
column
or vegetarian selections
is the_way_to_go here
keep reading
flying horse lager
split_a tall indian_beer
this_one we_had never before encountered
it_was light but worked with_the main_courses
shrimp chettinadu
billed as a_spice concoction
again
something we'd never before encountered
unfortunately the_shrimp were overcooked
but the_sauce
very_dry for_a sauce
was interesting enough
lamb pepper fry
again the protein
this_time lamb
was_overcooked
tough
but the_onions
grilled and raw
not_a jain item
and other_things made_it overall tasty
so overall we_thought india_masala was_about mid way in_this town_for its quality of_indian_cuisine
we've_had worse
we've_had better
i_want_to eventually return for_the_lunch_buffet
i_have_found that_some places which aren't quite successful at_dinner do quite well_with their_buffet
but_as for_dinner
i_might go_back if friends insist
and_only go vegetarian
or_maybe be jain
for_an evening
addendum
oops
forgot_to mention
i_had brought a_bottle_of gewurztraminer to_have with dinner
corkage was quoted as twenty five dollars
and_they're not_even on_the_strip
so_don't bother bringing your_own
just order_a cocktail and split_a beer
as we_did
what a_great_find in_vegas
discovered_this_place through restaurant
com
good_food
clean_and spacious facility
reasonably_priced
very short ride from_the_strip
pleasing decor
i_enjoyed my_meal thoroughly
i_live in in la and visit vegas at least times a_year
i_am glad_i found a_good india restaurant there
don't hesitate_to try
i was_excited_to_try this_restaurant yesterday because_it's one_of_the_few indian_restaurants that_serves south_indian_food
i checked the times on the_website and facebook for_dinner service_and arrived during what i_thought_was dinner service
i_was_told the_restaurant_was not seating customers because_of a private party
only takeout was_available
anyone familiar_with south_indian_food
ie dosas
knows it_doesn't lend itself to takeout so_i left disappointed and doubt i_will_go_back
so_my review_is_for poor_service
why_not post on facebook that_there_is no dinner service
not the_food
i_would advise anyone to_call before making_the trip to_make_sure you_will_be served
the low rating is due mostly to_the poor customer_service received at_this_restaurant
i_think there_are_better indian_restaurants_in_vegas and_i_would not_come back_here_again
waited forever sitting at_the_table before getting our_order taken
had_to_ask_for water multiple_times and_once my_bf gave_the evil eye to the_manager did we_finally get_some help
the_place wasn't_that busy either
maybe tables
i_am_not_sure if_it_was because_we_were foreigners in_the_restaurant but our_waiter ignored us a_lot and_then later seemed scared to approach our_table since_we_were pretty upset
when asking about menu_items
it_seemed_like alot_of them were_not available that_night which sucked
the_butter_chicken we_ordered had pieces_of bone in_it and_had_to pay extra_for rice on_the side
i_mean putting aside the_customer_service
the_food_was ok_but i_would_not repeat since_it_was very slow_service
when not busy
and the_whole experience seemed pretty miserable
this_review_is_for_the lunch_buffet
this is_a_nice looking restaurant
big buffet there_were lots_of choices
and_definitely more vegetarian_friendly options than nearby mint
i_think_they are_a_little better_than mint in terms_of sheer flavor_and spice_level while still_not where i'd_like it_to_be
it's a_little_more flavorful than typical_indian buffet_food
the_malai_kofta was_good_and so_was_the aloo_gobi the_latter had_a_nice fresh gingery flavor
naan was_served piping_hot but our_second basket didn't make_it to_our_table until we_were almost done eating
the service_was_a_bit tricky in_general several different people waited on_us
and_there_was no coordination between them
and_they could_be a_little_slow
at_one point we_waited like minutes_for someone to_get us drink refills
and_then right after we_asked one guy to_get them
another was asking if_we_wanted refills
it_was confusing and inefficient
it's somewhere between and stars as far_as vegas indian_buffets but_i_am erring on the_side_of less stars_because of_one glaring buffet omission
paneer
where was the_paneer
india_masala is
okay
i_had_heard about_their location in riviera but_there's no_way i'm braving the_strip
its tourists and_its prices just for_indian_food
so_when my_wife_and_i saw india_masala had finally opened a_second location while_we_were on_our way_to our preferred indian_buffet
mint
we_decided we_had to_try_it
in_short
we should've just stuck with_mint
there's nothing objectively bad about india_masala
you_could even make_the argument that the_food_is a_bit_more flavorful than_the seemingly afraid of_spice mint
but whether it's the_decor
the_service or the_selection
something about_this_place just_didn't click with_me
another disappointing contestant in_a city that_is
sadly
completely bereft of_indian_restaurants
and where oh where is the_gulab_jamun
we_ordered naans
chicken_curry_and chicken_biryani to_pick_up in_indian masala when_we_were in_vegas on vacation
we_didn't know_that indian masala has branches one on strip and_one here
we_went_to the_one on strip and_then came_here
coz they_said they're different
what_a waste of_time
anyways
it's our mistake to_get confused
coming to_the_food
what a_horrible food
sooo disappointing
the_naans are burnt to_the core
i somehow managed_to get_one small piece that_wasn't burnt and_it_is uncooked
how_can somebody manage to burn so_much yet uncook
chicken_was soooooo raw and_had bones
a_good vet could still have saved the hen
this_review_is_for dinner
quick review
food_was_good but_the_service_was very_very bad
details
i_have_been_to this_place several_times since its opening
service has_been okay so_far
but tonight it_was disastrous
it_took more_than minutes to_take_the order
once order was_made
food_arrived in reasonable time
but_after this no_one cared to_check our_table for more_than minutes
the_restaurant_was not_even busy
we_finished our_food and_were kept waiting
even the_water was_not refilled
i_thought of ordering another dish_and a_dessert
but the_lack_of service made_me decide against it
came_in_for dinner because a_friend_of_mine told_me about_this_place and_i_have_to_say i_wasn't just served a_meal like all_the_other restaurants do here in_town i_feel_like i_was given a_great_experience for_the short while_i_was there
the_staff_was extremely knowledgeable about_the_food there which_was great because i_am_not too familiar_with it and_after my_food order_was taken the_bartender
whom was_extremely beautiful and charming
came and personally took_my drink order even_though_the place_was_pretty busy
she made_me their signature india_masala cocktail and_it_was hands_down_the best cocktail i've ever_had in_my_life hats off_to the_bartender
the_food_came_out in_a reasonable time_and the_food_was_amazing
best food_i've_had_in years i_gave my compliments to the_chef
the_prices_were very_reasonable and as_i_was leaving they acknowledged i_was leaving
gave mea big smile
and_said to come_back_again and_it_was_a pleasure to_have me
they hit all_the notes to_what wonderful customer_service_is and_i_am definetely going back there_again soon
ok
i already tried the_one they_have on riveira casino
frist impression of that_place wasn't_that great
so_i_had spoiled potatoes_in my_favorite_dish
dosa
after that i_never went_there
then_i heard this_place
gave_the frist try with_our family
in the_evening time wan't that busy and_we_had great welcome from the_front desk and_the_waiter guy_was kind enough to_bring three high chairs for_our baby to_make_the broken one replaced
he_was no smile and pleasent
bar tender dude was ecceptional and_he knows what_he doing
he_made great magarita and_his generous service_was make any one happy
i_tried_the chicken_tika dosa twise
really
it_was_that good
only_the down fall was the_shrimp biriani the shrims were bad taste_like they_were uncooked
the_waiter dude
santiago fernandez
is_a collest indian waiter i_ever seen
i_think_this dude knows what_he talking about when_he is explaining the_food
even he_gave me wierdest messurment of_the legnth of the_dosa that chef made in_the_kitchen
it_was unacceptable but belivable fact
lols to_my self
we_all happy about the_service and_the_prices but_they finally took_the shrim beriani put of_our bill by manager raj
keep his mustache perfectly fine
something dollarasss
went down_to kindof
bless me groupon
we will_go_back thats for_sure and_we_will send more_people
more sri lankans of_course
i_have_eaten_at this_place many_times and_it_has become my_favorite indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
indian_food can_get expensive but_this_is reasonable
the superb food way_out weights the_cost
i_try different_dishes each_time_i go_and have_yet_to be_disappointed
if_you_are_not sure what_to_order or_if you_will like_it
they have_a_lunch_buffet that_has a_pretty_good choice_for you to_sample and_again very_reasonable
meat_dishes are my_favorite but_they have_a_good portion of_vegetarian_dishes on_the_buffet too
dal_makhani is_my_favorite vegetarian dish
but_all are_good
they always_have different chutney's to_choose_from with salad_and fresh fruit
the_nan bread_is always_fresh and the_service_is_friendly
this_is_a rather new_restaurant and_as the_word gets out it will_get hard_to get_a_table on_friday or saturday_night dinner without a_wait
i_would_go now_and be_a trend setter by telling you friends
they_will love you for_it
every_time_i attend a conference in_las_vegas
i end_up at india_masala bar grill for a_truly wonderful dining_experience
rajesh
the owner's son always ensures you a_truly unique_and unforgettable culinary feast
we_love spicy_and the_chef's ability_to pay attention_to your level_of spicy is spot_on
the_menu_is truly reasonably_priced
the wine_list is exceptional and a_wide_variety_of dishes from_the north and_south of_india makes india_masala a lights out choice
you won't_be_disappointed in_the fragrant curries or special veggie_dishes
yes
a_truly wonderful dining_experience
just_had their_buffet that_had wonderful tikki_masala
a_wide range_of indian_dishes and various types_of rice
was certainly worth_it
it_was_a wonderful experience
we_ordered_a goat dish with_an onion_and ginger gravy
the pistachio kulfi was_amazing
homemade and_creamy
demetri was_a fabulous server
very_attentive_and caring
he even took_the time to_go through the_buffet_line and explain every_dish and_made helpful suggestions
the_goat dish_was one_of_them
the naan_bread_is fresh_and_hot
very_delicious
we_are foodies and_definitely will_be_back
and_will bring friends
thank_you for_the hospitality
i drive_by this_place all_the_time and_finally stopped_in
must thank yelp for the_deal
my roommate and_i_were hungry and_the fridge was_empty
search_for a_deal and boom
right_next_to home
we_came_in around dinner_time and_it_was fairly packed
after
i_am glad we_came_in when we_did
the_dinner rush came_in mins after we_did
service
outstanding
waiters very tentative to_us
but_i_felt that too many_different servers approached us_and made_it difficult_to keep track
our_waiter that took_our_order gave_me some_good recommendations since i_have_not had india food_before
our_first app was_the_chicken
different spices
i_thought dang
i'm gonna need lots_of water
turns out
very_flavorful
similar_to carne asada since_it_was served_with diced onions_and cilantro
our_main was the_masala_dosa dn the tandorri dinner
i_am first glad_i didn't go_with_the foot long dosa
would_have_been way_too much
i_loved_the dosa
very_spicy the_one_i got
but_also fresh
tandoori was_very_nice
plenty of_different meats
i_do feel that the_chicken_was dry as_well_as_the sausage
over cooked
this probably happen since the_kitchen was backed up
my roommate loved the_naan
so_great
that_he ordered another basket
we_got_our free_mango for checking via yelp
very_tasty drink
from the_name
i_first thought_it_was_a jelly
everything_was_great
but kitchen was overwhelmed by_the rush
waiters did apologized many_times
and_we listened into_the other_tables complaints and_all
i_felt that_they handled the neighboring table well since they_were upset by_a mistaken order
others were upset by the_wait
overall
i'll come_back
do want to_try_the_lunch_buffet
this_place_had some great_reviews so_i figured i_would_give the_buffet a_try
i_was_really not_impressed
first impressions were_good in the_door
it_is nicely_decorated and_clean
we_got_there about minutes_after the_buffet_had opened but_the_food looked_like it_had already been sitting_out a_while with skins on_the tops
we_enjoyed the_chicken_tikka_masala
rice_and_the naan_bread
but everything_else_was pretty disappointing
i_was also surprised they_had no desserts besides fruit
most indian_buffets i_go_to at least have rice_pudding
we_ordered mango_lassis as_well because_they didnt have cold chais
which didnt really taste_like mango
they_were like white
sour
runny greek yogurt drinks
honestly
i_will_not go_back
there_are much better places_in_town
perhaps sit down is a_better experience
i_have_been_to indian_restaurants throughout_the u
s and_this_place_is
by far
the_best
i'm serious
amazing
no_idea how this_place got any good_reviews
we went_for_the_lunch_buffet and_it_was awful
we_arrived right when the_place opened_and the_food_was_not fresh
already had_a skin on_it
the_buffet_was laid out horribly
the_rice_is in_the_back and_not_the front before the_entrees
there_were_no deserts besides fruit
wheres the kihr
we_tried almost every entree on_the_menu_and the_only_one that was_decent was the_chicken_tikka_masala
the_rest was either bland or sour
the_goat_curry had bones in_it
disgusting
also
avoid the_lassi at_all costs
it_was sour and_i_could barely get through a_few sips
this either means the_yogurt used had gone sour or they_do_not know_how_to make_a lassi
either way it sucked
as_you probably have already guessed
i will_not_be_returning
even_if they paid me
do yourself a_favor and drive two blocks down flamingo and_go to_mint instead
get_a strawberry or mango_lassi
it_will show you how a lassi is supposed_to taste
was_good for_the_price
quiet
poor_service
i_would_go all five_stars but yes
as i_am_not very_picky knowing you_can't get perfect with buffet_style
the_food could_be stirred up a_little
no big_deal folks
i_thought_it_was very_clean_and i_enjoyed_the atmosphere_of the_music and_how helpful everyone_was
i_am_an italian who knows good tasting_food
this stuff was_delicious
if people go_here expecting typical buffets with a_bunch_of treats and meats you_are crazy and_don't belong writing shitty reviews
i_have_seen this_place a_few_times as_it_is next_door_to my_fav pawn shop that my_friend works at
i_went_in and_enjoyed the_lunch_buffet had great_service_and will def go_back again
didn't know the_owners son works the_front but i_would_like_to pass along the thanks_for the hospitality and_service
keep up the_good work
super_friendly people_and someone is cooking up_some delicious_food in_that kitchen
came for_dinner on_a_tuesday
not_to crowded
had the_vegetable_korma which_was off_the hook
the wife_and_i went_for_dinner as_a spur of the_moment thing
upon walking_in
we_were impressed_with_the ambiance
it_was open and airy
we_were warmly greeted_and seated
at_the_table we_were our_server presented us_with a_basket_of delightfully light_and crisp chips accompanied by plum and mint_chutney dips
our_server_was dmitri
he_was great
he_was speedy without being pushy
he knew the_menu_and was willing to_accommodate special requests
we_ordered_the tilapia appetizer
the_portion could_have been an_entree for_two
the_fish was appropriately flaky without being dry
it_was_spicy without assaulting the taste_buds
i_had_to hold back so_that i_would_have room_for the_main_course
these did_not_disappoint
i_had_the_lamb curry_at spice_level
and my_wife_had the_chicken_masala at spice_level
the_chicken had_to_be special ordered
the_chicken normally used has the_red pink coloring to_it
this tends_to upset my wife's stomach
dmitri was_able_to convey this_to the_chef and the_chef nailed it
most_importantly
we_did_not have_to_wait any longer for_this modified meal
and_by the_way
the_chicken_was amazing
juicy
flavorful
and sliced just_right
the_lamb_was the_same
i_sampled both over_a nicely prepared bed_of basmati_rice
i_only regret not saving room for_dessert
next_time
another impressive thing_was the_menu selection
oftentimes indian_restaurants only serve regional dishes
this menu offers_a full culinary tour of_india
i_am_not one for buffets
but_i might try theirs just to_take_the full tour
the pricing was reasonable
had we not ordered_the tilapia and_mango_lassi
which_was extraordinary
our_meal with tip would_have_been about
that is_a_great dinner price just_about anywhere
but is_an exceptional value in_vegas
this_place hit_the grand slam for_me
ambiance
service
food
and price
my boss and_i just happened_to drive upon this_place after realizing we_were too early for_lunch at los
i_am_very open to_any type of_food_and not afraid_to try_new_things
that being_said i_am not_at_all familiar_with the assortment_of dishes_that i_tried or the_names nor am_i an_expert_on_indian food
but_i_can appreciate the_fact_that the_lunch_buffet_was very descriptive of_the what each_item was
the_waiter was_attentive_and it's_very cute inside
one_of_my_favorite dishes was_the fruit salad in_a sweet yogurt
i_can_say_that for
lunch_buffet with_a_lot_of choices i_will_be_back
i've gone here twice so_far and both_times i've_had exceptional service
there's_a deal from yelp you_can use to_get or off your_meal
i_love_their masala_chai
naan
their_chicken_tikka_masala and chicken_korma
they_also_have_a great_lunch selection as_well
definitely coming back_to_this_place
the_last indian_buffet i_went_to there_was so_much oil over_the aluminium containers
f
e
m
a
was_called to take_care of_the spill
the left_over saag
spinach
from previous nights had overcooked to_the_point
it_had turned brown and looked_like an alien
the_owners of india_masala
should be proud to_be calling themselves indian
since i_have_never_been to_an_indian_restaurant
which_is impeccably clean_and classy
the_buffet_is the_main attraction and not_a corner side show as_in other_indian_restaurants
last_time_i was_there
i_ate so_much i_had to_find_a tree to wind around_to digest the incredible food that_i_had at_the_buffet
not_to_mention it_is_not easy to_find_a tree in the_desert
they_also_have_a nice cozy bar_and i_have_a red_wine
preferably chilled since_the the_wine sommeliers
who go_to school of higher learning with student loans jauntily come_back_to tell the bartenders to_serve red_wine at
room temperature
room temperature in_las_vegas
happens to_be degrees fahrenheit
the bartenders who_are taught not_to argue with experts follow the dictum to_the tee
the red_wine has_to_be chilled to_taste good and_even a_cheap wine will taste good chilled and_most mere mortals drink cheap wine
not_to digress
i_have red_wine before_and during_dinner which gives you_a tremendous appetite
unlike beer
that makes_you full_and not_to_mention gives you buddha like belly
the_buffet_is not_only sight for sore eyes with over forty
north and_south_indian items
but_it a feast for_the palate
to_say_the least
the_buffet_is freshly cooked unlike chinese restaurants where they_serve left_over from the_previous week
the secret to good_indian_food is_authentic cooks
i_found out_from the_waiters that_they_have four north and_south_indian cooks
most_of_the indian_restaurants have_no cooks
but someone on_a tourist visa paying off their debts
the_service_is superb and the_ambiance_is embellishment to_the feast
there_is no_way anyone can_get this kind of_food_for the_price they_are charging and_this can happen only in_las_vegas the_buffet capitol of the_world
india_masala is_the indian_buffet capitol of_las_vegas
i_would_say this_is_the healthiest buffet food_in_las_vegas or anywhere
it_is time for_my weekly visit_to the capitol
we_stopped for_dinner last_night as it_had_been awhile since_we had_indian_food
since we_got_there right at pm which_is their opening time
the_place_was empty_and we_were_seated_immediately
water was_brought quickly_and we also_ordered regular iced_tea
the_server came_back and_said they_were_out_of regular iced_tea and they_only_had the sweetened raspberry tea
we_got that instead
for an_appetizer
we_ordered_the medhu wada
two deep_fried doughnuts made_from ground lentils
rice
and black pepper
with_it was_served three chutneys or sauces that added some to_the dryness of_the wada
the_sauces_were a_tomato based one
a soup
and a_coconut based one
the wadas were very_flavorful_and after chewing
you_got the_flavor_of the black pepper
when our_server went to_clear the_dishes
she asked_if_we wanted_to keep any_of_the chutneys
i_kept the_soup and_ate it
it_was_great
for_dinner
my_wife ordered the_garlic chicken and_i_ordered madras curry_chicken
spice_level on_a to basis
we also_ordered some_garlic_naan
dinner came with_basmati_rice
we_both liked our_meals
and_we_had garlic chicken to_bring home_for another_meal for_one of_us
the_garlic_naan_was good
for_dessert
we_shared a_dish of kheer
a_couple_of things keep_me from ranking the_place higher
on one_of_the hottest days this summer
the_restaurant_was very_warm
i_don't_like freezing in a_place either and_i always take_a denim long sleeve shirt with_me
i sure didn't need it as_i_was perspiring and_it_wasn't from the_curry
speaking of_that
is_not high enough for_a_good spice_level
their was_rather tame and_the_curry seemed_to be lacking some_of_the rich flavor it should_have
perhaps i'm spoiled by thai curry
i_think i_need_to stay away from indian_curry
the_kheer had_no pistachio chunks on_it which somewhat makes the_dish interesting
i_saw_the photo that westie w
posted and i_thought_that it_was_really enticing
the no regular iced_tea threw me
i was_going_to ask_them if_i_could have_some hot water and_a tea bag and a_glass_of ice
i_could_have made my_own
out_of iced_tea is_so lame
we bought_a yelp_deal which_is in essence a_off deal
this_place_is ok
but i_won't_be returning
there_are good good
fully supplied indian_restaurants_in_town
some_of_the_best_indian_food i've_had in_a_long_time
although very_spicy
i_usually have_the_buffet but tonight i_ordered off of_the_menu
i specifically wanted the_chicken chili dish_that i_tried at_one
only_one unfortunately
of_the buffets
never saw it_again at_the_buffet so had_to order_it for_dinner
it's listed under appetizers on_the_menu
that made_me think it_wasn't a_dinner sized portion
the_waitress asked_what spice_level
only_had that asked at thai restaurants
we_ordered medium
also_ordered saag_paneer at medium_spice
i_should_have asked_for everything to be_served together because the_chicken came out first
it_was fresh_and_hot
and_also blazingly spicy
damn
it_was_so flavorful_and quite_tasty with_an insane depth of_flavor
but so hot
couldn't_stop eating_it
the_saag was just_as hot but oh_so fresh
chunks_of tomato with strands of chive on top
could_have used a_little_more salt i_think
but_a_little too_hot
tongue went numb
which_i don't mind if the_food_is_outstanding
also_had rice_and_garlic_naan with meal
i_would_have given stars
but the_spice_level of_the_meal caused intestinal distress for a_few_days
which_i usually experience eating_indian_food
the spice_level_of the_food_at the_buffet_is far less than when_you_order off_the_menu
dining here reminded me_of_the first_time i_went_to shalimar
which i_thought_was some hot indian_food
i_love_indian_food
but for_some_reason gives me intestinal distress
india_masala is_another great_indian_restaurant in_my 'hood
mint
ghandi
india_palace
which i_am truly grateful for
will_go again_and lower the spice_levels
extremely tasty_food
careful with_the spice_levels
must_be unedible
i_came on_a_friday during_lunch and_had ate their_buffet for
classy
high ceiling
fancy wine glass for_water
nice silverware
great chicken_curry
not dry
solid variety
great_taste
no old film over curries
hint_of spice
to_go buffet same_price as lunch
they had_some chopped fruit
but didn't_look too appetizing
plates
naan
and vermicelli pudding was_enough to_put me in_a food_coma
zzzz
i'd chose mint if you_come solo and_want_to yolo
but_if you're
this_is_the_place since you_can use_the for value_and get the_mango dessert from check_in
clean_and classy restaurant
welcoming staff and_nice service
did_not really_like_the buffet
may be they_are showing less love in preparing lunch_buffet items
economical food_for_the ambiance_and good_for groups
its not_the_best biriyani you_will_get in_vegas
still i_will recommend shalimar for best biriyani
chicken_tikka_masala_with nan is_good
dosa_is ok
its not_the_best_indian_food out_there but can go once
first timer might like_it
this_has been_a frequent spot but recently the_food_quality has gone bad
these_guys used_to have_a_good dosa around
few of_us came_by dinner_and were_served dosas which_were very sour
old batter i_think probably a_few_days old
was_not a_good_experience at_all
we_said this_and it_didn't look_like the_chef cared much
atmosphere was_nice
very_clean
service_was atrocious
seated quickly
but waited forever just to_order
five tables_with patrons
four wait_staff just walking from_one place_to another doing nothing
as dishes would empty
we_placed them aside in_an organized manner
yet none_of_the wait_staff bothered to_clear them
we_actually had_a new dish brougt to_our_table and_they simply moved aside the empty used dishes and_left them on_our crowded table
ordered_the_tandoori chicken and_chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori was_not_as flavorful as i've_had at other_restaurants
tikka was_good
but_it barely fed two people
i_expected more for_the_price in terms_of quality_of food_and_service
a_real disappointment
will_not be a_repeat diner
nice spot to_grab cheap indian
with_a_great variety_of choices of northern and southern cuisine
portion_sizes_are generous and_full_of_flavor
lots_of coupons for checking_in
onion cilantro naan was_delicious_and filling
madras chicken_curry_was full_of_flavor and_the perfect_amount of_spicy
nice local spot
a_good escape from_the_strip with friendly_service
had an_amazing experience
i_ordered_the_chicken vindaloo_and my gf had the_korma
both_were perfectly spiced_and had amazing flavors
the_naan_was the_best_i've_ever_had
service_was_good_and prompt even though our_waiter had_the personality of_a neatly folded napkin
i_would_highly_recommend this_place_and get the_groupon deal
well_worth_it
staff very_nice
food_was_good
very_good food_and_great_service
they_made special non garlic non onion food_for my_mom
best_indian_food
we_had lunch_buffet delicious
chicken
bhuna gosht very_good_and perfectly spiced
service was_very_nice impressed ambiance
try the_best_indian_restaurant_in town
i m big_fan_of indian_food_and_this is_my_first visit_to india_masala bar_and grill
i_just want_to say wow
best indian_restaurant_in_vegas
tonight we_went_for_dinner
we_had sach a_wonderful experience
food_was_great
lamb madras curry_and garlic_nan
yum_yum
our_server_was pawan
he_is professional and_the_best
suggest us some_good wine_and food
thanks india_masala
the_lunch_buffet_was good
not_great but better_than_the other restaurants_around
hands_down_the_best_indian food_in_town
additionally some_of the_best_i've_ever_had
they_are super_nice here and_the_portions_are so_much_better than most_places
i_got_the lamb_curry my girl got the_lentil crepe
both_were absolutely incredible
definitely our top place_to_go now
this is_my_first yelp review and this_review
is_for vegetarian_dishes only
awesome
awesome
awesome
this_place came up_in yelp search
when_we_were looking_for indain restaurant for_dinner
on one_of_our vegas trips
the_food_here will not_disappoint you
and_worth it's value
we_had veggie_korma and sambar rice
both_were very
delicious
you have_an option_of setting the_spice_level to
for every_dish and_you_get what_you ask_for
service_was_very_friendly and_we_got complimentary
mango_lassi since their kitchen was little behind and_we_were waiting for_our_food
to be_served
overall very positive experience_and would_love_to go_back
when_we are back in_vegas
i_brought my_brother here_on_a recent visit_to vegas
he_has had_a_lot_of indian_food_in chicago
he said this_was_the_best indian_food he ever_had
we_had_a_great dinner starting with samosas that were_delicious
great_flavor and seasoning
we_also_had chicken_korma_and tikka
both fabulous
the_tikka is_my_favorite
we_enjoyed a very_tasty indian_beer
hayward's
and finished with home_made ice_cream
mango and pistachio
both real nice
i_went_back to_have_the lunch_buffet later in the_week and_found many new_dishes that i_really_enjoyed
the curry_chicken was_just divine
the_restaurant_is clean_and nicely_decorated with very_friendly servers and management
the_garlic_naan_is awesome
the levels of_flavor in_the_dishes i_tried were_so complex and fun to_eat
it_was_a pleasure to_eat_at india_masala
i_can't_wait_to visit_again
this_place_is_amazing
i went_for_the_lunch_buffet and_the scents draw you_in from the_moment you_walk through the_door
there_were so_many delicious options to_choose_from that_i_didn't even know_where to begin
the_naan_is the_best_i've_ever_had and i've_lived in_india
there_is something_about the_way the_flavors_of the_food blend together so perfectly
the_chef has created a_truly magical experience_for you
the_staff_is also very_friendly_and_attentive
i_really just_can't say_enough about_how fantastic this_restaurant_is
i_go_back anytime i'm in_the_area
this_place_is_great
i'm_always comparing indian_restaurants
i_always find something wrong but honestly speaking i_could_not find a_single thing wrong with_this_place
the_staff was_great_and caring
i overheard them trying to_find_a taxi for_some tourist
the_food_was_really_good
i_had paneer butter masala_and unlike other paneer dishes this_was not oily at_all and_the_naan_was soft
which i_love
i_hate crunchy and_chewy naan
i_took butter_chicken_and gobi_manchurian
which_is_a south_indian dish
home_for my_boyfriend_and he_loved it
i_am_a vegetarian so according_to my_boyfriend the_meat dish was_really_good
i_will_be_coming back for_sure
especially_when i'm feeling homesick
this_place_had one_of_the_best_indian food_i_have_had
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was amazing
a_good_variety for_their_lunch_buffet
and usually u get_a_good discount coupon on_yelp that helps
yelp_deal is a_big sham
i_did a togo of_food on_a_tuesday night and_the_guy at_the_counter says the_manager wont accept it
he agrees after i_read him the conditions and fine print from yelp
an item in my_order was_also missing
food_is_so so
there_are far better_places for_indian_food around
free_mango_lassi with checkin
that being_said
i had_the_lunch_buffet
the highlights for_me were the_chicken_tikka_masala
tandoori_chicken
garlic_nan
and keer
the_potato pancake was interesting as_well
similar_to what i've_had_in korean cuisine
but_this_one has a_bit_of sourness to_it
there_are different_types_of chutney_and also salad
some_of_the vegetarian_dishes were_tasty as_well
but_i'm disappointed there_was no paneer
overall it_is_good
service_is_excellent as the_staff_was_very_friendly and_helpful
i_think_we had yelp checkins and_they_were so_happy to_give us_our free_mango_lassi
so_much so they_even gave us an_extra one
there_is_also pineapple n cantaloupe for_those who like to_end their meal with_fresh fruit
the_meat_dishes like lamb kebab chicken we're not_that_great
paneer_tikka_masala
plenty of gravy but_only cubes paneer
chana_masala was_ok
naan_was_fresh soft
disclaimer
i_haven't_tried the_food_here yet
not_sure i_will bother
the star review_is_for_the crap service
if_i ever return to_eat
i_will update accordingly
i placed an online order_for pick up through eat
was quoted minutes
i_get there a_few_minutes later than_that and_was told_that the_order was_not made due_to_the chef being busy
host says the_chef can_make it now
but it_will_be another_minutes
i'm on a_lunch break from work
already blew through most_of_it driving there
no thanks
canceled
really irritated that no_one thought to_let me know the_order would_be delayed
wasted enough_of my time that i_couldn't go elsewhere
i understand shit happens
but let me know so_i_can plan around it
not cool
india_masala is an_indian_restaurant near unlv's campus on flamingo
the_parking_lot does get filled because a combination_of india_masala
the_various business around
and_the small parking_lot
i'm impressed_with_the interior
it is_very_nice_and a_huge improvement from_what was_there
only_a_few years_ago
that being_said it_is_very nice_inside but how does the_rest stack up
well i_came_here_with my_usual large_group of co_workers and_they_were more_than accomendating
we_all did the_lunch_buffet_which was_only
the_same_price as mt
everest
in_comparison buffet wise
i_do perfer mt
everest a_lot_more because_they had_more selection
flavor
and_better quality in_the non salad_and non dessert items but india_masala is_an ok substitute
so_they don't_have_a large_selection on their_buffet
their_rice dish wasn't mixed well
large patches of non mixed rice_was found throughout
the curry_dishes were_very running
if they_weren't meant to_be running
but_their desserts
the free_mango_lassi after check_in and_yogurt tapioca pudding looking things with fruits were_all_very delicious
their meat_dishes and regular garlic naans_were about the_same
customer service_was_excellent
when a_few_of us decided_to use our free lassi check_in offers and they_gave more_than enough it became awesome
there_are_better indian_restaurants_in_the area
the_food in_the_buffet were alright but_not good_enough for_me_to be a_fan_of
maybe i'll come_back_for dinner or_not do the_buffet
they_do_have a happy_hour from pm pm for with a_drink list and off selected appetizers
came_with my vegan dining partner
we_came at_lunch and_they_had only the_buffet_but we told_them we_were vegan so_they let us order_off_the_menu
although_we announced we_were vegan
i_ordered_a chai_tea
and_they brought_me a chai with creme
so_it_was quickly exchanged for_a plain black tea
the_spice was a_tiny heavy for_a of
so use caution there
very_yummy
easy menu_and good_value
very_close_to unlv
worth_a try
my_friend recommended this_place
so we_ended_up checking it_out mid week for_some lunch_buffet action
place was_fairly busy
wait_staff were friendly_and we_were_seated_immediately
the_food
this_is where_they lose stars
while the_curries_are ok and_all
the choices are very_limited
and rather uninspiring
the_meat items_were generic
altho the_butter_chicken_was quite delish compared_to the_rest
but_i've had_better
no beef lamb goat seaffood options
a_bit vanilla if_you_ask me
the_garlic_naan though was_amazing
some_of_the best_naan i've_had_in recent years
def recommend getting those
customer_service_was superb
only_wish the_curry choices and_quality were_a_bit better
excellent_food
loved_the tava fish_and chicken karahi
i_love_this_place because_it's relatively cheap
especially_with the_groupon
and_i_love buffets
lunch_buffet
plus half off w groupon
i_just_wish there_were a_little_more vegan variety
all_of_the vegan food kind of_just compliments the_naan_bread instead_of being awesome by itself
but to_be fair i_think that's how most_indian dishes_are supposed_to be
still really_delicious
however
i_was never fond of their_lunch desserts
they're either kind of weird or boring or both
also
i'm_not sure_if this_was an isolated incident
but the_last_time_i went
the_saag
spinach mustard greens curry
was_way
way too_salty
i_actually love salty food and_most green things
but that_had to_be_a mistake
hopefully it_was_just a fluke
despite my complaints
i_strongly recommend_this_place for vegans and meat_eaters alike
this_place_is always tasty
and_i leave completely stuffed every_time
india_masala on e flamingo rd went_here_with friends_for dinner
excellent customer_service
great_indian_food
must eat
tamarind rice_and bisi bele bath form rice dishes
gobi_manchurian is_a_must_try
be_careful when u order the_quantity they_serve is_more
we_went_back to hotel room with_lots_of togo boxes and_the bill_was in
three digit figure
no_real complaints
i_have_been_to india_masala on s las_vegas blvd too but_that one_is definitely_not good to_try
very_good
i_was_looking_for something off_of the_strip_and find myself very_pleased
it_was_pretty quiet at
pm
the_staff_was extremely polite_and attentive_and the_food_was_great
i_had shrimp tikka_masala along_with the_variety_of nan
i'm happy i listened to the_waitress when_she told_me was
i'm on fire hot
was_spicy but_not_too over the_top for_me
if_you_like garlic_nan you'll be_happy if_you_order it_here
as_soon_as_we reached vegas we_were in_search_of some comfort
authentic_food
while_we_were browsing this on_yelp we stumbled upon india_masala bar_and grill
as weird as it_may seem they_had one_of_the excellent rasam
a soup
i've ever_tasted
dinner_was as_well a_buffet spread with neat array_of items ranging_from south_indian to north_indian
surprisingly the sambhar
rasam
pakoras_were mind blowing and_mango_lassi was_nothing short_of stupendous
garlic_naan_was so soft_and flavourful
the_front desk staff_was_very cheerful and_attentive
the_buffet price was_pretty kind on_the wallet too
i_believe if you take some buffet_food to_go its a_couple_of dollars cheaper
but_i've no_idea what you_may be_able_to fit in_a box in_their wide_selection_of delicacies
so this_review isn't necessarily about_the_food
the_food_is fine
good_enough comfort_food with_an adequate selection
this_is more about the_service
i_used_to frequent this_place at lunchtime because_it's decently priced
on weekdays
on_weekends
on_top_of_that
i'm a_student so_i sometimes get two for_one discount coupons which_is_nice because_i definitely live on a_student budget
let me just_say that_this pricing is_very loose
it_didn't take me long_to realize that the_price_is rarely
it's almost always
for_one reason or another
for example
the_restaurant_is very_busy
it's_a
holiday
of some_sort
or my_personal favorite
the_manager told_me to raise the_price today
hahaha goodness
ok then
we_actually made_a game of guessing what ridiculous reason we_were going_to_be given for higher prices
because of_course pm on_a_tuesday merits an increase in prices
right
i had_a_few coupons for buy one get_one free
any day_of the_week
between_the hours of_and
well of_course that's too simple
it_wasn't until after_we finished_eating that_the
server
hostess
someone who appeared_to work there
pointed to a_tiny yellow sign stuck to the_counter that_said
no coupons on_weekends
and_she then proceeded_to giggle and_say sorry and mutter something_about
well managers said so
i'd had_it
i_was done
it's_just a joke of_a_restaurant
and_having nonexistent service_from start to_finish
watching employees hang out on_their phones and read_the newspaper at_the_bar
no thank_you
i_work in_a_restaurant
and_let me_tell you
i_wish my job was_that easy
thankfully
not all is lost
delhi opened right down_the_street
their_food_is always_fresh and_flavorful and_the_staff_is fantastic
they remembered us after_our second_visit and are_always so_excited to_see us_and welcome us
on_top_of_that
their_lunch_buffet_is
every_day
no exceptions
heck
i'd gladly give them
and_i_really could care less about coupons
i_want_to see_them do well
such_a better choice than india_masala
the_saag was_ok
but lacking the strong layering of_flavor that i_expect in this_dish
also
the chunks_of garlic were_all different sizes
some were_about inches
the chopping is_so sporadic
and obviously rushed
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was super greasy
waaaay too_much ghee
or_maybe even oil
the_chicken in the_tikka_masala_was grainy and powdery
and_there_was so little of_it
odd
we_ordered from eat
where_it said_that they're delivery fee was free
then when_we checked out
our receipt said_it_was a charge
they said_that india_masala charges for delivering
far away
we_are literally blocks from_them
and that_is considered far
what's close
if_you_live in_the_same strip_mall as the_restaurant
our_order took an_hour and minutes to_arrive
we_will not_be ordering from them_again
new disclaimer
i_get extremely cranky when_my blood sugar drops
so
i_did go_back
to_the_lunch_buffet
based_on_the buffet alone
i_think i_would_like_to go_for_dinner at_some_point
i_thought the_food_was exceptionally good
not_just
for_a_buffet
but in_general
i_did the_lunch_buffet_for takeout
they are_generous with_the containers
and separately packaged naan
so i_was_able_to try pretty much some_of everything
and_lots_of some_things
the_selection_is small
but_the bases were fairly covered
i_knew going in_that i_wouldn't find samosas
but_i_still missed them
there also wasn't any pakora
and a_few_other standard items i_was_surprised not to_see
still
what they_do_have is solid
the_tandoori_chicken_was basic
but_well prepared and_moist
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was exceptionally good
as_was_the fish_curry they_had
to_the best_of my knowledge
and please
feel free to message me if_i'm wrong
india_masala is_the_only spot offering_a takeout option_for their_buffet
as you_might know from_my earlier review
my time is_extremely limited on weekday afternoons
it's_good to_know that_i_could pop in
fill a_few containers
pay
and be_on my_way in a_few_minutes with enough delicious_food for_both lunch_and_dinner
i love_the_food at_this_restaurant
we_have normally been to_the_other branch of_it which_is in riviera but we_thought of checking this_one out
i'm_not_a buffet person and prefer ordering for ourself separately
we_tried_the chhole masala which_came out beautifully good n great level_of spice
which_i certainly liked
other stuff like the_chicken_curry n aaloo tikki chaat and_the complimentary lassi which we_got from_our check_in made_our dinner even_more special
next_time we_tried andhra masala_dosa and indian_and esp dosa was_great_and to_add
the chutney's were probably the_tastiest i'vs ever had_in_vegas
we_even got_the for deal which added_to our pleasure
a_must go place_for all indian_food lovers
never going_to this_place_again
my niece husband myself were seated_right away
made_us the nd set of customer in_the_restaurant
waiter_asked if_we_wanted anythng to_drink and all_of_us told him we_all just wanted water waiter didn't_look like_he wanted_to that asked_us back
just water
waiter leaves came_back poured us water
aftr a_couple_of mins
waiter comes back asked_if_we were ready_to order
my_husband was_ready to_place his order my niece who just_had late_lunch fr work was_not goin to_order anythng i_wasn't ready_to place mine
neithr any of_us three on_our_table really hv been to_an_indian_restaurant
took_me slightly longer to_place my_order than my_husband
then told waiter i_wasn't ready
after a_couple_of mins
waiter comes back i_asked_if the_dish i_was_looking getting can b made not_spicy waiter right away said
no
ok
it's an_indian_restaurant they'r known for_their spices so then_i asked which vegetable dish did_not come
creamed
waiter mentioned about three
i_picked mixed_vegetables my_husband then places his order too
soon_as_we placed our choices
waiter leaves our_table then aftr bout a min comes back said_no mixed_vegetables
omg for_an_indian_restaurant who's menu s almost vegetarian
no mixed_vegetables
i_then change my_order which_comes w nan_bread
waiter_asked if bread w butter or plain
i_said butter on_the side waiter stops writing said_that they_didn't
do butter on_the side looked_like my request was_too difficult
he said i_can just give u plain bread
i_said ok just bring me_some butter
waiter said he's been_there a_year hv not heard such
i_asked waiter to_ask their kitchen he tells me they'r busy
there_was_only three tables now_that occupied out_if i'd say least tables
they hv the_bread
now it's_a matter of having butter or_not if their nan_bread came eithr plain or already buttered
he_could hv said they_didn't hv butter which_would b nxt to_not since butter s almost in evry pantry fridge
but instead waiter_was saying they hv not served plain nan_bread w butter on_the side
at_the_end my simple request of nan_bread butter on_the side aftr so_long of_a conversation w the_waiter gets on_our_table along w other_things we_ordered we also_ordered plain_rice which didn't_get to_our_table aftr we wer almost done since our_waiter forgot we_ordered rice only found_out aftr checking hw we wer doin as_we wer getting almost done
their_chicken is bomb
i_absolutely_love it there
as_a foodie
this_is_by_far one_of_my_favorite indian_restaurant_in_vegas
also try_the briyani
it_is infused with amazing flavors
flavorful yet something was bit off
couldn't quite put my finger on_it but some_things were_just too_spicy too greasy_and too empty in_the pan
waited but_they wouldn't fill it
they_had lots_of selections so_i really didn't_have_to try_everything
i_liked most_of_the_dishes i_tried
the_waitress_was nice but hostess had bit_of an attitude
oh_well
i_don't maybe_i was sensitive on_this day
decent_food but very_very expensive
try_the south_indian_food very good_stuff
avoid dosa
i_came_here for_the_lunch_buffet on_a_weekday
the_food_and customer_service were_both decent
but_i'm giving_them one star_for_the management's ridiculous antics
i_had_a coupon_for a_free buffet_which i'm guessing they tried_to compensate for by tacking on gratuity to a_party_of five
is_that even legal
there_were_no signs on_the_menu or by the_cash_register to justify this
the_host didn't bother to_tell me_that gratuity was added_to my total
and_the receipt wasn't itemized
my receipt only listed a
pre tip total
when they_had in_fact already added gratuity to_that price
i had_to_ask why the_total was_so high
and_that's how_i found how that_i_was already charged gratuity
they're just trying_to gyp their_customers
no thanks
i_was totally disappointed_with this_restaurant
food_tasted horrible and_there_were not many_options
the_staff also did_not respond well when_we told_them the_food_was_not hot enough
overall
i_wouldn't visit_this_place again
i_tried_the lunch_buffet_and i_was_not the_least disappointed
the_food_was_delicious and_the waiters_were very_attentive
the_buffet offers about eight different_dishes
which may seem like a_small selection
but the_quality_of_the dishes leaves you more_than satisfied
i_have_been_to buffets with_a greater selection_of dishes
but_the_chicken and_vegetables are_not as fresh and_i end up_with_a stomach ache
the complimentary naan_bread alone is_worth_the visit
the_restaurant_itself
the_food
and_the_price are right
a_must go_to restaurant
always love a_good_indian buffet
and_they deliver that here
fresh
tasty
could be_a_little spicier
and_i_know it's hit_or_miss with other_indian_buffets
but samosas would_be_a nice addition
otherwise it was_a_good_experience
and_would certainly go_back again
we_had_a very_tasty meal here_tonight
the_mango_lassi had full mango flavor
yummy
the chapati and sauces_were the_best_i_have_had
and_yes i_have_eaten indian_food_before many_times although_not in_india
but in_london
we ordered_chicken_tikka dosa
goat_curry
basmati_rice
and_naan
it_was_our_first time_having a_dosa
not_sure that_we have_seen this_on a_menu before
but we_are glad_that we_tried it
if_you_have never_had one_and you_like crepes
this_is_a_must have
of_course
the_sauces that went_with it were_just delightful
bursting with_flavor in every_bite
the_curry_was also very_flavorful_and so_was_the wonderful naan
we_order the_rice so the_goat_curry had something to_sit on
for two_of_us
we_had way too_much_food but managed_to eat most_of_it
service_was very_attentive_and pleasant
wonderful experience and_great_food
a_restaurant can_be judged by it's chutneys
this statement holds very true for india_masala
loved_the_food
highly_recommend aloo paratha
fish_curry and yellow dal
dosa_was fresh_and_delicious as_well
had their_buffet during a_recent trip_to_vegas and came_back extremely dissatisfied
will_not_go back there_again
the_selection_was small
the_food did_not taste good
their rasam was_over the_top spicy
i_eat super_spicy but_this_was insane
and_was floating in oil
the_owner host told_me that_he had_never tasted rasam before_and thought_that the base of_the rasam was oil
lol
they_need to_get_a new chef who really knows how to_cook indian_food
mini dosa was_good
but the_only chutney they_had was made_of tomato and_was tasteless
seriously how_can anyone ruin tomato chutney
they_charge
for their_buffet
such_a waste of_money
you_pay just_a_couple bucks more and_you_get excellent and_super tasty_food at_mint
i_dont know when they_opened
but_we_were driving through and_it said now open
having been_to swagat many_times
still love swagat
this_was_a welcome change and just_a new_place to_try_some desi food
really_really_good
very_happy for having stopped by with_a_friend for_lunch
very_affordable and_hot yummy food
and the_quantity was_more_than_enough we_were quite stuffed_and content
the_food_in itself_is yummy we_ordered_the vegi thali_and it_came_with four big naans
a_side_of_rice and three veggies plus kheer and raita
we_also_had an option_of either soup or salad to_start off_with
this_is_one place i_will_be stopping by often
ambience is_nice_and staff_is_very_friendly
was a_pleasure to_dine here_and i_will_definitely be_back_for_more and be_sure_to recommend_this_place_to friends
this_was_one_of_the_best indina restaurants i_have_ever been too
my_girlfriend recommended_the place_after her coworker visited the_restaurant for_lunch
the_food_was was_very_flavorful and the_service_was_very welcoming
i couldn't_stop stuffing my face with_the delicious_food
the_chicken_tikka_masala is_a_great favorite
my two kids
ages and
eat_it like_it's ice_cream
the_restaurant_was hopping
a_great new_indian_restaurant on the_west_side
great_indian
my_favorite part_of this_restaurant_is their lunch_menu
they_don't do buffets
it_is_so affordable
so_you_can take multiple items home to_try
for_under
my_hubby and i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala
shrimp_vindaloo
lamb_biryani
rice dish
garlic_naan
plan naan
and extra raita
all meals come_with their cumin toasted basmati_rice
we_have enough_for at least another_meal and half
i_am_so excited they_opened
haven't ate in yet
dinning room looks nice_and staff_is always wonderful during counter service
embarrassed to_say_i am new_to_indian cuisine
that being_said the_waitstaff here was_incredible in helping me decide by making accurate comparisons
the_flavors keep your mind guessing and_your palette interested
they_get an_a from_me on portions
affordability
knowledgeable waitstaff and_flavor
i'm hooked
i_stopped at dhaba for_the_first_time this week
on the_good side
the_restaurant looks very_good and_the_staff_is courteous_and efficient
also
our naan_bread_was delicious
on the_bad side
the very_bad side
the_lamb_vindaloo was inedible
it appeared_to be canned tomato_soup
slightly spiced_and heated with_some lamb dropped in
terrible
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was barely passable
i_think_the sauce also came from_a jar
at least it_tasted_like it
i_cannot recommend_this_restaurant for_anything other_than naan
if_you_want indian
any_other indian_restaurant_in_town would_be better
indian_food is_one_of_my absolute favorite cuisines for_its flavor
spice
and creativitiy
but the_price_of it versus my grad student budget makes_it a_special treat only
after seeing dhaba's affordable lunch_menu online
i_had_to_try this_place_out
i'm incredibly happy i_did
surprisingly quiet for noon on_a_saturday
but_it just meant that_my food_came to_me faster
the
lamb_curry with_basmati_rice was savory_and delicious
medium_spicy was_definitely medium
so as a_spice enthusiast
i'm getting hot next_time
for_the_price
i certainly didn't expect a_choice_of soup or salad with my_entree
but ta da
i_chose the lentil_soup
while it_was_a_very small portion
it_was_really_good
with carrots
vegetables
and_lentils in_a light broth
the strawberry lassi arrived with whipped cream_and a cherry on top
like_a strawberry shake
but_one sip revealed a_great blend_of strawberry with_a yogurt tang
it went really_well with my_meal
last but_not least
the_naan
garlic_naan
it's my weakness
and_this_is some of_the_best_i've_had
got me a_basket full_of hot_naan crammed full_of chopped garlic
cilantro
and ghee
and it_was_wonderful
so_for
i_got_a meat curry
soup
lassi
and_naan
there_are indian_restaurants that_would charge me_that for the_entree alone
and_the_quality_of_the food_was the_same
if_not better
dhaba_is definitely worth_a_visit
my_husband_and_i were_in middleton in september for_the midwest tandem rally and happened in_for_dinner after_a day_of riding
we_were absolutely delighted with the_food_and_service
we_were_told they_had just_opened that week_and sure enough
i_couldn't find any place to_give_them the glowing review they deserved
fast forward to november and we_went_back for_a weekend
get_away
from_the twin cities and had_dinner again here_at dhaba
still one_of_the best meals we've_had out_and a_real bargain too
i_actually signed up_for yelp just to_give_this restaurant a_review
excellent_food
best_indian in_madison that i've_had
nice_place
great_service
awesome prices
dhaba indian_bistro is_so_good
i've_only ordered_take_out so_far
but the_dining_room looks nice
i_love all_their choices of_naan
the_samosas_and their many_vegetarian choices
i'm able to_spend about_and stretch it_to two or three meals
they let you_choose how_spicy you_want curry_dishes
which_is_nice
flavors_are vibrant and so_good
i_might have_to_order from_them for supper tonight just thinking_about_it
definitely_worth_a try
a_lovely oasis of elegant
yet personal
table_service in_a mecca of fast_food lunch joints and chain restaurants by greenway plaza
extensive_menu selection
delicate spicing
refined presentation all served by waitstaff who clearly know their_menu and_are enthusiastic about_it
attentive_service
yet unobtrusive no
hi
i'm patel
your new best friend
business just genuine care and grace about your experience
all dishes are_served promptly
no worries
office park crowd
in lovely crockery and china
with starched cloth napkins and substantial silverware no sporks here creating an atmosphere_of grace and relaxation even during a_busy lunch_hour
quiet enough_to hold a conversation without employing lipreading skills another plus
no typical_indian buffet scene to ensure you'll get_the flu bug either
dhaba also offers take_out menu to consider for_dinner when commuting home
best basmati_rice in_town all very_reasonably_priced
so_glad we_found a_good_indian_restaurant in_our area
woo hoo
we_order the_fish masala
medium_spicy
and_the chole with_garlic_naan and_it_is soooo delicious
the prices_are_reasonable and_the_food_is so_flavorful
also they_are_very quick when_we call to_order takeout so we_have_been very_pleased
for_all_the people stating that this_is_the_best_indian_food in_madison
i_can_only assume that_they_have not ever_been_to maharaja
or swagat
maharaja is_the_best_indian_restaurant in_madison
and we_have_been going_there for_years
but to_keep an open mind
we_have_tried dhaba twice in_the_past month
first of_all
the_place itself_is nicely_decorated
and_the_service_is excellent
the_waitstaff are polite_and attentive
and there_are_plenty_of them
but_the_food_is just_not that_good
other_than the_naan
every entree comes_with either soup or salad
we_have gotten their lentil_soup both_times
which_is buttery
thin
and tastes very_little like lentils
however
it's not_bad
just_not very interesting or lentil y
for main_courses
we_have_had the_chicken shahikorma and_the_chicken_tikka_masala
as_well_as_the spinach
ie palak
paneer
a combo of spinach_and farmer's cheese like cubes
and_spinach aloo
spinach with_potatoes
the_first_time_we tried_the_chicken shahikorma
i_was suspicious that_the base of it_was_actually canned tomato_soup with_a_few spices added
seriously
it_was_a_very thin sauce
with cut up chunks_of nicely cooked chicken_breast in_it
but the_sauce_was not_like any shahikorma i've ever_had
and it_was_not interesting
the_second_time we_came we had_the_chicken_tikka_masala
and strangely enough
it_had the_exact same sauce as_the shahikorma
the two_dishes should_not
repeat not
have the_same sauce
and_the_chicken_tikka should_have been made_with chicken_cooked in the_tandoor oven
but_there_was no evidence that it_had_been
we_felt a_little ripped off that_the two_dishes use the_same sauce
they_should not
the_spinach dishes_were ok
except the potatoes_in the_spinach aloo were undercooked as_in crunchy
i didn't_eat them
the_naan_is great
i admit
but the_rest just is_not_that good
seriously
if folks want really_good_indian
go_to maharaja and get_the_chicken shahikorma or tikka there
we_decided_to_try it because_of_the good_reviews it's_been receiving and_we_were very_impressed
i_don't pretend to_be an_expert_on_indian food
but_this_is the_best_i've_ever_had
i_used_to go_to swagat
which_is also_good
and there_were_a_few indian_places_i frequented when i_lived_in denver
but_this blew them away
the_garlic_naan_bread is_a_must
we're still craving_it today
i_ordered_the_chicken_tikka_masala on a_recommendation and it_was_awesome and_my_wife ordered the_beef mushroom which_was_also excellent
we ordered_take_out and_the_food_was ready very quickly_and it's_also very_reasonably_priced
plus
they_give_you_a discount if you_pay in cash
we_have_a year old_and are_always looking_for_good take_out options
dhaba might_have just jumped to the_top_of the_list
let me start by saying i'm indian and_a bratty snob when_it_comes_to indian_food
my_family is punjabi like the_family that owns the_restaurant
so_i very_much appreciated the mostly north_indian menu
food
yum
we_have the non_veg appetizer platter
so_good
keema samosa was_one_of_the_best i've_had
we_ordered malai_kofta
chicken_tikka_masala_with garlic_and chicken naan
we later got_some saag
spinach dish
and kheer
naan we_ended_up trying garlic
chicken and_plain_naan
all kind were_great
malai_kofta best_i've_had_in madison
i've tried_a_few other_places and_they just_don't hit_the_spot the_way this_one did
chicken_tikka_masala it's the_only chicken_dish i_think_is ever worth ordering at_an_indian_restaurant
this_dish was literally designed for indian_restaurants
it's_not authentic to_india rather great britain
so_i_don't bother with anything else
dhaba's was reallllllly good
saag my_mom licked the bowl she_was so in_love_with it
kheer i'm_not someone who usually likes kheer but we_had_some at_the_end and_i stole my mom's because_it_was just the_perfect balance_of sweet_and creamy
we_ordered at_a spice_level and found_it perfect
i'm_not someone that loves spicy_food
ie
hyderabi
goan
pakistani food
i_can't handle you
however
i_do like_some heat
so_the was honestly just perfect_for my_mom
sister and myself
my_mom was_even having a_little_bit_of a hardtime handling that
but she's been cooking without much spice for the_past year
restaurant decor
i_really_like how they've decorated it_and appreciated the folk artwork and punjabi music_playing in_the_background
totally like a_real 'dhaba'
dhaba's are the_indian version_of fast_food joints
you pull over on the_side_of the_road to_a usually sheltered tented area
at least in punjab enjoy_the whatever deep friend sloppy delicacy you_are offered
usually some_sort_of comfort_food
back_to_the review
overall this_place_is awesome
i'm totally planning to_cater for one_of_my wedding events from_them
p
s
if_you_like taste_of_india on monroe street or brookfield fox valley
the_owners family runs those locations as_well
two thumbs_up
this_place_is an_amazing find
only_one issue is_that_it_is not open monday
great_food
staff is_fantastic and_friendly
came for_lunch on_a_weekday
it_was_pretty busy
but_the_service_was still quite_good
the_menu_is quite large
with_lots_of great curry options
chicken_madras was_excellent
but the_cheese_naan wasn't great
this_is_probably the_best_indian_restaurant i've_been_to
i_would_definitely_recommend it
i_got_the chicken_tikka_masala and_it_was_delicious
affordable prices and_good_service as_well
they_were_very helpful for explaining what a_lot_of the_food_on the_menu_was
i_have_had nothing but amazing_food and fabulous service_here
my_favorites include the_tandori mixed_grill
chicken_madras
and chicken_tika_masala
be_sure to_try_the peshwari_naan a_sweet kick_to the_traditional naan
you_will quickly become a_regular
on a_recent search for_a_great local_indian restaurant_we discovered two within a_mile of_our house
both are_great but_this_one is_our new_favorite
easy_to miss from the_street
it's_worth_the search to_find
we_have_been back twice_and service_has always_been prompt_and personable
the_food_is equally fantastic
my_husband is a_huge_fan_of their tandori_chicken and myself love_their mango_chicken and_chicken_tikka_masala
the
dinner_for_two
is_a_great deal_and a_fun way_to_try a_few entrees too
the naan_was_also great_as_well as their lentil_soup
we_are looking_forward_to going back
absolutely the_best_and most_authentic north_indian
mughalai
tandoori
food_i_have_ever eaten
this_is_a_great place
run_by folks who seem_to_have been in_the_restaurant business for some_time
more then anything else
the_owners_are involved in_the_kitchen
and_that shows in the_quality_of preparations and serving
highly_recommend_this_place to_anyone_looking_for good north indian_cuisine
beautiful afternoon sitting outdoors at dhaba
the_lunch_specials sounded so_good_that i_had_a chicken lunch_special and my_wife_had the_vegetarian
both_were made_to medium spiciness and were_served promptly
cold indian kingfisher beer went_well with_both
aaa service
we_sat outside_and enjoyed_the day
what a_disappointment
the_lunch menu_is cheaper because_they mix in stale food
don't_be surprised if you discover stale pieces_of meat_in your curry
dry
leftover rice_or undercooked bread_and appetizers
guess thats why its more affordable than the_dinner_menu
to_be fair we have_found the_food_to_be surprisingly_good at_other times
kid friendly_too
but_its a hit_or_miss
depends on_the day_and what_you order
the_quality_of_the_food is terribly inconsistent
ice creams are ok
other desserts not_so_much
i_was born in new york and i've_been_to authentic indian_restaurants so_this doesn't come close
the asian lady at_the reception is cold_and stand offish
everyone else is_warm_and if not_for_the occasionally well_made dishes
i_doubt i_would_go_back
amazing_service and turn around time_for orders
very_pleasant staff and_the_food_is incredible
a_gem in_madison
i_ordered from this_restaurant like three weeks_ago through_the grubhub delivery service
for my_boyfriend i_ordered_the_chicken shahi korma and_it_was decent
he_did not_like it too_much and for_me i_ordered_the paneer_masala which supposedly comes_with cottage_cheese
onions
tomatoes
raisins_and cashews
they call it_a royal delight
and_all i_got was
a royal fiasco
it_was_a container with_a red liquid
which_i imagined it_was_a can or_two of tomato paste with cubes_of cottage_cheese
i_couldn't believe_it
not_even one raisin or cashew or_anything similar_to a_veggie or nut
i spent for_that
as_you_can imagine
i_will_never ordered_from that place_again
the_maharaja restaurant it_is expensive also but they_really do_have nice flavorful dishes_with veggies on_them
all potential for disappointment gets checked at the_door and_never makes_it inside
the_friendly owners
portion to price ratio and succulent entrees make this_place star awesome
a_must for anyone who enjoys indian_food
this_time while_i waited
the_owner told_me all_about uttarayan
one_of india's many major festivals
i_brought home the_chicken_tikka_masala
wife's favorite
and the_chicken_vindaloo
along_with_the veggie appetizer sampler
the_samosas_are a personal fav and_i get those every_time
if for no other reason than the_sampler of_sauces they_serve with_them
nirvana for_me would mean being dipped in those sauces
please don't_eat me though
the_pakoras
fried veggies in_a hummus batter
are_also perfectly dippable and probably taste slightly better_than i_do
for_entrees
i_ordered_the masala mild
but_would step that up_a notch next_time
the_vindaloo_was medium plus spicy_and perfect just spicy_enough to_make my forehead sweat but_not so_spicy as_to dominate the_flavor
the_chicken in_both entrees was_tender white_meat
expertly cooked
eat_here
you won't regret_it
i_just died and_went to_indian_food heaven
seriously though
if_i_were on death row
that_would suck but
this would_come a very_close second to_my family's homemade cincinnati chili
in_the_us it's_very difficult_to find the_quality_of indian_food_you will_find in the_uk
yes
the_uk where i_believe chicken_tikka_masala is_going_to_be declared the national dish over fish_and chips
you_cannot turn a corner without smelling the_indian_food bliss slap you in_the face
and_finally
i_have_found an_indian_restaurant_that has met their match in_the_us of 'merica
dhaba indian_bistro is ah mazing
so what_was for_dinner you_ask
lobster madras with_garlic_naan
no
lobster madras
a_little spicier and_more flavorful in_my_mouth
was_not on_the_menu
but_they made_it
no questions asked
i_knew the_vindaloo_was too_spicy and the_masala too weak for_my buds so
they_just smiled and brought_out_a beautiful dish full_of those indian flavors i_have missed so_much
too_bad they're not in_my hometown
i'd_be there once_a_week
minimum
i_think i_could_eat here_every day_and not_get bored
the_staff_is informative and_helpful
the_samosas_are brought with_a sampler of_sauces
each one is_fantastic
it_is mouth_watering good
the_garlic_naan_is very_tasty
my husband's co_worker ate_here everyday for months while she_was here_for business
i_can_see why
the items_on_the_menu are_delicious
this_place_is_a must for anyone wanting_to experience the_best_indian_food_in_town
the_food_is_really high_quality and tastes great
on the_weekend
you_can_get_a vegetarian thali for
that gets you
soup
three different vegetable_dishes
several pieces_of naan
delicious rice
desert
now
this_is_not your buffet variety food
the_thali is freshly cooked
and_you_can tell
the_spices and flavors_are sublime
you_are offered mild
medium or hot
as desired
so
instead_of feeling_like you_have_to get_your money's worth at_a
buffet
try_this_place out
if you_pay cash
they_give_you_a discount
came recommended_by a_friend
the_staff_was_very attentive
and the_food_was_delicious
this_was_my_first_time i've had_indian_food
so_i_was skeptical
but_this_place was_so_good
i_took_my boyfriend
he_also loved_it
my_favorite items_on_the_menu are the_garlic_naan_and chicken_curry
i_am_not a_huge_fan_of indian_buffet since the_quality tends_to suffer at buffets
this_one_is a_welcome change
we_usually do carry outs on weekend
paneer_masala is_very_good
their breads are extremely tasty_and fresh
each bread had_two big pieces so two people can share
there's a_good_variety_of breads available spinach
aloo
garlic etc
would_definitely_recommend_this_place
i_would_say this_is_a
than
dhaba calls itself an indian_bistro
and_it works for the_most_part
it serves a_choice_of salad or soup
dal
with every meal
they_have sort of a_modern feel
it works
dhabha in terms_of menu_items offers nothing_special compare_to maharaja
mahrani
taj and swagat
minerva does offer a_different menu
they_just do_it much better
also they_don't offer the_lunch_buffet but rather a lunch_menu which is_also_a welcome change
lunch_buffets just_don't have the_quality or freshness
plus you_cannot cater the spicyness
finally
a thing i_love is_their thali offerings on_weekends
meat or vegetarian
i_do wish_they would let_you mix and match the_thali with_the offered meat_and vege dishes
i_would_be willing to_pay a dollar more_for it
i_am_not_a vegetarian but enjoy vege food and_meat_dishes
p
my recommendations
their breads
i_don't_know why but theirs is far superior to_the competition true tandoori flavor
chicken chilli
lamb_samosa
spinach_and chickpeas
arrived_at
with my_wife mins before_they close for_the afternoon and_we_were refused service
perhaps the_food_is_good
i'll likely not try_again
my_wife_and_i went_for_lunch
the_food_was_very_good
traditional indian_fare
done well
food_was hot
service_was_attentive and unobtrusive
we'll go_again
unexpected delicious lunch_at a_place_i never_heard_of
i_had this incredible platter
thali
of fabulous vegetarian_dishes
every_dish was distinct and robust
the platter included rice
chana_masala
vegetable_korma and palak_paneer
all_was accompanied by_a flaky naan_and gajar halwah for_dessert
i_need_to bring my pakistani boyfriend aka significant other
partner
boy toy
or whatever you call your guy at age
the_next_time_i come
i_would_be interested in_his take
i_plan to_take_home significant leftovers so_he can_try them tomorrow
we_tried this for_lunch on_a_saturday
we_were_the first people to_arrive for_lunch a_little after am
the_server didn't mention_the specials
we_saw them on_the_way out
we_ordered appetizers that appeared_to be reheated a_bit
they_were_not hot or very_warm at_all
the_soup was_brought out while we_were_eating our appetizers
shortly afterward the_entrees_were brought out while_we_were still eating our appetizers
the lamb_masala had good_flavor for left_overs
the_same for_my wife's vegetable vindaloo
naan_is an_extra charge
soup is included
all in_all
clueless service_as far_as normal meal service goes
but polite
reheated food passed off as made_to_order
for_a_lunch i_would rather check out a_buffet for_less for_two_people
we_are always looking_for_a_good indian_restaurant
dhaba_is okay
but_i'm not_sure we'd make a_special trip to_go_there again
we began with samosas this_is maybe my_favorite appetizer
snack there_is
theirs
however
was_not up_to par at_all
first
they_came out way_too soon
which_means they_were made previously and reheated
we_were_there_for an_early dinner as_we did_not_have lunch
they_were on_the greasy side
but the_worst part_was the_taste
they_had no_spice whatsoever
i've_had samosas just_about in_every major city in the_country that_has a population of_people from southeast asia and_i expected some spice
they_were_so bland
it_was_like eating mash potatoes_in a pastry
and very_little texture as_well
i_do want to_say_that when_we sent the_back
they_were taken off_of our bill
the_rest_of_the meal fared better
my_husband_and_i shared an_order_of chicken_tikka_masala
which_was flavorful
we_also shared the_vegetable mix curry
which also was_good
the_nan was_a_tad on_the greasy side_and cooled off very quickly
becoming a cracker
i_think we're still looking_for that amazing indian_restaurant
this_indian food_is_great
consistent
and_delicious
jump in_and start eating
when dhaba opened in middleton
it became our weekly take_out option
i've never actually been to_the_restaurant as_my co_worker always makes_the pickup
over the_last six months we_have rated each_dish to_our preferences
here_is our list of_the_best tasting meals that we've_had
sadly
we have_not yet eaten our_way through the_whole menu
as long_as dhaba makes food
we'll continue eating our_way through the_menu
we've gone heavy on the_lamb_and vegetarian_dishes_and skipped most_of_the chicken_and beef
that_said
here_is our list_of favorite_dishes
all dishes_with an asterisk are my_personal favs
apps
lamb_samosa
mixed vegetarian platter
bread
onion_and pepper kulcha
garlic_naan
spinach naan

try dhaba and_enjoy them for_yourself
the girlfriend_and_i tried the_vegetarian dinner_for_two
i_don't_know_what was in_it
but_it_was great
the_waiter was_friendly_and didn't laugh at_us when_we_were confused on_what to_get
signed that guy
this_place_is so close_to_my office that_it_was inevitable to_try
so glad_i_did
the_best
most flavorful dishes are_served here
the_cheese_naan
although not_too traditional_indian
is the_best_i've_ever_had
their chicken_masala is_also incredible
the_price_is right for on_the go lunches with generous portions
a_bit overpriced for_dinner_with same menu portions as lunch
and_that's why they_get stars
another delicious meal
this_time with tariq by_my side
he really_enjoyed his_food but will_never stop measuring the_food against the incredible delights at anmol in milwaukee
that_said
dhaba did just fine
we_were_both over hungry after spending a_couple hours at shoe box
we_had_the allo tikki chat to_start
chana_masala and_a yummy potato mash together with_some sauce
for_entrees we_had lamb bhartha and paneer_masala
there_was loads_of tender lamb_in a_wonderful sauce
the_paneer are squares of homemade cheese in_a creamy masala_sauce
both_were perfectly seasoned to_the medium_spicy we_requested
we_also_had_the naan_that was_soft and_tasty
tariq had chai which_was excellent
not_too_sweet and_i_had_a mud puppy
dark beer
the_beer was_a_good compliment to_the spicy_food
the_service_was_excellent
i_would_have_liked a_little time to_finish my appetizer before the_entree arrived
final bill with_a full meal of leftovers to_go
discount for cash
we shall return
get_the to_the_dhaba
no excuse not_to
the_food_was_delicious and_well complemented by a_wonderful atmosphere_and service
the chi
nan
and biryani were to_die_for
the_food_was_great
unfortunately due_to_a chef error they_put mushrooms
which i'm allergic too
when we_requested none
they apologized and_gave the_meal for_free
but i'd_recommend being careful still
their_chai was_good
but_i_still miss the_taste_of jaggery
although there_are several good_indian restaurants_in_madison
there_are few to none where_i actually want_to sit down and_enjoy a_meal
so_i do take_out
dhaba_is the_exception with_its wide open windows and floor plan
and_overall pleasing ambience
plus the_food_was_excellent
the_veg samosa_was perfectly_cooked
and_even reheated beautifully in_the oven the_next evening
the crust is_the tough part with samosas
these_were flaky with_no toughness
the_lamb_vindaloo was certainly lively
but_not_too spicy
i_ordered_it medium hot and_it_came that_way sort of out_of on the_heat scale
the_lamb_was sufficiently tender which_is the_first_thing i look_for in_an_indian lamb_dish
i_thought_the sauce was_a_bit one dimensional
but_still satisfying
could use a_side_of raita
the baingan bharta was the_best_i've_had yet
it_had that beautiful mashed consistency with_plenty_of zing from the_garlic
ginger and eggplant
the_chicken spinach dish featured plenty of skinless chicken thigh
almost too_much in_that i_really_love that curried indian spinach sauce_with just_about anything
so the_chicken kind of dominated the_dish
i_ordered ginger naan_which_was sprinkled with cilantro and_was both tasty_and useful for sopping up_the delicious sauces
caution
yelp had this_place listed with a_full_bar
now corrected
which_was wrong
wine_and beer only
we_will_be_back when in_that part_of_town
the_ambience and table settings are comfortable
i_won't have_my sights set on_a beefeater martini now_that i_know
i_look_forward_to exploring more facets of dhaba's reliable cuisine
this weekend we ventured out to_an_indian_restaurant that_has received lots_of love from yelpers
though a_little_bit far_from where_we live
it_was_worth a_trip
coming at
the_restaurant only had_some customers inside
i_love_the ambience_and the decoration
pretty
neat and_clean
when_we_walked to_our_table
my_eyes are set to_the announcement on_the_wall that says
' if you_pay in cash
you'll have_a off for_lunch_and a_off for_dinner
fair enough
once we_were_seated
the_waiter came right away and_brought the_menu
four_of us chose one different dish so_we_could try four different meals
we_had quite a_variety_of meals
naan garlic
fish vandaloo
chicken_curry
shrimp_curry
lamb_biryani as_the main_courses
samosa_and lentil_soup for_appetizers
for the_drinks
we_had mango_lassie and chai
was_a_good_experience
the_price_is reasonable too
we'll be_back
food
we_ordered_the lamb_vindaloo_and paneer_masala
the_waiter asked_us on_a_scale from how_spicy we_wanted it
we_both said
the paneer_masala had a_little_bit_of heat but the_lamb_vindaloo was_not spicy_at_all
i_thought vindaloo_was inherently spicy
service
was poor
it_was pm on_a_friday_night
there_were_a_few parties waiting to_be_seated
but the_host did_not bother keeping track of who_was there first
after being_seated
we_waited_for minutes_before someone came to_our_table to_get us water_and take our_orders
the_food_took about_minutes to an_hour to_arrive
the_waiter did_not come_by at_all after taking our_order or dropping off our_food
finally
it_was_just as difficult finding someone_to bring_us our_check
we get_it
you're super popular and busy on_a_friday
work on_your customer_service
either hire more staff so each table can_get the attention it deserves or train your staff better
dhaba_is out_of_the way for_me_and i_probably will_not return
there_are other_restaurants with better service that_are closer_to me
this walking distance from hotel hilton garden which_was_nice
i_wanted_to_try out authentic_indian_food
this_place_was good
atmosphere quiet
nice_and ok to_eat by yourself
service was_also_good
now the_food too_many choices but i_ended_up getting chicken marsala with bread_with mixed ginger and_yogurt
very_good just wanted it_to_be more_spicy
my_boyfriend introduced me_to dhaba indian_bistro a_few_months back and_i_have_been a_fan ever_since
i_have_yet_to have a_bad_experience with either the_food or service
the staff_is_very_friendly and_definitely remember regular customers
i_really_enjoy the_basmati_rice
one_thing that i_do like about dhaba over my_favorite lunch spot curry_in the box is_that_they do_not use jasmine rice
while_i do like jasmine rice
the_basmati_rice is a_better fit for the_curry
long grain rice blends very well_with_the thickness of the_curry
they_offer_a large variety_of curries ranges from types_of curry's and spice_levels
the work on_a_scale of spiciness
with being_the hottest
let me just_say that_i_have gotten a yellow shrimp_curry dish on_a_scale and_it_was spicy so be_warned
a_scale_of is_your safest bet
my_boyfriend who loves spicy_food can barely withstand a
they_offer quite_a_bit of_curries
shrimp
chicken
beef
lamb
goat
etc
i_must admit that i_am_not the_biggest fan of_their cheese roti bread
i_definitely prefer curry_in the box roti bread over dhaba
however
dhaba's bread_is more thicker making_it easy to_dip the_bread into the_curry and_eat
their_prices do go up during_dinner
even though i've_only gone during their_lunch hours
i_was_told by a_regular that_their serving sizes aren't any different_from lunch to_dinner so keep that in_mind
it's_a_nice outing for_people who really_enjoy indian_food_and or curry
i_know for some_people
the_smell_of curry really turns them away from eating_at places_like such but the_restaurant does a great_job with
hiding
the smells
curry can_be very overwhelming but_the aroma when_you dine ad dhaba_is very inviting
i_would give_them_a
stars
my_boyfriend_and_i absolutely_love this_restaurant
the_service_is quick_and the_wait_staff is_very_friendly_and professional
try the_garlic nann it_has cilantro
i usually_get the_chicken_tikka_masala
you_can_order the_food from mild to spicy on_a_scale of
this_was_the_first place i_ever_had indian_food
i greatly enjoyed the_chicken_tikka_masala
i_went_back quite a_few_times because_i worked across_the_street
i've since had other_indian_places and_i_can say_this_is the_best_i've_had yet
the_cheese_naan was on_point
the_service_was superb
very_friendly always
they_even let us_know that_they_have
off_the charts
spicy
the hottest they_have would rate maybe_a on_the thai spice_level
so_if_you request off_the charts they_give_you some extra spice to_add on your_own
small little_place that_was very_clean_and modern
ordered the_lamb_vindaloo extra_spicy and_it_wasn't very_spicy
service_was_a_little slow_and they_only gave us one serving_of rice_for two_dishes
had_to_ask_for another
but it_took_a while to_get_the attention of our_server
food_was_good
but not_spicy like requested and like_it says on_the_menu
tried_this restaurant_on a wednesday night
we_didn't encounter any_of_the issues the_other_reviewers had
service_was fine
our_waitress_was attentive
friendly and_prompt
there were_only a_few_other diners present
many_indian
so_that's a_good_sign
decor is_ok
felt a_little 's to_me
but the_restaurant_is spacious and_the backs of_the booths are high enough_that you_can't see over them
a_plus
bollywood music_videos show on a_couple_of tvs
food_was_a couple dollars more_than we're used_to spending
but i_had_the_chicken_tikka
dry
off_the appetizer menu which_was entree sized and_my_friend had_a cauliflower curry
gobi
the vegetable_samosas were_good_and they offered_us a_variety_of chutneys
which_were more_like sauces than_a traditional
chunky
chutney tomato
mint and_coconut
all_good
garlic_naan_was good
too
biggest complaint_is the use_of plastic dishes
and why there_are chinese_food options on_the_menu_is beyond me
stick_to one cuisine
we_both agreed the_food we_had was_good_and we'd consider returning here
this_place isn't bad
i've never dined in
only ordered_take_out
the_staff_is nice
and the_interior_is pretty attractive with beautiful flooring and_a soothing atmosphere
minus the_tv
their_garlic_naan is_usually excellent
but the_other_dishes i've tried
baingan bartha and chole palak
are generally a_bit too_salty for my_tastes
i've_eaten here a_handful_of times
and_the saltiness is consistent
i_might stop_here again sometime
but_i'll be checking_out the_other nearby indian_options first
delicious chicken_tikka_masala
nice_decor
lots_of vegetarian_options
spicy
if you request it
went_there for_the_first_time with_my boss and a_group_of coworkers from_india
we_had_the lunch_buffet_and the_food_was_very_good
sadly they_didn't_have golab jamun
the fluffy cheese balls soaked in syrup
neither i_saw the_free_chai most indian_buffets have
i_like both because in other_indian_buffets i sweeten my
free
chai with golab jamun syrup
well
fulla a
's review says this_is food from_the chennai area
maybe chai_and jamun golab are_not from there
ok
back_to_the food
they_had interesting_and varied options
all of_them very_tasty
and_also had_good options_for vegetarian_dishes
paneer dishes_and vegetarian biryani
i_don't_remember the_names but_i tried almost_everything and_it_was_very_good
they_had like different chicken_dishes
soups
salad
and various other_items
and they_bring potato dosai to_your_table
the hubby_and_i went there_for_dinner last_night
they_only seem_to_have the buffet_for_lunch
so_we_ordered from_the regular_menu
we_shared chicken_tikka_masala
it_comes_with white_rice
and_garlic_naan
everything was_very_good
the_chicken_tikka_was delicious
the_sauce_was the tastier and creamier we have_ever_had
i_noticed it_had like pieces_of green herbs
usually the_tikka sauce in other_places is_just orange like color
this_one had dark small pieces
service_was_good as_well
our hostess and server were young girls and_they_were very_polite_and stopped by several_times
we_will_be_back even_though_it is_quite a drive
weekday_lunch buffet
stopped_in here today to_try_the_buffet
joined by arlin b
norm r
mike c
this_place_is really nice_inside
especially the_bathroom
no
really
i_started off_with
appetizer
it_was_a stuffed orange thing
sorry
i_don't_know_what was on_the_outside or inside of_it
but it_was_good
then it_was on_to the_two soups
one_of which_was very_spicy
whoops
i failed to_write down the_names_of them too
large plates were provided
to_me that speaks of
help yourself to all_the_food you_like
i_appreciated them
the_chicken_curry tandoori_chicken were_good
especially_the pulav
fancy rice
there_was_also chow citolo kootu
a_tasty lentils dish
aloo mutter
potatoes etc
more
about food_items in_all
after a_bit we_were each treated to a_dosa by our_server lady
the_food tends toward the_spicy here
so_i wouldn't recommend_it for_most kids
there_were also some negatives for_me
the_naan_bread_was plain sitting_out cold in_a serving tray rather than being brought piping_hot to_the_table
there_was no option_of garlic flavored
my_favorite
the soups other bowl friendly dishes had to_go into little stainless steel cups
yes
i've seen them at_some other_indian_buffets
but i_don't_like them
i_like medium sized china bowls because_they_are emotionally warmer and not_so warm
hot
for_your fingers trying_to carry them to_the_table
there_were_no
treats
to_speak of
beyond the_dosas and a_dessert that looked_like cream of wheat
wasn't
it_tasted ok
but_there_was no mango juice
no indian tea_and no gulab_jamun
monkey balls
numerous empty trays occupied serving area
perhaps they_are used for_the
buffet on_weekends
but_they yell
stingy
to_the weekday diner
the_opposite of_what the_big plates were trying_to say
soooo
all in_all
it's stars from_here for this_one
while it's_not
bad
really
i_think india_palace just_a block away is a_better choice
weekday_lunch buffet
i_guess it_was_a_good thing that_it_was rather cold_and rainy when_i came_here_for a_little buffet_lunch uye with rand h
mike c and arlin b
i_enjoyed_the food_but be aware that heat_level of_the_most of_the_food_was medium to medium hot which_i like
but might be_a_bit daunting for some_people
i_particularly enjoyed the_chicken_curry
the egg masala_and_the lentil dish
and_found the_other_dishes to_be quite_good
the_server was_very_attentive
and_the crispy dosas she_brought to_our_table was_a_nice addition_to our_meal
at_about bucks
the_price_of the_lunch_buffet_is about the_same_as most other_indian_buffets in_the_city
but_the spacious
sparkly clean setting brings this_place_a tad above the_rest for_me
they_really have_good south_indian_dishes especially kotthu paratto
spciy chicken garvy
but_i_would rate the_buffet as average in_terms if taste_and variety
and i_love_their biryani
staffs are really_nice
chennai chettinaad palace is_my_new favorite_indian_restaurant
the_lunch_buffet_is changed up every_day
they always_have so_many delicious dishes to_choose_from
be_sure_to have the_dosa
the_food_here_is just like_the_food i_had when_i_was in south_india
great_place_to try things you_have never_tried before
my gratitude to sarabear b
the hopi have blue corn piki
the southwest giant flour tortillas
chenai chettinad palace_has masala_dosai
for_me
that giant roll of ultra thin giant masala crepe piki tortilla with_a dab of_potato dosai was worth_the visit
this_is_a pleasant
visually inviting place
the booth for_our business conversation tall
quiet and_comfortable
as_others mention
service_was_attentive
the food_was_decent
i_cannot name all_the_dishes in_the weekday_lunch buffet
we_all ate veggie
finished the_meal with_the dosai
and were_quite satisfied
went_for_lunch on_a monday with_very low expectations but_was wowed by_the ambience_and good_food
fantastic
tried this_restaurant times_for buffet
luckily all times food_was too good
specially spicy chicken_tandoori and_dry black paper chicken
just make_sure_you go_there before pm for_lunch_buffet else most_of_the item would_have already finished
they_have improved a_lot compared_to opening week month
the_dosas are_good compared_to_other_indian restaurants near by
now they_have kothu paratha
service_is_good and improving a_lot
we_went_here last_night for_the_first_time and_had_a fantastic dinner
my_husband_ordered a_spicy vegetable soup and_we_got two_orders_of chicken_tikka_masala
he_didn't like his soup and_said it_tasted_like spicy water with_some spices
so_we will_try something different next_time
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was awesome
but the_rice it_came_with was_pretty bland
although_i felt it_was fine when paired with the_masala
the_garlic butter naan we_ordered_was seriously amazing
and dipping it_in the_tikka_masala sauce was_the_best part_of_the_meal
our_server_was very_sweet and_very efficient
however they_were definitely understaffed for_the_amount_of people dining
i_think she may_have been serving most_of_the tables in_the_place
so it_took_a little longer to_get everything than_it probably should_have but_it_was never so_long that_it_was ridiculous
the_restaurant_itself_is beautiful
very_clean_and well designed
you_would never be_able_to know such_a nice_place is hidden_in the shopping mall
there_was plenty of open parking and it_seemed_like the_place didn't_get busy until
ish
definitely_a later crowd
our price_for the_soup
two dinners
naan_and tip was
which_was very_reasonable
we_will absolutely be_back soon
went_for buffet long lines
food_very greasy
not_good
frequently ran out_of food
no_more visits here
went_to sunday lunch_buffet
buffet opened at noon
usd per_person
the_chicken_tikka_masala_and paneer butter masala_were flavorful
the_potato was_nice too
the_naan_was perfectly textured
their atmosphere_is classy
service_is pleasant
the_water does not taste_like tap water_and is_actually tastes_like soft mineral water
not iced
i_think my boo and_i were_the_only non indian_pakistani there lol
clean
fresh
usd for weekend lunch_buffet
i_would def go_again
i_think_i found myself a_new fav place
this_place_is ok ok
the_food_is but the_service_is pathetic
i_have_been_here times_and everytime the_service_is equally bad
if the_owner_is listening via yelp
please you_have a_good_thing going_on but the_service_is ruining your restaurant
please please improve on_the service factor
try chinese_food here
very_good
had_the_lunch_buffet
best_indian i've_had on the_west_side by far
i've_had other_indian_restaurants
and none_of them have_come close_to being this good
first positive sign
everyone_in the_place_was indian
second positive sign
all_the_food was_spicy
had_to_ask_for a masala_dosa for my_daughter so that_she could_eat
delicious
will_be_back soon
there_was_a tv that_was too loud
i_really hate having tv on at places
let alone with volume on
someone asked they turn it_down
and_they i_think didn't understand the english well enough_to comply
could_be an_issue going forward
i_took_my spouse out_for indian_food_this evening
rather than our usual we_wanted_to try_a_new location_and chennai chettinaad did_not_disappoint
we_tried a_variety meat_and vegetarian_dishes
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was flavorful_and mildly spicy
my_go_to
heat
dish
lamb_vindaloo
was_flavorful with tender chunks_of lamb
while_i had_ordered the maximum spice_level what_i received was_a medium
we also_ordered_a vegetarian dosa_which was done_with the_same level_of care as the_other_dishes
the_last dish ordered_was biryani
the_biryani was a_solid good
i_look_forward_to seeing what_it_is like with added
heat
the_service at_the_restaurant was_good to very_good
all in_all a_very charming restaurant whose attention_to detail showed in everything from_the excellence of_the_dishes to the_decor
a_lot nicer than we_thought it_would_be since the_location was_a kyoto bowl before
the_food_was_great
it_was_a_little too quiet
they_didn't_have any music_playing
service_was nice_and_the food_was_tasty and decently priced
this_place_is somewhere that i_will_not return
after seeing reviews_here
i_thought_that going to_this_restaurant for_the_lunch_buffet was_a_good idea
however
a_good portion_of the_food_was_not palatable
dishes_that were_okay
the_rice
chicken_biryani
cold but flavorful
chicken_tikka_masala
some_of this chicken was_very overcooked
but_at least palatable
naan
gulab jabun
like_a donut hole delicious
dishes_that were_not decent
appetizer
some donut looking thing
paneer mutter masala
this_is usually one_of_my_favorite dishes
but_was disgusting
fish
i_don't_know why i_tried fish at a_buffet
but not_impressed
curry_chicken
i_thought just the_service would_be bad
and_it_was
i_was_expecting that
did_not get_a refill
this_was somewhat expected with_the comments on_here that i_read before choosing this_restaurant
i_can totally accept poor_service if_the_food tastes good
overall
i_paid
for_this meal
and_did_not even eat a_full plate because unfortunately on_the two plates i_did have
not everything_was worthy of_being put into_my body as it_would taste so bad going down
i_have_been eating_indian_food for_over years
i_love_it and_this_was such_a sad food_experience
after spending the_past summer in berkeley and thoroughly enjoying all_of_the fabulous indian_restaurants there
it_is_so disappointing that_it so extremely difficult to_find_a decent indian_restaurant_in_the north valley
the_last_time_i enjoyed indian_food_in phoenix_area was_when i_went_to tempe but_that_is too_long of_a journey from_where i_live now
the struggle to_find decent indian_food_in_the north valley continues
but_i know_that i_will_definitely not be_going back_to_this_place
stunningly good_and authentic_indian_food
just the_right spices
well prepared and_reasonably_priced
while_visiting scottsdale we realized we_needed to get_away from there asap
discovered_this_place when traveling west
awesome joint
i thoroughly_enjoyed their gobi chettinaad masala aloo mutter
their mango_lassi_was yummy
wish i_was_able_to eat more but i_was_so full
the_waiter who i_believe was the_owner_was super_friendly
this_place_has decent decor for_a valley indian_restaurant_and very average_food
the_dosas at ananda bhavan or_even karaikudi are way_better
the_service_is quite inadequate and_even rude at_times
quite frustrating
had a_very_nice dinner here_last_night
with great_service_and lots_of delicious_food
we_had a_couple_of dosai
a_veggie curry and_lamb_vindaloo which_was_delicious
good_prices
it_was_very quiet there_so i_hope_they survive as they_are_very close and we_will_be_back
in_short
tasty
spicy south_indian_food
but the_quality lacks consistency
nice_ambiance
service_was bad before
but it_has improved a_lot now
details
lunch_buffets
been_a patron at_this_restaurant during_my year's stay_in glendale
lunch_buffets on weekdays has_a small_but nice menu
i wold recommend their biryani
lunch_buffets on_weekends has lot many_options
but vegetarians may_not find the_taste so exciting
i_would_recommend their fish on weekend buffets
dinner
a_la_carte
all curries_are prepared_with southern spice_levels
which_means you_will sweat if_you_order moderate or high spice_levels
uttappam and dosas_are well prepared_and are_served with_good cutneys
mini idli's do_not come soaked in sambar
biryani
s
are tasty_but not_as_good_as bawarchi
near scottsdale
my_favorite of_all is
schezwan fried_rice
with 'chicken '
i_would_recommend it for_all those who crave ultra spicy_food
cons
many_times
the_same dish did_not taste the_same when ordered on different days
which_means i_cannot have_a favorite
the_service at the_beginning of was too_bad
i_agree_with some_other yelpers
at_times they_even forgot some_of_my orders
but they_have improved towards the_end_of
by_and far the_most_authentic and_tasty indian_food i_have_tasted so_far in_the_us
i_had come all_the_way from albuquerque to_try_their food_and every_dish we_ordered_was very_well prepared that i_felt that_i_was back in_india
even though there_are_some delays in service_at peak hours
it_is obvious largely owing to_their awesome_food
i_will come_back_again to phoenix just to_try the_food_here
hats off to_the team there
outstanding lunch_buffet
i_am_giving this_restaurant stars based_on_the lunch_buffet_and cleanliness
i_come_here often
about times a_month
with family or friends_for the_amazing selection at their_lunch_buffet
friday through sunday is_my_favorite time to_come because_the_food is_much spicier
beware
this_place_is packed on those days
if you prefer it_on_the mild side then stick_with the monday thursday buffet_or come during_dinner hours when you_can_order it however you prefer
i_have noticed_that the people_in my_party are_usually the_only non_indian people dining here
which_is an_excellent sign_that the_food_is authentic
i've never been_to_india
so unfortunately i_cannot say for certain
this_restaurant_is always very_clean
the service_can_be hit_or_miss
sometimes we_get fantastic_service and_other times not_so_much
but_that may be due_to_a communication barrier that_the_food more_than makes_up_for
tips
great_place_for vegetarians who like it_spicy
yes
they_do also serve meat
be_sure and_try rasam sambar soups
they are_both delicious
due_to_the service
i_will_never go_back
i_love_indian_food_and have_been_to quite_a few_places in_the_valley
chennai's food was_average
when we_actually received what we_ordered
dinner service
pros
relatively fast turn around following ordering
food_was_pretty_good
if nothing_to_write_home about
cons
servers had_no_idea what_was on_the_menu
they came_back twice to ask_if
that 'chinna' thing
was_a soup and_then seemed_to point at_the_menu at random
asking
is_that_it
channa_masala
it's_a pretty ubiquitous dish
and_i_can show it_to you on_the_menu if you hand it to_me
of_the dishes_we_ordered
came accurately
were entirely inaccurate
e
g
chaat when we'd ordered_a curry_dish
and_never showed up at_all
they tried_to charge us_for dishes we_didn't order in_addition_to those we_did
we had_to_ask the_waitress for_water x before she_brought it
if you're_going_to go_there
go for_the_lunch_buffet
the_less you_have_to interact with the_servers
the_better
ok
the_reviews were rather depressing and_we decided_on indian buffet_for_lunch
we decided_on chennai chettinaad palace and_was_not disappointed_in the_least
atmosphere_was charming
unlike it predecessor tokyo express
service_was wonderful and_the_food very_flavorful_and exciting
my_only agreement with_other reviewers is_that most_of_the_dishes
of_which there_is_a great_selection
would_be that_it_is just a_touch beyond
comfortable spicy
when_we_left
our_table was_the_only empty table there
it_was packed_with folks waiting both inside_and out
we_were_the_only non_indian patrons
i would_love_to review all_the different foods
like chili fish_and chicken
goat and_more
please accept my apology as_i hardly know what they_were or their ingredients
but_the_food_is wonderful
try_it
its worth_it
dined here_last_night
the_food_was_very_good indeed
lamb kurma
chicken_saag
and_a_few other_dishes
well presented and_quite flavorful without being overwhelming
five_stars
the_servers_were not up_to that standard
sadly
they_were certainly inexpert and_seemed inexperienced
i'll be_back though
the annoyance of bumbling service_was far outweighed by the_quality_of_the delicious_food
my_favorite_indian_place in_the_valley
i've_had them_all
and it_isn't close
spicy
and_delicious
the_lunch_buffet on_the saturday was_simply superb
i_went_with low expectations because i_am_from nova
dc metro where there_are tons_of indian_restaurants but chennai chettinad really surprised me
food_was_pretty authentic_and had tons_of veg options
dosa was_missing in_the_buffet but desserts was a_surprise
fish_curry
palak_paneer
goat_curry chicken biryaani were the_best
everything was_tasty_and would_definitely come_back_here if_i visit phoenix
keep_it up guys
tasty
spicy_food
we love_this_place for_its indo_chinese and south_indian_dishes
rest_of_the stuff is_very inconsistent but is_good most_of_the times
the_service_was extremely bad when_it_comes_to the_waiters
it_has improved a_bit now
but_i_would at least expect my_server to_say a 'hi'
which youll never get_here
most_of_the servers_are rude_and they_will find_a way_to mess up your_order each time
food arrives very slowly on busy days
less for these things n i_really feel the_management should do something_about em
i_don't_know_what to_say
i love_the_food but_as everyone says the_service_is terrible
part_of_the reason is_that_the owners steal all_of_the tips from_the waitresses
they_make minimum wage
and_all_the tips go_to_the owners
i_am torn
it_is without question my_favorite food
but the_owners steal from the_servers
so i_don't_think_i should eat_here
really disappointing
what does one do in_this case
the_other_indian_restaurants around here_are terrible
so_i_can drive to tempe to support better practices for servers
or i_can eat_here and support thieves with delicious_food
awesome indian_lunch_buffet
if quality_of_food is important to_you
you_will love_this_place
even
for a_change
i_liked_the dessert options
the_family and i_went_to_this today after seeing_the advertisements
my fiance was_really_excited to_go
so_i agreed hoping this_would_be_a nice break from_the norm and a_great_way_to spend an_early saturday evening
we_arrived right at pm
bought our tickets
adults
kids no kids discount
and entered the festival
we_were immediately grabbed by_a hard sell timeshare company and_it_took more effort than_i planned on spending to break away
the festival was relatively empty
granted it_was early in_the day
and there_were_a_few open booths
one major disappointment is we_found no japanese food
which i_was_hoping for
vietnamese
filipino
and thai were_all well represented
as_well_as_a couple hawaiian fusions
but_that_is about_it
the_food trucks were definitely_a highlight
we_both chose truck norris and_it kicked ass
see separate review
as the_day progressed
the_crowd only mildly picked up but_the entertainment slightly elevated
all told
we_left at_about
pm after_a roughly expenditure
i_believe the event is priced on_the high side
but_was enjoyable
this_is_the second annual
hopefully they_will gain momentum in_years to_come
we_will_definitely give_them_a shot next year as_well
note
bring cash
atm fee is
and_no_one takes credit
did someone say food festival
asian cuisine
las_vegas asian food festival here i_come
access and parking at silverton casino was easy and we_had_no problem
entrance thru casino
valet was helpful and_gave precise directions
follow signs
pass aquarium
pass gift shop and hang a right
entry pool area where_you are greeted by event staff who will direct you where to_go
i_picked up tix at will call thru vip entrance since_i won tix through_a drawing via yelp
thank_you thank_you
arrived late afternoon
sun wasn't beating down
so_the festival was shaded for the_most_part
i_was_expecting it_to_be crowded and_have long lines but_i'm guessing it_was their down time and_it_wasn't that busy nor did_i have_to_wait in hour long lines thankfully
scoped and_did walk thru to figure out_what to_eat
the layout was nicely organized and made_it easy_to figure where everything_was
food trucks towards carnival side l
a
and_our local vegas ones represented the gourmet food trucks
food vendors towards freeway side filipino
hawaiian
thai
chinese
korean
vietnamese
and_indian cuisines represented
oh_and italian ice and shave ice
well more_like snow cone textured ice to_me
see pix
honestly i'm_really not_a_fan_of food served up_from warming trays that look_like they have_been sitting_out
not_sure how long it's_been sitting_out so_i'm more likely to skip out cause that's_what they_had
mid section had retail vendors
a caged fighting area
and_the dj blasting music
carnival rides and mickey d's towards back area
dining areas there were_three of_them
the tented vip one
you_need your vip pass to gain access to here
banquet tables_with apps were being_served when_we_were there around ish
the sake and bar started later on
lucky i_read via website the info so_i timed arriving here perfectly
the_area towards_the back had high top tables where you_can stand
it_wasn't shaded but at_the_time we_went the sun was low enough_that it shaded the_area
the_other dining_area was tented with tables_and chairs
plenty of seating
being_the clean freak that_i_am
i_appreciate that the_dining_area was_pretty clean for_an outdoor event
they_had festival staff who bussed and_clean the areas continually the_time_we spent there
the garbage cans were emptied also
just little things_like this made_it more aesthetically pleasing
the_variety_of entertainment lineup during_the time_we_were_there varied
hot hula fitness just finished up when_we_arrived
when we_sat_down to_eat_there was thai acrobatics followed by_a tai chi demo
then ronald mcdonald telling corny jokes and performing magic tricks
the_kids both young and young at heart seemed_to enjoy_the show and_that's all_that mattered
i_ended hitting up_the truck norris
fluff ice and sin city cupcakes
i_have an obsession with food trucks what can i_say
love_the unique_and different twists of hawaiian filipino food and_desserts from truck norris and fluff ice who are_both from_the los angeles area
and sin city cupcakes
alcohol infused cupcakes
need i_say more
i'll follow up_with separate yelp_reviews for_them
ive learned from attending past foodie festivals to_take cash since some_of_the vendors and_food trucks do_not take debit credit cards
so bring cash with you
the admission price initially might scare people away but note it's_good for_both days with in out privileges
kids get_in free if_they_are a certain height
so tell the taller kids to bend at_the knees a lil bit so you're under_the
limit
haha
you_can pick up a_coupon off at_a mcdonald's
one_of_the sponsors for_this event plus part_of_the proceeds go_to_a good cause
our local ronald mcdonald house
i_found all_this info on the_website before_i came
so it_is_a good_value if you take advantage_of attending the_weekend
we_enjoyed our afternoon and will_be_back
i_am a_big_fan_of festivals
and_also happened_to be lucky enough_to win a pair of vip tickets via yelp
thanks again misti
so_i_decided_to check_out_the asian food festival
upon approaching the silverton
i_saw tons_of rides and booths set_up and_i_was ready_to have fun and_eat a_lot
upon walking_into the festival
i_was_in food para para paradise
i_saw many familiar food vendors
as_well as_some new ones and_i_was eager_to eat a_lot
for my_main meal
i_decided_to_try some filipino food since_i've been craving_it for_a_while now
the_food_was tasty_and reminded me_of my best friend's food_from back_home in california
having_the vip tickets was_also_a huge bonus to_the fair
who could say no to comp drinks
i_am definitely looking_forward_to next year_and the reunion i'll_have with_all_the delicious_food
i_do love_this_place but_i'm only going_for stars as this_review_is based on takeaway
not the_full restaurant experience
it_has_been opened now for_about a_year and replaced oscars on slateford road
there_is_a restaurant_which seems_to do pretty_good business
i popped in before on_a_friday for a_takeaway and_it_was_pretty full which_is always a_good_sign
with_lots_of other popping in_to collect takeaway too
their takeaways are awesome
first_visit at new years was_for meal deal_for and_we added extra bits
pakora
naan
extra rice
on to_make_it a meal_for seriously
there_was tons_of food
even feeding three with pub munchies
meant there_was still another_meal and_a_bit left for_another day
meat_is cooked amazingly we_had_a chicken_korma and_there_was a_lamb_dish with_mint whose name escapes me
i_would_never order lamb normally and_didn't intend on even trying_it but it_was_awesome
totally melt in_the mouth gorgeousness
i_tried_to look_for it last_night but probably missed it on_the_menu due_to tiredness and starvation so i_opted_for a_chicken dupiaza
it_was lovely
subtly spiced tomatoey sauce_with huge chunks_of tender_chicken and slices of red and_green peppers_and onions yum
i_ordered boiled rice to_go_with it and_when_i opened the bag at_home
not_only did_i have my_order
but_a_little tubs containing a chopped onion salad_and some mango_chutney
i_think this_is_a jashans thing as_there is_always some_kind_of salad_and sauce thing_that comes extra which_is a_nice_touch
so
yep
jashans is_worth checking_out
there_are deals on for_the restaurant_on sundays
and lunchtimes during_the week
if you fancy a bargain lunch treat
the_staff_are lovely_and the_restaurant_is really nicely_decorated
very modern
but with_lots_of red
orange and gold accents to reflect the_indian and bangladeshi theme
i_was_really happy_to_see a curry_house open on slateford road
in part it always struck me_as odd that there_are
now_i think
chinese style takeaways or restaurants yet no indian
however jashans is_a mixed bag
i_can't fault the_quality_of_the meat and_the milder curries_are decent however_the spicier dishes lack any differentiation outside_of an_extra chopped chili or some chunks_of garlic
they_all use the_same base sauce giving no depth to_the flavour
perhaps_the demand simply isn't there_for_the spicier dishes_and thus when one_is ordered it_is_an exception
however this doesn't excuse that it_feels_like there_is_a lack_of care in these_dishes
jashans is ideal for_those that enjoy milder curries
but_if_you_are looking for_something a_little hotter
madras or similar
there_are definitely better_places
it_was sunday_night
it_was late
it_was cold
it_had_been snowing on_and off all weekend
neither me or my_boyfriend could face cooking dinner so_we_decided_to finally try jashans which_had opened up down_the_street from his flat a_number_of months_ago
we phoned our_order in_and headed over_to pick_it up
i_was_a_bit shocked entering the_restaurant_itself
as it_really rather quite posh looking
all rich sumptious colours and dark wooden tables
i_was definitely impressed
perhaps less so_when we_had at least three different waiters come up_to us to_ask what our take away order_was
um we already ordered and_we_are just waiting for_the_food now
it_also took_about three attempts to_pay
about_minutes after_our arrival though
we_had paid and_the_food_was brought to_us and_we hopped in_the car to head home
i unpacked the_items which_included poppadums
onion salad
garlic chicken
green herb chicken
saag aloo
pilau_rice
and_a peshwari_naan
i_did like that_the_food came_in tupperwares which meant for_less chance of_an accidental spillage while carrying it_from car to flat
but_i_found that the_food_was barely on_the hot side
more warm moving_to room temperature
to_be fair the_curries_were perfectly nice_and i_really_enjoyed_the naan
it_was lovely_and coconuty and_sweet but without that weird hideous orange dyed coconut colour that_you usually_get
but_i_felt like_this_place fell short of_the_other amazing curry_houses that edinburgh has_to_offer as i_can really only describe my_meal as nice_and not_overly memorable
it_was_also a_bit_more expensive than i_would_have expected for a_takeaway
so sadly
it's only_a ok_and i_may encourage my_boyfriend to order_from a_different establishment the_next_time we opt for_an_indian to_take away
awesome banquet meal
each every sunday
had_never hard of_this_place until a_few ago and_now i'm a_regular
lovely naan_bread
nice starters and fragrant currys they_have
a_tapas indian_style
great evening out_and a_great_meal
so_i_have ventured back into jashans twice this year_and all_i_can add_to my original review is_that_the hotter curries have improved enough_to warrant another_star
i_have_had a vindaloo and_a madras and_there_were subtle differences in_the flavour and_just the_right difference in heat
tasty
thing_is while_i am happy to_say the_restaurant_has improved
this could_be bad_for my waistline as i_live just round the_corner
oh_well
it is_always_good to_have another option_for curry
discovered_this delightful place last_night a_choice_of main_dishes designed to_be shared by two we_had_a chickpea and_sweet potato curry platter which_was_delicious and fun to_share
we_sat on_the cute little balcony which_has coloured voiles on the_windows but had_a peek inside downstairs they play an_old classic movie as folks dine and_there_is_a chilled bar area with low seating
colourful decor_and a cosy atmosphere
the_food_is franco indian and_there_is only_one vegetarian choice
the_desserts are good_too
knickerbocker glory style but with_a difference
my_partner had_a mango explosion and i_chose a banana and toffee combo
the also make_a mean mojito
it_is reasonably_priced_and the_staff_are friendly
cozy and trendy
a global experience
sensory escape
le passepartout was_simply amazing
we_walked_in to a_little oasis that_is tucked_away off_the royal mile on old fishmarket close
and_we_were welcomed to_this fantastic new_restaurant
the_main dining_area is cosy and_has beautiful
bright coloured pink walls_and simple tables_with lovely pillows and decorations
it_feels_like like you_are stepping into a_lovely moroccan restaurant or_a southeast asian restaurant it_is_a mix_of both and a_fantastic fusion of cultures
and_of_course foods
the_menu_is short but overwhelming in deciding what to_choose because_there are_so_many fantastic choices
you_can either have_many starters as tapas or a_main that_is_a sharing platter for_two
there_are_no mains for_one
for for_one you_could go tapas_style or have_a very big dinner
for_an odd number_of people like when we_had three tonight
it_was_perfect sharing a_variety_of tapas starters and_one main sharing platter
for_the starters
or
there_is_a fantastic pulled pork
an_excellent moroccan chicken
chili_chicken strips
marinated minted lamb
only
jalape o cream cheese fritters
deep_fried squid and chorizo and_spiced bean stew
we_had six and_they_were each amazing
they_are small_but at great_prices and_are absolutely_delicious
we_had_the perfectly exquisite whole scottish lobster with thai green chili_sauce and singapore style noodles and_vegetables
the_dish_was large_and plentiful
and_it_was to_die_for
for
it_was_one_of_the more expensive main
for_two remember
but_still a_great_deal for how_much there_was and_how fantastic it_was to_have_a whole lobster cooked so perfectly
my_only quibble with it_was_that it_was_quite messy and also_very hard_to manage the lobster that_was somewhat cracked into pieces but could_have done_with lobster cracker as_it_was difficult and_hard on_the hands to_get all_of_the tasty meat out
other mains included slow roasted lamb
for_the sharing platter for_two is a_great_deal
and_a scottish t bone steak
desserts were_good but_very cream oriented and few chocolate options
i_had_the chocolate mousse drenched in ice_cream and whipped cream
while the_others had_a liquid dessert of espresso coffee ice_cream with cognac and creme de cacao
the_environment here_is lovely_and relaxed with candle light tables low ceilings
there_is_a special alcove for_two to snuggle in while_they dine
and_a_great downstairs area for a_different but_also lovely atmosphere
and_it_is also_great for groups
i_love_this_place and will_definitely be_back
it_is_a fun place with_friends and_also perfect_for a romantic date
what_a strange evening
good_food
tiny
hot venue
disorganised but friendly_staff
we_arrived and were_offered a_table 'downstairs' ie in a_wee
dark
empty room with_a tv screen covering one wall
it's_the rolling stones
said our_waitress
we_said
em
can we see upstairs
which_was bright and_full_of people
very bright_and very full it's_a hot
pink
tiny cave
make your_own analogies
and we_had_to limbo dance into_our seats but
so_far so_good
we_ordered
and_sat chatting
and_sat
minutes later
the_waitress admitted they'd forgotten our_order
and were_just putting it_on now
man
so
we were_a_bit fed up by this_point
eventually
they_did bring some_food
and_it_was_delicious squid
lamb kofta
and_some chorizo and bean stew to_start
and while_we_were still eating those
our shared lobster main arrived
is_it so odd to want_a clean plate
when_my starter was_a runny
spicy stew
apparently
the lobster was_tasty
i_haven't_had a_whole lobster before
so_it_was quite_a challenge
but fun
and_we just_got stuck in_and messy
and enjoyed_it
then ate_the delicious noodles it_came_with
the_food really was_pretty_good
and in_the_end
they_took the_wine off our bill as_an apology for the_wait
so_we_had three starters
a lobster and_a bottle_of_wine for
which_is not to_be sneezed at
but too_hot and pink and bothersome for_me to_go_back
not_quite a_review
as i've not managed_to contact them_to book a_table
but_they_are at least now on twitter
https
twitter
com tuktukedinburgh
the web site isn't up_to much just yet
http
tuktukonline
com
i_am really looking_forward_to eating_there
hopefully soon
had to_give_it_a star_rating
so have_gone with_a moderate ' '
but note that_i've not tasted any food yet
so
i sort of feel bad to_review this_restaurant this early
as_others have mentioned how they've only opened recently and_are working out_the kinks
my_friend_and_i went_here_for dinner after work on_a_thursday about weeks after opening and_were very_excited to_come_here after seeing_the restaurant's tuk tuks wandering the streets
first of_all
it's_a_great location in_the heart of tollcross
across from king's theatre and conveniently next_to a co op when you_want_to take advantage_of tuk tuk's byob policy
the branding they've developed is_very smart and makes_it look_like it's part_of a chain
after asking one_of_the waitstaff who_is a school friend_of the_owner
he said_they hope_to eventually expand in this_way
the_interior_is very stylish but also_has an_old building charm
we_only discovered upon visiting the toilets that the_building must_have used_to_be_a bank
as there's a_huge vault door in_the ladies'
the_music was_also_very fun
who doesn't love a_bit_of bollywood
the major problem_with our_visit was the_wait for_the_food
we_were_seated_immediately when_we_arrived
but because there_was a_large_group that_had sat down not long before us
the_kitchen had_a hard time dealing with the_number_of orders
our_server continually apologised for_the delay and even_brought out complementary poppadoms when_we_asked for_something because_we_were starving after waiting_for such a_long_time
i_would think_that once they_have their_service down
they_would aim to_bring out_the tapas_style dishes as they're ready
but_we mostly got ours all at once as in_a normal restaurant
the_food_was_good
each_dish came_in a_perfect portion_size considering one_person is recommended to_order dishes
there_was this mysterious sauce_that seemed_to appear drizzled on most_of_the_dishes
my_friend didn't much care_for it but_it_wasn't listed on_the_menu so she_didn't know not to_ask_for it
the_dishes also came_in these small metal dishes_that
while stylish
were very_hot to_the touch
it made_it difficult if you wanted_to pour a_curry over rice_or to_pass a_dish over_the table_to someone
at the_end_of_the_meal
though
the_bill was_surprisingly affordable for_the_amount we_ordered
though at_that time they could_only take cash as payment
luckily
it's_located right_next_to the co op
i plan_on going back_here because i_think_they have_a_lot_of potential and room to_improve on_this_one experience
i'm excited to_see_this local business grow
hopefully for_the better
ok
never_heard_of it until taken by friends
looks pretty_good
friendly_staff
food though takes it_to_the next level
we_had quite a_few veggie_and meat_options
chicken lollipops
lamb_chops
railway lamb etc all went down well
tarka dal was_superb as_was_the paneer_and masala chips
food_came reasonably quickly in tapas_style dribs and drabs
of_us_had a feast and_it_came to_just over
obviously booze not included
i will_be_returning
really_enjoyed my visit_here
indian tapas mean you_can_order a_number_of dishes
two_of_us had dishes plus rice_and_naan which_was enough to_fill us up
cost with tip
of_the_dishes
were_fantastic
one pretty_good and_one very average
the_lamb was_a_bit tough and_the_sauce contained too_much ghee
overall though the_food_was_good_and just_that bit different to_your ordinary indian_restaurant fare
i'd_definitely go_back
ecclectic decor_and music makes for_a_good atmosphere
i_recommend booking at the_weekend as_it_was completely full on_the saturday we_visited
byob which you_can buy at_the co op just next door
tuk_tuk is_fresh
bright_and new
offering_a street_food spin on_indian_food
essentially
what they_have on_offer is tapas_style indian
so it's_not_a style with which you'll be entirely unfamiliar
it's early days for the_place
and_i_don't feel they've really found_a range_of dishes that_will wow customers
but they're starting from a_solid foundation
so have every chance_to develop into a_really_good wee place
overall
we_said
tuk_tuk is worth_a_visit
but i'd_be surprised if you're blown_away by what they_have on_offer
the_idea is a_good_one
but the_quality_and or originality needs to_be cranked up_a notch if the_place_is going_to put broad grins on_the faces of diners
for now
it's quietly pleasing
which_is quite a_good starting point
i_look_forward_to visiting
later in_the year
to_see_how the_menu_has evolved and_how they've developed their offering
sitting_on a prominent corner opposite the kings theatre
tuk_tuk indian street_food is_an odd mix_of modern minimalist marketing and traditional simple street_food
it works on_a tapas_style approach they recommend two people order between and dishes_and work from there
it's_not licensed so byob is the_order of_the_day
no corkage charge
so
last_night
when_i_was the lead guitarist out_of_the shadows
we_decided_to pop in here_after picking_up a_rather nice bottle_of red on_the_way
when_it_comes_to tapas
i_come over_all carol vorderman and select random dishes from different sections without much attention_to what's actually in them
sometimes it works and_sometimes my_food allergies get_the better of_me
on_this occasion i_think_it's safe to_say_it worked out reasonably well
we_had
fish cakes
not_that_great
yes they_were shaped like cakes and had_an 'aroma de la mer' but somehow the subtle flavours were lost amidst the_rest
they_would_have benefited from some_kind_of dipping sauce
they_weren't that hot either
lamb kebabs that_could have_done with_a yoghurt dressing but_otherwise were pretty_decent
chilli garlic chicken
fantastic
a lamb_curry
almost as_good_as_the chilli garlic chicken
hakka chilli paneer
just confusing
think singapore noodles meets rogan_josh
it_tasted ok_but somehow my senses were working overtime to comprehend what_i_was seeing and what_i_was tasting
on_the side we_had rice_and_garlic nan
both good
we_finished off with_a_couple_of chai teas
so in summary
i_think tuk_tuk is_probably a_decent 'try me' kind of_place
but_i_don't_think there's enough here_to keep_me coming_back_for more
yes the_bill is_quite reasonable
but you've already paid_for your booze and it's_easy_to leave that calculation off the_total
as with_most tapas ventures there will inevitably be a_couple_of dishes_that don't totally work so you_have_to focus on_the overall appeal of_the_meal
tuk_tuk is a_different sort of_indian
tapas_style and set out more_like_a modern diner than a_restaurant
there_is_a minimalist and bright style that works well_with_the street_food aim
the_food_is_good
we_had_a reasonable selection_of dishes
meaty and_vegetarian
and sides
massala chips
nan_and pickle selection
and_we_all left happy
and_full
and it_was_all fairly inexpensive
in_short modern setting
good_food_and byob
what_is not_to like
popped in here_last_night for_some impromptu food_after a_couple_of beers at benetts over the_road and we_were_not_disappointed
contemporary decor with_lots_of asian twists in_the theme caught my interest from_the outset
really_nice roomy space with_lots_of seating options from tables to massive benches
the_menu_is mainly tapas with options galore for veggies_and vegans too
so thumbs_up from_the better half
i_opted_for_the mixed_grill and dare i_say it this_was better_than_the kebab_mahal mixed_grill that_was my previous bench mark
i managed_to try_some_of the_paneer noodles
which_were really_tasty as were the_mixed pickle jars
these_are tiny little jars but packed full_of_flavour
all in_the of_us_had a_great_meal and will_be_back
d
ahh yes a_side note it_is byob so_if_you fancy some vino with_your pakora make_sure_to grab some before_you turn up
if_not there_is_a coop and_a supermarket close at hand
it's being your_own wine_and or beer with_no corkage
the_indian_food here is_great
and i_really_enjoy the_atmosphere
they_say that_every person should order dishes but_i_think that's cray cray
two is enough_for me
there's_a youthful atmosphere that i_like about_this_place
it's clean
airy
with fun bright orange colours
so very_different to_what i_normally experience_at other_indian_restaurants
all of_them i'm_not bothered to_sit_in
the food_tastes fresh
i_ordered_the railway station lamb and_it_came in it's own mini pot with_an abundance of_spinach in_the_sauce
i_thought_that was a_nice_change
generally when_you_order a_curry it mentions things_like peppers
spinach
etc
but_you never actually see much_of vegetables in_it
it's mostly just overly oily creamy_sauce
my group bought a_few bottles of_wine to_bring
and_once our_table_was cleared
we kept on drinking
what was_nice is_that we_never felt rushed to_leave after_we finished_eating
it_felt like_we stayed an_extra hour afterwards and they_didn't mind at_all
anyways
i_know when_i want an_indian i_will_be here
railway lamb get
in
ma
bellay
i_actually quite liked this_place
it's_not fancy
kinda looks like it's_been decorated by ikea
however for the_concept of quick tapas_style indian street_food you wouldn't really expect_a plush decor
i_came with_a_group_of
organised by me
again
to_try somewhere new around_the lothian rd area and_of_course for_their byob policy
always a_winner at_a team night_out
i_wasn't sure_how the_menu_and concept would_go down_for such a_large_group
the waiter's suggestion of_some set options_for a per head cost were poo poo'd by_the blokes who wanted
their own food
so_i had_to_ask_for a_bit_of paper to_write down everyone's choices against their names so_we_could remember_what we_ordered and keep track
complicated or what
the_waiters were_pretty patient with_us thankfully
the_food turned up_at different times
basically it arrived when_it_was ready
i explained the_concept of_the_place to the_guys a million times_but there_were_a_few moans from people who didn't_have their_food when some had dishes
the moans stopped when everyone had_at least of their_dishes in_front_of them
the_quality_of_the_food was unquestionable though
very_tasty
i_had mixed pakora
half_of it sneakily nicked by_a work buddy
butter_chicken_and a_lamb_dish with ginger
the_lamb_was my_favourite
the_selection_of naan_breads were_great soft
buttery
crispy
no_one had_any complaints with_the_food
the_only options that didn't go down as_well_as_the others were_the mini indian burgers
well
what_do you_expect ordering a_burger in_an_indian_restaurant
and some_kind_of cold chickpea mush on crisp things
the_people who ordered that option both didn't expect it_to_be a_cold dish and_felt the_menu description was_completely different to_what arrived
i'd go_back again_but in_a much smaller group
it's far too complicated keeping track of dishes_for large parties
my control freak tendencies were pushed to_the limit on_this visit
p
s
nice
clean toilets
with toothbrushes
i_have_been eyeing this_restaurant up_for ages and finally_got the_chance_to go last_night_and it_was_amazing
such a_good_selection_of small indian tapas plates ranging_from
and everything_we_had was_delicious
they suggested between plates per_person but myself_and my_friend_had between us and_we_were stuffed
we_shared_the butter_chicken
so_tasty
the fishcakes
somosas
kebab buns
like little burgers
garlic chicken_and aubergine and_potato and_everything just tasted wonderful
such_good quality_and tasty_food
the_restaurant_is byob as_well
on wine_and beer
so_is great_for_a bigger group as will keep_the costs for_dinner down
they_also cater for larger groups
when_we_were in there_was a_large_group of and_there_was plenty of room
the_restaurant_is large too and really_well spaced out the_decor_is quirky with large wooden tables_and wire lampshades so it_does remind you of grabbing a_quick bite in_an_indian train station
which_i loved
they_also have bollywood posters on_the walls_and indian music_playing
making the_whole experience that bit_more inclusive you_could forget for a_minute that_you were_at the_top_of tollcross
the_staff_were also_really friendly_too
this_is_definitely a_new favourite of_mine and_i_have_been raving about_it to_everyone since last_night
tasty_food
great choice and lovely surroundings go
i_have_been thinking_about heading to_the recently opened tuk_tuk on lothian road for quite a_while
i_had_heard rumours they would_come and_pick you up_in_the tuk_tuk if you asked nicely too
the_idea behind it is_that_it_is more_of_a street_food rather than your usual curry experience
there_are lots_of small dishes that_you_can chose from_and enjoy_a tapas_style sharing dinner
they suggest ordering to of_the small dishes per_person perfect_for sharing
i_really_like_the laid back d_cor and bollywood posters
plus the_music is_great to
it_has_a very_happy chatty atmosphere to_it which creates the_right feelings for_our
celebration meal
we_were_all pretty hungry before entering the_restaurant
and_the delicious smells that hit us as we_walked_in meant we_couldn't wait to_sit down_and order
to_start we_decided_to share the_chicken lollipops and_samosas
the spiced wings are_served on_the bone and_the coating of keralan spices on_the beautifully crisp exterior complimented the beautifully tender meat on_the_inside
the_samosas_were good but_i much prefer_the bigger ones you_get from the_indian shops as_they have_more filling
it_was_still a flavourful
moreish starter
leaving us excited for what_was to_come
we ordered_the_tandoori meat selection which comprised of lots_of meat
it's a_bit_more expensive at_about i_think but has different cuts of lamb_and_chicken all_very well_cooked and_really nicely seasoned which went_well with_our other_dishes including_the chole frankie a wrap filled_with spiced chickpeas
herbs
pickled vegetables_and chutney and_the sag paneer creamy spinach_and cubes_of home_made cottage_cheese
i always_order this_dish everywhere we_have an_indian and this_was_one_of_the_best i_have_had
we accompanied our dishes_with pilau_rice
peshwari nan_and our own byob bottles of beer_and_wine
by the_end_of_the_meal we_were absolutely stuffed_and very_happy
the_staff_were really_friendly and_just left us_to chat we_ended_up staying almost an_hour after our_meal without realising
i_think tuk_tuk definitely scores highly for good_food_and laid back dining
i_would_highly_recommend it
controlling food spending but_not managing to_find_a pizza house to obtain a chickeny pizza with bbq sauce base to scoff outdoors in_the meadows on_a sunny day we_found ourselves at tuk_tuk
first_time_here and_had_to ask_if they_were open as_we entered there_was no_one else in
after quizzing staff on_this we_found out the_reason it_was_a sunny day and_everyone would_be in_the meadows eating sausages or pizza
but_they_were booked heavily for later on
so_we_had choice_of any table
and_had_the whole restaurant_to ourselves
it defo wasn't_a crowded house
too warm to_drink beer
which they_don't_have anyway
only soft_drinks
we were_offered bottles of chilled still water
but_had also brought our own bottle
a_short time later
some food_arrived
so found_out the washrooms were downstairs
knowing when_i_got back_the remainder of_food would_be there
venturing into_the basement was_like there had previously been_the perfectly cool wine cellar or old bank with_plenty places_to store that precious metal or paper currency
there_was three of_us at leven street's tuk_tuk
and_they managed_to satisfy our hunger pangs with_lots_of small variations of_lamb and chickeny portions such_as chook lollipops
tandoori style
butter chooks
bun chook kebabs with salad leafs and patina lamb
that were_all complimented with a_variety_of spicy mint dips
in_addition_to rice_and fries
to_give_them four possibly five_stars would_be for creating an golden authentic styled establishment
not bowing to_an inclusive mixture_of other cuisines
seven dam fine flavours_and cost for_three happy excited campers ish
the_place_is bright_and quite comfortable to plant your derri re
and_has bollywood styled music to complete that_indian feeling
but simply another great month old toddler that tollcross has_to offered the_good folks of_edinburgh
makes_me start_to wonder is_this now_the gastronomic area_of the_city
see ya soon tuk_tuk
for_another great afternoon
very_accommodating staff in what is_clearly a_busy and popular establishment
rustled up two extra chairs for_us no problem when_they discovered the party's increased size hadn't been noted down from_our secondary phonecall
service after we'd ordered_was noticeably delayed but_we put this down_to the_way the orders are scheduled in_the_kitchen
once the_food started to_arrive it_was_all on_the_table in quick succession
no_complaints about any_of_the numerous dishes_we_ordered
i_took_my better half here_for_dinner last_night for_his birthday
tuk_tuk had_been on_our radar for_a_while but we_hadn't yet got around_to visiting
as_we_were going_to the cinema at fountainpark in_the afternoon we decided_to_go here_after
i totally forgot to_take_a photo of_the_food
sorry robyn
but it_looked as_good_as_it tasted
this super informal restaurant_is home to a_lovely chilled environment with nice staff and_great_food
what more could you ask_for
also
it_is byob with free corkage
so nip next_door_to scotmid
grab_a cheapy bottle_of_wine and settle in tuk_tuk for the_evening
the_menu contains a vast array_of authentic_indian street_food dishes
we_order about dishes to_share between us
including lamb
veg_and chicken
accompanied by a_couple_of delicious cheese naans and_a roti
i_can't_remember the_exact dishes_we_ordered but_everything was_so full_of_flavour and_tasty
i_would_recommend going_there and_just ordering_a variety_of_dishes that_you have_no_idea what they_are
my_only criticism
and why i_haven't given it_stars
was_that the_food_wasn't hot
temperature
it_was_all pretty luke warm
however
this_is easily fixed and i'm_sure we'll be_back there_again very_soon
highly_recommend_it
had_to_wait forever_to get fed here
which didn't do much for_my grumbly and unreliable tummy
the_other problem for_me is_that most_of_the_food is spicy
which_is a_bit_of an_issue when you've got_a sensitive gut like_me
too_much info
despite asking the_waitress for_the least spicy options
what turned up still had_me sweating
i_liked_the atmosphere_of the_restaurant_and the_idea_of street_food
we_were_in a_group_of nine people so quite a_few folk ordered_the set menu
which_was never ending and_seemed pretty_good value_for_money
again
quite long waits between servings so not_an ideal option if_the place_is_really busy
i_opted_for two veggie_dishes and_a naan_bread i_think one_of_the_dishes was_a daal and_the_other was_a potato_and aubergine dish
they_were both nice
but_the spice_was too_much_for me despite the_waitress saying they_weren't too_hot
what can i_say
i'm_a wimp
the_portion_sizes weren't spectacular as you'd_expect from_a joint that does indian tapas
and_that combo just_about filled me_up
it_was_all just
well
okay
i_see quite a_lot_of folk like_this_place
but the_combo of_spice
long_wait and tapas didn't_really do_it for_me
maybe another visit needs_to happen when less packed
or_maybe it's_just_not for_me
too_much spicy spicy
great_restaurant with funky decor_and enough talking points to_keep the_most hard pressed for conversation diners occupied
staff_were a_little_off
chap wasn't sure_what each_dish was
unable to answer questions we posed
another girl seemed_to forget she'd handed us_a menu_for further orders
prompting us to_get her attention
so a_bit lax in_that respect
but the_fact we_wanted_to order more says a_lot about_the_place
the_food_is damn tasty
set out in_a tapas_style fare
tuk_tuk recommends a_good or dishes per_person so as to_get_a wide feel for the_menu
although they_don't offer much in_the way_of seafood
the_chicken
lamb_and veggie_dishes they produce are flavoursome and plentiful
i forget the_names
and_as the_website is currently down am unable to blag it
but_i_would particularly recommend the_chicken on_the bone
cooked_in lime and pickle
and_the wee veggie parcels that
as the_menu says
need_to_be tasted to_be believed
and such good_value
we must've nailed a_good dishes
on_top_of_that a roti_and naans
to receive a bill to_the tune of
the_fact they_are byob
and_don't charge for corkage
is_a massive help in this_area
i will_certainly be_back
thursday curry club will want_to know of_this_place
and_i recommend you_go too
now
really cool decor
great tasting_food
check_out_the lucky mondays
rolled the dice and managed to_get_the meal for_free
all_the little plates of_indian_food
lamb on_the bone with_spinach
oh eh gee
that kind of overshadows all_the_dishes in_my memory
as_it_was so_delicious
but_the channa daal
and_other wee things_were all_delicious too
even_the little pots of pickles with_the popadoms were_great
although they_were small_and not_much pickle in each wee pot
there's_also a photo booth where you_can take stupid photos of yourself
or beautiful ones
if you're inclined
and they'll upload directly to_their fb page
fun times
a bustly
busy
friendly
quick_service restaurant
byob
delicious_food
great fun
i_would certainly go_back
hmmmm i_was_a_little disappoint ed with tuk_tuk truth be told
after hearing and reading lots_of great thinks i_was_really underwhelmed
the_service_was_a bith all_over_the place
took times of asking to_get_some water
the_food portions for what_you_pay are_reasonable
the cooking of the_food_itself i_had_a slight issue with
the seasoning was either over bearing or non existent depending on_the dish
the_naan_was very_light and tasty_but perhaps small_for_the_price as were the_rice portions
i_can_see why it_has and will_do well but not_really my kind o thing
f
the_last_time_i visited tuk_tuk
i_was_really impressed
the_food_was fresh_and_tasty
and the_concept of tapas_style indian_food_was a novel concept for_me
the_place_was buzzing and it_felt like i'd been temporarily transported from_the bitter cold of_edinburgh to_a bollywood film set in mumbai
so i_was_quite excited_to return_for a second_visit
alas
i_was_a_bit disappointed
on my_second trip
we_made the mistake of not booking beforehand and_so had_to_wait for_a_while
mins
before a_table was free
we_were asked to_take_a seat in a_little room off the_main restaurant
where there_was another couple waiting
unfortunately
more_people were invited into_the room and_it became a_bit claustrophobic
however we were_offered water_and menus whilst we_waited
we_were shown to_our_table
one_of_the canteen style long benches
and_then it_was as if_we_were forgotten about
no_one came to_take_our_order
and_it_was only after_i signalled to one_of_the waiters that_we_were given attention
i_got_the impression that there_were_a_few senior staff who_were stressed at having_to manage the_less experienced staff
there seemed_to be a_lot_of staff running around
which does on_one hand add_to the_street food_experience the_restaurant_is trying_to offer
but came across as_being a_bit disorganised
tuk_tuk operates on_the basis of first cooked
first served
so our_dishes trickled out over_the course_of ten_minutes
unfortunately
they_forgot about the_mango_lassi i_ordered and_i only received this nearer the_end_of_the_meal
we_also_had to remind staff about_our indian 'snack pot' that never arrived
the_food_itself
though
is_great
the_butter_chicken i_ordered trumped any prior tikka massala i've tried and_the_chicken
basically chicken nuggets in_a sweet sauce
was pretty_tasty
my selection_of vegetable_pakoras were_pretty good_too
the_mango_lassi_was worth_the_wait
my only_complaint food wise was_that_the rice portions_are a_bit conservative
or_maybe that's_just compared_to the load of_rice normally served_in takeaways
overall
we_were each for around dishes
rice_and_a naan
and those indian snacks
staff_were generally friendly_but flustered
still
i'll probably go_again
if only for_another dose of_that butter_chicken
lovely indian_style tapas restaurant
my_boyfriend and_i_went_to tuk_tuk because we_didn't just want one or_two indian_dishes
we_wanted_to eat from several
that's exactly what_we_got
busy
buzzing atmosphere was_great in_this byob spot
a_few pointers
must get
butter_chicken
steer clear
saag_paneer never has paneer been so salty_and saag just_like wilted spinach
byob
there_is_an off license just_a_few doors down_on the_side street
basic beer_and very basic wine selection
tapas small plates
all_of_the selections are pretty_small
we_had_the following and_were full
mumbai burgers
one burger
samosas
chutney
pappadom
x
kurkure
sag paneer
again
skip it
raste ke biryani
butter_chicken
peshwari_naan
garlic_naan
great concept
smart execution
slight yuppie smugness
they advertise authentic_indian fast_food and_have_a very simple menu
i_ordered_the_chicken curry
mild
which had_a_lot_of flavor_and even a_little bite
i_ordered_the combo to_go which_comes with rice_and_naan but_they forgot_to include the_naan in my_order
the_dish_was mostly rice_with very_little gravy but did_have some large chicken pieces in_it
for
with tax i_didn't_feel it_as that_great of_a value
even if_i_had received the_naan
the_place just_opened and_you_can tell they_are still working out_the kinks
maybe i'll try_it_again in a_few_months to_see_if things have improved but until then i'll stick_to what_i know
excited i_remembered that_this_place opened soon
i stopped_in_for indian 'fast food'
i_ordered chole with_rice portion
naan
the gentleman who took my_order forgot_to give_me my change and_after i_told_him
he_gave me my dollar back_in dimes
i_waited approx
minutes_for my 'fast food'
the chole was_ok
the_rice_was rice_and_the naan_was_great
like the_first reviewer
i_didn't_think the_value was_that great
i'm no pig but_even i could've had_more
when i_go_back i'll_have to_get_the big plate
full serving_of rice whole piece_of_naan
but_then we're talking
a_bit much_for fast_food
i_will_go_back
though
they_just opened_and i_don't_want a_food option like_this to_go away without a_chance
i_was_surprised to_see_this place
the_idea_of indian fast_food had_not occurred to_me_and it_was_really_good
good_food
great_service
mango mastani rocks
i_am_giving this_place the_extra star_for_the service
they_are_a mom_and_pop place and_you_can see they_are trying really hard_to please which_is quite endearing
however
efficiency of service_is some_time away as they_do_have some kinks there
as_it relates to_the_food
the taste_is average
by no means bad
but_nothing stellar yet
i_have_been_here twice and_each_time thought the_food_was_just ok
i_had also thought they_serve indo_chinese which would_have_been a_huge plus for_me but_it hasnt been on_the_menu everytime_i have_gone
they_are still in start up mode so need_to_be given a_chance
i_may go_back in months to_check up_on that
this_place_has good_stuff
have_tried the_chicken_biryani and vada pav
both_were good especially_the vada pav
the_lassi was_a let down for_me_and my_friends too
the_other stuff that my_friends liked were_the kababs and_some_of_the curries
they_were disappointed_by_the mango mastani and bhel
it_looks_like a_family_run restaurant_and_the day we_went the_service wasn't up_to_the mark as some_of_the employees had_not reported to_work
the_owner apologized for_it as_we_were leaving
hence haven't reduced a_star
it_would_be better_to give_them_a call and_order before going_to avoid waiting time
look_for the
t
and the_chili sign on_the corner_of the_building
simple
super casual presentation of_your indian favorites
as part_of my ongoing quest to understand and sample the_cuisine of_india about which i_know little
i ventured to tadka sizzles on tuesday for_lunch since nearby bawarchi is closed on tuesdays
good spicyness in chicken_biryani
good rice body
not sticky or too wet
cooked to_order may take minutes
and we_were_the_only table
be_warned
mango_lassi too yogurt ey
i_need_to make_this more often at_home
garlic_naan doughey and bland
signage advertised a_lunch_buffet
but the_bar has_been mothballed
barely usable ikea
matchstick
plastic furniture barely serves
i_don't_care i'm here for_the_food
styro
plastic and paper rule the fray
it_doesn't stop me_from enjoying this_place
but come_on
i'm starting an eco violator list
i_picked up some_indian_food from_here
we_had_the lamb_biryani and_a_couple of_the_curries
the_biryani was_good_but not_as spicy as_i_had requested
the_curries
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_curry
etc
were_okay
i_was_really craving_some good_indian_food for_take_out
with my_favourite place being about_a twenty minutes drive from_me
i_decided_to find something a_little closer
i settled on tadka sizzles after_looking at_the_menu options
i_called them_to try_and place my_order
no answer
went straight to voice mail
i_waited a_few_minutes and_decided_to try_again
again
it went_to voicemail
they_have_an option_of ordering online
so_i try_that and it_takes me_to a broken link as their_website is currently under maintenance
i_believe it's_very poor business etiquette to_not answer your business phone
twice
in_a row
bad_food i never_had before_but food_is_not having good quailty but the_nan is_to salty that_i_had last_night i_will call to health deportment to_come thear
if_i_could go_to_the buffet every_week
i_would
it's_so inexpensive for all_you_can_eat
it_was_an all_around great_experience
i_heard of_this_place by word_of mouth
and figured that a_buffet full_of foods i'd never_tried before would_be so amazing
i_was_very pleased
we_got rounds of_food plus dessert
there_isn't much_of a_dessert selection
but_i preferred to_fill_up on_all of_their other food anyways
i had_dinner_here yesterday while passing through cambridge and i_was_pleasantly_surprised
great_variety of_meat and veg_dishes
great nan
and_a dedicated fruit station
wonderful value
i_am still full today
the_atmosphere isn't anything to_write_home_about but who cares when_the_food is_this good_and this affordable
incredible service_and friendly_staff
this_place_is_a gem
incredibly good_value_for your money
you can't_go_wrong
omg yummy
my_husband_and_i love_indian_food but have_been hard pressed to_find a_good_one in_our area
or search is over
fusion has a_wonderful selection_of curries_and beautiful fresh_naan
the_tandoori_chicken is_amazing
inexpensive too
almost half the_price_of comparable indian_buffet
truly amazing
excellent value
very_good_food and seriously excellent_service
last time we_went_there was_no veggie_korma on_the_buffet
our favourite dish
our_waiter immediately went_to_the kitchen and_had_the chef prepare a_small bowl_of veggie_korma especially for_us at no additional charge
now_that is service
we_have always found the_food hot_and delicious
at
for_the dinner_buffet
it_is_a real bargain
in_addition_to a_great many entrees including vegetarian_options
there_is_a salad_bar that includes fruit
and kheer
indian rice_pudding
other desserts and ice_cream
a_take_out container from the_buffet_is
the afghan style bar b q chicken_is particularly nice
and_of_course there_is_also the_tandoori_chicken as_well_as_a mint chicken
the_curries range from mild to medium to hot
and_there_is_a large_selection of vegetable_dishes
the roasted veggies are_delicious
all in_all who can_say more
this_is_the_best_indian_food we've_had in_years and_we try to_return at_least_once_a month
we_live more_than an hour's drive away or we_would be_going much_more often
newly opened on st mary's street
vinyasa is_a_very smart indian curry_house
their lunchtime menu
with
and
options
is_excellent value
everything about the_first is_extremely good
from the_decor to the_service to_the_food on_offer
we'd recommend a_visit
next_time the_curry mood takes you
overall
we_said
vinyasa was_extremely impressive
we_have_a really_good range_of indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
and_this fits in nicely towards the_top end_of that happy band
i_strongly urge you to_pay it a_visit
at_your earliest convenience
rather excitingly
they_do takeaway
also
so if_you_can't make_it along to_the_restaurant
just lift the_phone
or order online
to_sample their delights
the_good people_of vinyasa looked after us very_well and_couldn't have_been more attentive
menu suggestions were_well judged and the_food_was_excellent
they're relatively new
but_have created a_lovely family_run restaurant_in_the heart of edinburgh's old_town
i_had lamb
which_i often do with_indian_food
and_it_was lovely tender_and full_of_flavour
my_wife_and_i ate_here while on_our honeymoon
and_we loved_it
the_waitstaff was exceedingly friendly_and_helpful and_the_food_was terrific
my_wife has_a serious nut allergy that extends to chickpeas and_lentils
which make indian_food difficult
but the_manager at vinyasa went out_of his way to_help us find_some dishes_that were completely safe and_delicious
if_you_are looking_for great_indian_food
in_a well run restaurant_with a_pleasant atmosphere
i_highly_recommend vinyasa
the boyfriend_and_i were_in need of dinner while on_the southside of_town the_other week
since we_hadn't had_a curry_in ages
vinyasa came_to mind as i'd read a_few reviews_and thought_it_was about time to_give_it_a_try
the_restaurant_is located_on st mary's street
so in_a good location for tourists especially those just across the_road in_the travelodge
but_it's clear that_this_place isn't just trying_to attract the out_of towners as the_interior_is very chic
with friendly waiting staff
and a_good variation of_curries on_the_menu
also_the prices_are_pretty much the_same_as most_other curry restaurants_in_town
so clearly not_been hiked up_for_the tourist trade
we_were_seated as_soon_as_we arrived as the_restaurant wasn't too_busy
but became busier as we_ate our_dinner
the_menu_has good variation
but_not_the overwhelming amount of_options that_some other_restaurants may_have
we_opted to skip a_starter and_share some poppadums with_a pickle tray instead
i_ordered_the_chicken katmandu and_the boyfriend went_with_a chicken jalfrezi
our poppadums arrived quickly with_the pickle tray and_two cobra beers
i_feel_like it's_pretty hard_to not_make a_good poppadum
so hard_to comment on these
but_the pickle tray had nice spicy onions
a_tasty mango_chutney
and_my_boyfriend confirmed that_the lime pickle was_also quite_good
our main_dishes arrived fairly quickly
attributed to_the_restaurant not_being too_busy
and_we soon had our chicken_curries in_front_of us_with pilau_rice and a_basket_of garlic_nan
now_i like a_bit_of spice_in my_curry
but_not so_much_that i_can't taste_the flavour of_the_dish
i_felt that the_spice in_my katmandu was judged very_well
as_it_was warming but_i could also taste_the coriander
cinamonn
and_other spices_in it
the pilau_rice made a_good accompainment and_the nan_bread was garlicy and_soft so very_good for_dipping in the_curry
my_boyfriend seemed equally pleased with_his jalfrezi
my_only real grip with_this_place is_that for_two main_dishes
a_rice
a nan
some popppadums
and_two beers the_bill was which seems a_bit steep to_me
the_prices on the_main_dishes seemed reasonable
about each
so_it must_have been_the side_dishes that added up so quickly
but_the_food_was quite_tasty and_the_service friendly so it's_hard_to really fault them
it's_definitely good to_know that_this_place open especially as it_will come_in handy when we're needing a_good feed before a festival night_out
we booked online and_they provided us a_discount which_was_a welcome surprise
the_atmosphere_was pleasant and_modern and_the_food_was great_as_well
on_a_saturday around_pm they_only_had one other_table
so reservations were_not necessary
not_sure if_they_are much busier for_dinner but_as a_result the_service_was_good and the_food_came_out quickly
we_had_some delicious curries which_were rich_and flavorful_and had just_the_right_amount_of heat
meat samosa
deep_fried savoury pastries with minced lamb served_with
a_special sauce_and accompanied with salad
garlic_naan
bread stuffed_with coriander and_garlic cooked in_our clay_oven
tikka massalam with_chicken
kebabs cooked_in_a mild flavoured sauce_with herbs and_spices
bhuna with_chicken
traditional medium strength dish cooked with_onions
herbs
tomatoes
and a_variety_of spices
tarka dhal
lentils served_with_a touch of_garlic
good northern quisine
tandoori ovens and_pleasant interior
watch out for_the olives in martina's as they_have hot chillis
surprising in_a casino to have_such international choices
the_staff_is okay and_service fair
the important thing_is the_food_and it_is_good
omg
i_wish we_had found this_restaurant the_day_we arrived in_vegas
the_buffet_is under and the_food_on the_buffet_is extremly fresh
the_chicken_tandoori is so_delicious
the_basmati_rice is delicate and_had authentic flavors
the_naan
bread
was_out_of_this_world
we_also_had_a very_fresh salads
and the_lentil dish_was exquisite
try the_sweet_rice with_fresh fruit
delicious
now you_should see the_decor of this_restaurant
it's spacious and luxurious
like_an island in_the heart of the_hotel rio
it's_a greatly non smoking space
thank god for_that
i_have_to add_to my_review the extremly welcoming
warm
attention ate
details oriented service
everyone_in this_restaurant_is an absolute sweetheart
i_will defently comeback
this_is_a gordon's hell kitchen experience
i_came out of_this_place felt_like_i was robbed
for_over usd per head
we_had less than average_food
with_no favors
and clueless service
they at least got the_bill right
though
if_you_don't believe what_i_am about to_say
just_go there_and see_that the_restaurant_is empty for_dinner
and
even_better
go_in and_have dinner_and experience it yourself
be_sure_to share
we_made a_reservation for_dinner on_a_saturday of may
thinking the_restaurant will_be crowded because its vegas
we checked out the_menu before hand
and_saw that_they_have fairly expensive offering main_courses for
vegetarian_dishes for
so_we_had reasonable expectations of a_decent meal
when_we_arrived at
pm
we see_that the_restaurant_is basically empty
there's only_one other_table
i_felt something was wrong
but_then i_thought may be it's too early for vegas_and people_are not coming in yet
i_was wrong
i_was debating the_okra vs
veg
biryani
so_i_asked the_waitress what_kind_of vegetables they_have in the_biryani
she said
peas
so
rice and_peas for
what
is_that even a_meal
ok
so_we_ordered the_paneer for appetizer
okra and lamb_curry as main_courses
and nan_and rice
which_is also rice and_peas
but_for
the_paneer came
and_i_know we shouldn't have_come
it_was basically dry_and have very_little favor
it_tasted more_like paper than cheese
when the_waitress came_with our_main course
she blatantly commented that_she has no_idea who ordered which dish
there were_only tables
well
you_could have handled that by saying
lamb
obviously its her first day
though_i have_to_admit she doesn't_have many customers to practice her skills
the_okra was_extremely sour
i_tried very hard to_eat as_much_as_i can as_we don't_have time_for another_meal due_to_a scheduled evening show
i_think_i ate may be of the_okra
it_was_so sour and_dry that i_can't figure out whether they_are rotten for months or someone had washed their feet with the_okra
then
i_tried some_of_the lamb_curry from_my wife's dish
the_meat tasted more_like goo
and_the source is more_like_a puree than a_curry
it's_just the_wrong thing
and
for usd you_get_a small bowl may be cm in diameter
not_that we_would want any more_than what_we_got
the_rice_was below average
couldn't taste too_much of_it because_of_the sour okra
the_nan_was ok
and_its the_only_thing they_didn't mess up
in_the_middle_of dinner
another waitress came_by with beer_and asked_if_we had_ordered beer
we_did_not there_are like three tables at_that time
how_can you possibly mess that up
getting the_check was_really slow too
but i_don't_care too_much about_that
the_final bill tips was_over
which_is_the most expensive meal we had_in_vegas until that point
and the_worst we've_had in_many years
it's simply worse than some_of_the very average indian_cuisine you_can find_in california
we_had_a meal the_next_day at_the eiffel tower restaurant which_is reasonably worth_it
finally
i_have_to_say this_place fits exactly into_the definition of gordon ramsey's hell's kitchen highly over_priced
clueless front_of house
food lack_of favor
and above all
no customers_and hemorrhaging cash
if_they don't_get a_major ramsey make over
these_guys are_just going_to continue_to burn money_and close up
don't_go here
from some_of_the_other reviews
they may_have a_decent lunch
but_i_am not_going_to try
just_like its name nothing is special about_this_place
it's_in_a casino so its overpriced and low quality
there_is no wow factor and_the_buffet is_not_the world's largest
i_would stick_to off_the_strip for_indian
a_fast_food indian gourmet with live entertainment and_modern deco would_have worked better
no signature dishes_and_the bar is_small_and hidden and nothing_special
i_would_have made_it into bhangara bar with fusion tapas
went_here with_a_group_of friends and_the_service wasn't great
food_was_ok
i_don't_think i_will_be_coming back_here_again
the_server gave us the_wrong check_and charged the_wrong amount of_money on_the credit_card
didn't refill water
tea or coke
we_went_to the
am to pm
lunch_buffet
we_had_been there twice before for_dinner when_it_was gaylord and_both experiences were_quite similar
nice_ambiance
good
but overpriced food
lousy service
so i_was_excited they_were back
same owners
new name
and could_do a_major affordable chow down and_not have_to worry_about the_service because_it_was a_buffet
really
what could possibly go_wrong
so_there we_are nobody to seat us so_i poke my_head into the_dining_area and someone comes and ushers us_to a_table in_a near empty room
i_look around
wow design fallout
the gaylord to_india bistro remodel is more_of_a demodel
what_was once a_rather upscale and attractively appointed space has_been dehabbed with cheesy booths and_a tacky over bright chandelier
oh_well
moving on
the_buffet consisted_of
dal maharani
baingan pakoras
eggplant
aloo baingan
think_it_was potato_and eggplant
palak_paneer
basmati_rice
tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka_masala
chicken_curry
and_some expired salad
a_little heavy on the_chicken_and eggplant
but_i_was still ok with_that
until i_discovered that_every chicken_dish was_a contender for_the_food despair jackpot
the_one commonality they_all shared was_their styrofoam taste_and consistency
it_was_the worst rice i_have_ever_had and_we debated if_it_was old or undercooked
settling on_the notion that_it_was probably both
everything else pretty much sucked as_well
there_are people starving in
fill in_the blank
and_they would_probably choose hunger over that buffet
the_only plus
our_server kept us attentively stocked with the_only palatable things we_had
garlic_naan water
joined a_few friends_who enjoy this_place
it_was recently remodeled so had_a fresh look
we_sat towards_the back where_we could look out to_the pool of the_rio
service_was_quick and_friendly
we_ordered a_variety_of items
i_enjoyed_the tandoori items along_with the_naan
my_friends had_some vegetable and chicken_curries that_they raved_about
would_love_to try_this_place again on my_next_visit
worst experience i_have_ever_had in_a casino
my_sister and_i_had read about_this_place in_the weekly and_were excited to_go
my_sister has_a nut allergy and_has had issues at_other local indian_restaurants so_i made_sure to_ask several_times what had nuts and_what did_not
i_was_told nothing had nuts
as_soon as_she took the_first bite she_could tell something was wrong
i_called our_waitress over and_asked again about nuts
i_took them about_minutes to figure out_what had nuts by which point i_had already run to_the gift shop for emergency benadryl
the_server told her she_could try something else to_eat_and that the_only_thing on_the_buffet with_nuts was what she_had eaten
she_was clearly too sick to_eat so_i informed the_staff that_we would_be leaving
at_this_point the_staff brought_me the_bill for_my buffet
despite the_fact_that my_plate was_still full
i_will_never again patronize this_restaurant_and plan_to call a manager as_well
very average indian_food
their daal is_good_and the_naan_is delicious
it's absolutely fresh
crispy_and is full_of_flavor
everything else on_the_menu was_a miss for_me
lacked flavors
the_service_is_good and the_place_looks renovated and new
the deserts are_served cold but_if u request them they_will be_happy_to heat up the_gulab_jamun and halwa
if_you_are really craving_indian_food and_want_to give it_a_shot try their_buffet
i_will_definitely not recommend_this_place for_dinner
save ur money
the_buffet_is tax tip and all_you_can_eat
the_lunch_buffet_is ok
the_tandoori_chicken
chicken_tikka_masala_and naan are_good
the_rest_of the_buffet_was either dying in_the chafing dish or_not very appetizing
the_yogurt curry_was sour
the_saag was desiccated and the_salad looked a_bit_on the dead side
but_for
in_vegas
having enough good dishes to_fill you_up is passable
i_am_an avid follower of northern_indian food and_i_am quite comfortable knowing how indian_food should taste
i_have_not found anywhere better on_the_west coast for_indian_food besides royal india bistro
their_naan_is preciously cooked along_with the_tandori_chicken
spices_are accurate and_not overdone
there_is generous sampling_of all meats in_all dishes
i_love_the remodel in_that the_tables and booths are comfortable
the_place_is very_clean
service_is attentive
and_i_would take the_chance_to eat_there at any_time i_could
i_cannot recommend_this_place enough
the wooden elephants in_the_middle_of a casino sure beckon your indulgence for_indian_food
me_and a_friend_of_mine from la
went_there
the_place_is not_for_the someone looking_for_a cheap chinese buffet where you_need a_food taster on_a retainer
to_see you_will survive the ordeal
almost_all the chinese restaurants_in_vegas are filthy and dirty rat holes except_for_the panda express outlets
exposed on_a daily basis
by chanel tv
they_are swarming with cockroaches
i_saw one_was as big as king kong
sitting cross legged
on_an easy chair
the_meat is_not brought at traditional butcher or reputable supply houses or suppliers
but from unknown sources and_no_one has any idea which animal it_came from
then_the illegal chinese workers live_in the_kitchen_and bathe in_the_kitchen and they_also double as cooks
dishwashers and cleaning staff and_they_are closed for cleaning one_day a_year
a disability and life insurance is a_good_thing before eating in_there
the_only word they speak is
enjoy
which sounds like an_order to_be complied
if_not the fortune cookie will_have even sterner message in broken english
in this_restaurant
i_prefer to_order fish kabob
since_they are_more north_indian than south
the kabob is_a dry item and_the cooking process removes any_kind_of fish aroma
i suggested this_to my_friend who devoured this so_much he came_back with_his family few_months later and_ate to_the hearts content
the_food_is_fresh_and healthy and you_have_to know what_to_order
not_to_mention you_are paying three_times the_price for_the luxury of dining inside a casino and_the overhead is three time higher than_a strip joint
the chicken_pakora is_another delicacy that is_perfect as_an_appetizer when_you_are relaxing with_a chilled red_wine
the_place_was called gaylord before and_the decoration was_awful and_the newer remodeling is nothing_to brag about
the eatery is_too well lighted for my_tastes and loses the romantic appeal that_you seek when_you_are paying this kind of_money but the_fish kabob is_just out_of_this_world
other dry items i_like is the_tandoori assortment with fish
chicken and_shrimp of_course the_mango kulfi and pistachio kulfi that_is delectable if served like_an ice_cream not_like a_hard cake
i_went_in here with_a_friend for_their_lunch_buffet
it's_definitely got very_good ambiance_and location
everything's a_bit fancier than the_usual indian_place
fancy ceilings
plush carpet
cute buffet setup
comfy booths
but the_buffet fare was_definitely lacking a_bit_of excitement
they_only_had a limited variety_and i_go_to many indian_lunch_buffets
so_i_know the_standard options
but_this_place didn't_have paneer
or korma
however
they carried carrot pudding so that_was something_to point_out
drier than usual but_it_was_still pretty_good
the_servers_were very_nice but_also very forgetful
maybe she_was new but her attitude about everything_was_very pleasant
i_wouldn't come_here again but_was glad_to have_tried out another indian_joint
what_a_great find_at the_rio hotel
not_a_fan_of buffets
atmosphere was_wonderful
didn't hear the slot machines
quite
elegant atmosphere
service_was warm_and_friendly
genuine
food was_more_than adequate
friend_and_i could_have split the_meal sampler
couldn't finish all_the wonderful dishes
they_didn't all taste the_same
great spices_and fresh
next_time in_lv
a_definite go_again
visited royal india bistro an_hour ago_with my_girlfriend_and wanted to_give_this restaurant a_review straight away
our host rahul was_really polite_and helpful
the_service too is impeccable
the_chef cooked a_dish for_me that_wasn't on_the_menu_and it_came_out fantastic
ive visited a_handful_of indian_restaurants_in_vegas and this_is_the_best so_far
thank_you for_our wonderful meal
formerly known as gaylord
royal india bistro can_be found_in the_exact same place as_it_was before inside the_rio casino
with the_same owner and_almost the_same menu
the_interior of_this_place is_now more sophisticated
plush and cozy with spacious booths lining around the_walls of_the_restaurant
i_remembered fondly from_my past visits
as_this was_my_favorite indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
the_delicious and_creamy
korma
entrees
be it chicken
lamb
or vegetable
korma_is always amazing on_top_of fluffy basmati_rice
there_is no words to_describe the_taste and the_feeling of the_first few spoonful of lamb_korma_and rice
really
you_just have_to experience it
indian_food just isn't the_same after tasting this item because you'll want to_come_back
again and_again
for_more of_this delicious_and heavenly korma curry
i_don't_know_if i_can ever order anything else on_the_menu here i'm too spoiled by_this item and_i'll just want what i_love
over_and over again
sure
they_have really_great curry_and chicken_tandoori
creamy spinach
cauliflower and carrots
but addiction has its limit as_my tummy is_only limited in space
the_items to_get here
if you ever come_here
is the_korma
lamb
chicken_or vegetable
creamy spinach_and cauliflower
trust_me
you_will_not_be_disappointed
this has_to_be the_best indian_restaurant_in_las_vegas
that_is all
i_read other people's reviews_on here_and was_kind_of concerned
i_wanted_to eat_here for_years and never_have until last_night
i_decided_to ignore the_reviews because people have_such different opinions and_it_was also recommended_by one_of_the chef's at_my school
i_have_eaten_at many indian_places and_i_must_say that i_was_surprised the_food_was_great
i_have great_service_and the_atmosphere_was also_great
as far_as the_prices
i_can_see them being a_bit higher than some other_indian_restaurants but keep in_mind
any restaurant in_a casino will_be more expensive
even mcdonald's in_a casino will cost more_for food_than off_the_strip due_to_the high rent
i_went_in for_dinner_and i_was very_happy_with what_i ordered and_i_would totally try_them again
for_lunch is_actually a_good deal_and i_wasn't aware_of that until i_went_in
i_will probably go_back later in the_week to_check_out_the lunch_buffet but_otherwise i really_had no_complaints
i_recommend people try_this out_for themselves to_judge
i_am glad_i_did
eating_here was a_terrible experience
the food_was_okay
but_the_service_was a nightmare
we only_had people_in our_party
but_they acted like we_were an unwieldy large_group
they_forgot some_of our_dishes and beverages
even_after being reminded several_times
the_management was rude when_we tried_to address the_problem
additionally
the plain_rice is outrageously expensive and_they tricked us into ordering far more_than we_needed
save yourself the headache and find somewhere_else to_eat
this_was an surprisingly excellent meal
the_rio is_not_the nicest casino in_las_vegas
but i_will_be_back for_this_restaurant
not_only_is it clean_and quiet
closed off from_the casino
but the_staff_was helpful and_the_food_was superb
they_were_very accommodating when_we_asked about vegan_options
it_was_a_nice respite from_the chaos of_las_vegas
wow
stopped by for_lunch on_a fluke
very nice_decor
excellent_food
good_buffet
best_part_is the_place_was not crowded
no_one knows about_it
it_was closed for_a_while first_time i've been_in for_years
just had_dinner
service_was_great_and staff_was_friendly
my_hubby had_the non_vegetarian complete dinner and_i had_the_chicken_tikka_masala
and_it did_not_disappoint
i'm_not against indian_food
but given choices
i rarely put_it on the_top_of my_list
for_some_reason
when_i checked out this_place
i_decided to_give_it_a_try
i_thought_it_was good
not_great
the_atmosphere_was elegant so_i_was concerned i_was dressed too casually
but noticed other_people were dressed like_me
i_enjoyed my_meal
but like_most india food
it not something_that i crave for again
we recently went there_for_dinner
the_ambiance_is good
its inside rio casino
the_food_was_pretty average
sarso da sag was_good
naan_was_good
other stuff was_average
honestly did_not like samosas
fount it_very greasy_and stuffing was_not great_too
gajar halwa was_tasty
over_all very average_food
but_it_was pricey though
you_might wanna try buffet first
good luck
the_food_and ambiance
fantastic
i_ordered my_food spicy
and boy was_it ever
on_my return_visit i'll go mild
this_place_is super fancy indian with prices to match
but_that being_said the_food_was incredibly delicious and_the_service_was_great
we_went_in with the_groupon and_still paid and did_not_have anything but water to_drink
i_would_recommend_this_place is_you have_an xtra for really_good_indian
try it_out
this_place_has gr food
service_and ambience
hearty vegetarian as_well as meat_dishes
pricey because_of prime location but you_get nice portions and_a classy place
buffet_is first rate too
try the_okra marsala or_any lamb_dish
after_a horribly disappointing week of dining we_found_this gem tucked_away inside the_rio we_arrived just in time for_the_lunch_buffet it_was_the food highlight_of our_trip
everything_was full_of_flavor and wonderfully prepared
the_staff_was amazingly friendly can't_wait_to go_back our_next trip_to_vegas
nice quiet spot_in the_rio
very_affordable lunch_buffet_with sufficient selection
a_great_lunch option if_you_are looking_for an alternative_to the hectic atmosphere
i've_only had_indian_food a_handful_of times in_my_life but_this_place was_good
i_don't_have anything bad to_say about_it
for_appetizers the_garlic_naan_bread
bhaji onion ring type dish_and the_vegetable samsoa are_all worth getting
for main_courses the_chicken_tikka_masala shrimp_vindaloo were_both very_good too
i_would_have to_try_some other_places before_i could compare it but_i definitely_recommend trying this_place_for yourself
service food both solid
very_bad experience_at royal
indian_food_is one_of_my_favorites and_i_was very_excited to_find_a semi upscale indian_restaurant_in a vegas casino
but_what a_disappointment
i_think_we might_have made_a mistake going_for dinner though
in my_experience
indian_restaurants_are typically better for_the_lunch_buffet
service i'm not_really sure whether to complain about service or_not
we_were_not really ignored
but at_the_time we_were_the_only ones in_the_restaurant so not_that hard
i_also felt like the_wait_staff_was trying_to push me to_spend more money the_whole time
they asked_if_i wanted an_appetizer times
asked_if_i wanted_a bottle_of_wine rather than a_glass a_couple_times
asked_if_i wanted to_add sides or extra bread_and weren't clear if_they would_be extra charge
just slightly annoying
also my_entree was_pretty spicy_and they_kept letting my_water go empty
again
we_were_the_only ones there
food i_ordered_the goat masala
which was_one_of_the or items under the_menu section
specialties
when_i see_this in_a_restaurant i_usually assume they mean these_are their best dishes
the_ones they_are known for
the_rice_was pretty_good
its pretty hard_to mess up rice
the_naan_bread_was also pretty_good
the_sauce_was a_little spicier than_i_expected
but i_liked_it
and they_did offer_a milder version
the_problem was the_meat
i've_never_had goat before
but_there has_to_be a_better cut than_what we_were_served
my_dad got the_same_thing as me
it was_some_of_the toughest meat i've ever_had
and_there_were maybe or bites that_were free of fat or gristle
the pieces all had a_big bone in_the_middle and smaller bones throughout
i_kept accidentally biting down_on them_and hurting my teeth
the_masala also_had no vegetables in_it just meat_and sauce_which was_disappointing
to_me at least
the_worst of_it though was how_i felt afterwards
i_don't_want_to say_that it made_me sick
but_i spent a considerable amount of_time late that_night and the_next_day on_the toilet
and_i wasn't hungry the_whole next day
price the_reason this_place_is getting the_worst possible score
for_two_people
one glass_of_wine each and_then water the_rest_of_the time
entree with_no appetizer
no desert it_was
add a tip and you_are getting close_to
i_am_used_to paying that kind of_money to_eat on_the_strip
but_i expect_a certain level_of quality_and service for_that price
and it_was_not met here
bottom_line is_that i_am_not going back_and i_would_not recommend_it_to anyone
at least stay way from the_goat
they_had lots_of selections so_i really didn't_have_to try_everything
i_liked most_of_the_dishes i_tried
i_came_here due_to_a groupon deal and_it_was overall just not_that_great
the_decor is_very_nice_and elegant but_not reflective of the_quality_of_food
the stand_out items_were the chicken_wings and_tikka_masala
the_naan_bread_was too firm and just_not fresh
the_price to food_quality ratio is_not worth_going
the venue is designated to_cater_to tourists and casino guests
this is_hands_down the_best masala_sauce i've ever_had
anywhere
period
the people_are beautifully friendly_and_the number_of vegan choices available is_fantastic
i'll stop_here every_time_i come thru town
i_went_to the royal india bistro for_the_lunch_buffet today
lunch was_very_good_and service_was_excellent
i was_the_first person here at_about
but several tables_were occupied before_i left
the_server asked_me for my_drink order
i_got tap water which
she then said they_had_a buffet_and_i replied that_was_the reason i_was_there
she gestured for_me_to go ahead_and start and she'd get_my naan
the_buffet_is small by comparison_to other_indian_buffets in_town
there_are hot dishes
some salad
and achaar
it_was_a_good enough choice and the_good taste_of_the_food made_up_for the limited selection
the_naan_was buttered generously and_was a_welcome addition_to_the meal
for my_first trip
i_got chicken_tikka_masala
malai_kofta
and_some basmati_rice
the_thing i_noticed about all_of their_dishes was they_all had_a_nice spicy flavor
it's_not overpowering for_people who like mild food_but it_had_a definite tang and_it_was not_just one_dish but_all of_them
it_was the_first_time_i know that_i_had malai_kofta_and it_was_really a_treat
the_last thing_was the vegetable_pakora
this was_a_bit disappointing
i_didn't read_the full description because i_know_what it_is
the_only vegetable i could_see taste_was potato
it_seemed more_like it_was_a pakora made_from bread stuffing and_some potato
for the_second plate
i_had aloo matar
daal maharani
and curry_chicken
the_aloo matar and curry_chicken were_good
the_daal was_ok
the_sign said spicy lentils but_this_was the_only dish_that_was lacking_in spice
there_were_some beans mixed in the_daal
too
for_dessert i got_some rice_pudding_and some carrot pudding
the_rice_pudding was_not labeled as kheer and_it had_a_lot_of liquid with less rice unlike kheer or rice puddings i've_had before
the_carrot pudding
on_the_other_hand
was_very thick_and unlike the_carrot puddings i've_had elsewhere
both puddings were_very_good i'm_not criticizing them but merely pointing out_the different preparation
i_wish_i_had seen the achaar at the_beginning of my_meal
i_didn't_think it_would_be as tasty with dessert
service_as i_said was_very_good
when_i_went for my_second plate
my dirty plate_was removed and my_water_glass refilled
the_server_was very_pleasant
the_room is quite_nice and_it_was_very quiet
the_price_is just over including tax
for_the limited selection
it's higher than most_places
also
you_have_to park and_walk your way through_the casino to_get there_and it's_right in_the_middle
halfway between either garage
still
i_won't hesitate_to stop_here and i_think_i'll try_it for_dinner some evening
ah mazing food
nice_and_spicy
by request
everything_was perfect food
service
spot_on
we_will_be_back
it's_worth a_trip over_to the_rio even_if you're staying somewhere_else
fabby was_fabulous great_service
our_waitress
jazmin
was_fabulous
she made_some great_suggestions after listening carefully to_us about_what we_liked
we_had_the fire naan
lamb_rogan_josh
and the_vegetable_korma
let's just_say that_we stuffed ourselves with fantastic tasting_food
if_you_are wondering where this_restaurant_is
you will_find it_in the_rio casino area
this_is_a_great little south_indian restaurant just two doors up_from wee boulangerie on clerk street
the nilgris and chettinadus
hot
are incredibly flavourful
the nans are not_like nan's i've seen anywhere else
much_more interesting
spinach dal is_great the_spinach is lightly cooked rather than being wilted to death as_in most_places
and the_dal a bright flavourful yellow
all_in all_the_food just comes across as fresh_and original
the_portions_are smaller than_in many_indian_restaurants
but so are the_prices
which_is_great
you_get_to try_more dishes without a_larger bill
two_of_us ate for
but most would_probably spend a_bit_more
it's_a_small place and_decor lighting simple
and the_staff_are really_friendly
it_only opened st march
and_has_a off discount all_this month
oh
and_no alcohol license yet
so byob which_is another advantage in_my_book
this_is
hands down
the_best south indian_food_i've_had_in edinburgh
since trying a_dosa last year
then exploring some_of_the hotter dishes from_the region
and choosing from_the overabundance of indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
when_i heard the_cholas had opened also offering dosas
i_made a booking as_soon_as_i could
and_what i_found wasn't just dosas
but lidls
and_lots_of other puffy bread products
and curries made_the proper way with chunks_of spinach_and simmered down lentils_and still firm chickpeas
and_each curry tasting entirely different_to the_last
even their drinks are homemade
the_cholas special
a tonic water_with lime and_mint concoction
incredibly refreshing
then_the lemon and ginger tea i_ordered at_the_end being another home_made beauty
the_chai latte is_also made in house
the_fact_that the_cholas make everything themselves
and_there isn't_a twinings teabag label in sight
really made_me happy
but the_biggest happiness came from the_food
so_many indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh
so_many doing nice food that_really is_tasty
but here you'll fine coconut rice_with mustard seeds
coconut flakes and almonds
or lemon_rice with kaffir leaves and_curry leaves and peanuts
or_a daal curry_with whole chickpeas
or_a chicken starter with_a delicious dopiaza style onion sauce
the_curries_were hardly 'saucy' at_all
as_is often the_case
big bowls_of creamy
liquid sauce_with chunks_of meat
oh no
these_were mainly the_ingredients whether it_was spinach_and lentils
or_chicken or chickpeas being_the centre of_the_dish
with hardly any extra
redundant
filler 'sauce'
i didn't_even try a_dosa and_i_was already head over heels
the_interior of_the_restaurant is_quite bare and_a_bit personality less
it_was_a night when_it_was blowing a blizzard of snow
and_it_was cold
no internal heating
although there_was_a small portable one
but the_staff_were so_friendly
and_the_food just divine
i_do hope_they go from strength to strength and word spreads
i'll be_back
and soon
for_the banana dosa dessert
and to_try_the
lunch deal
there's_also off in the_whole of march
after seeing jenny l's review
i_knew i_had_to come along
i_am_a massive fan of south_indian_cuisine
so edinburgh's dining scene is_very exciting for_me
we_came along
it_was empty
this_was probably because_it's new_and hasn't built up_a reputation yet
the_waiters were_really friendly_and the_menu_was very_authentic
on_offer are thalis
uttapams
idlis
dosas
various curries
and various other_dishes you_would find_in kerala or tamil nadu
my_boyfriend_and_i went_for_the classic masala_dosa
whereas our friend_who is visiting from milan opted_for_the chicken masala_dosa
dosas_are fantastic
as_the batter is_made of_rice_and lentil flour
meaning there_is no gluten inside
yay
unless_you choose the rava dosa_which is_made partly of cream of wheat
while_waiting for_our_food
the_waiter_brought a_plate_of poppadoms
mango_chutney
lime pickle and_a minty raita
these dips were slightly less authentic
but went down well
it_was especially nice as_it_was an unexpected treat
we also_got given a_glass_of a_sweet sparkling mint drink
which_was very refreshing
the food_arrived
and_it_was_very nice
the_dosa
whilst good
was_not the_best_i_have_had in_edinburgh
that_would_be tanjore or kalpna
but it_came close
improvements
they could_have supplied a_little_more sambar
made the_dosas more crispy
and the_masala filling could_have been much spicier
maybe aiming at british tastes
despite these little observations
it was_very_nice
and for_a new_restaurant they_did a great_job
i_think_that a_few simple adjustments could_be made_to make_this on_a par with the_best dosas in_town
on_the dessert menu
gulab_jamun
deep_fried sweet doughy things in_a_very sweet syrup
payasam
milky vermicelli pudding with cardamom
kulfi
the_most delicious pudding ever
a condensed milk ice_cream that comes_in either pistachio
badam
almond
or mango flavour
flavoured with_spices like cardamom
saffron
a_few standard ice_cream options
and_a regional dessert which_i don't remember_the_name_of which_is made of_rice_and black lentils
i_think it_was_a type_of halwa
i'd_love to_come_back to_try_the thalis
some_of_the_other typical dishes
and chat_with the_lovely staff
i_love supporting new south_indian restaurants
as so few people know what an_amazing cuisine it_is
there's more to_indian_food than curry
the_cholas has only been_open for_days or_so and last_night was_my second_visit
the_food_is is lovingly
beautifully prepared_and served
it's_all authentically southern_indian as my_friend who_has travelled there confirmed
without_a doubt the_best_indian_food_i_have experienced
as_a previous reviewer mentioned the_portions_are smaller than you_may find elsewhere and_also slightly cheaper so it_does mean you_can_try different_things
on both visits my_fellow diners and i_haven't bothered with a_starter course
instead we_ordered lots_of things to_come at the_same_time so_that we_can share and try_everything
there_were so_many interesting flavours to discover
they_have_some tasty teas and_drinks too
i_can't_remember the_indian names_of the_foods that_we_had last_night from the_top_of my_head
however we_did have_a seafood curry
a_vegetarian curry
a bread thing_that_was utterly delicious
coconut rice
which i_think_i could just eat on_its own
tamarind rice_and_a dosa
which_is_a kind of_indian crepe
the_decor_is quite basic
it_could put you_off at_first
but_i_can assure you without_a doubt that it_will no_longer matter when when_the_food arrives to_the_table the_world is_a brighter happier place
perfect_for these chilly times_in the burgh
i_think_the gracious and_friendly waiter adds much_to the_cholas
he_was exceptionally welcoming
but not_overly so at_all
i_could tell that if_we_had hadn't been so interested to_know about_the_food
south_india and the_new venture he would_have_been just_as kind and_efficient
he is_clearly just_as passionate about bringing this authentic cuisine to_edinburgh as the_chef
i_hope_they never compromise on the_quality_of their_food
i_hope it_never streams out_of_the kitchen at warp speed in_the form_of lumps of_meat floating in bland sauce
i_should also mention they_don't_have an alcohol licence however you_can bring_your_own alcohol
i've been twice now
but_would happily have anything i_have_tried so_far again
although there_is still so much_more on_the_menu i_would_like_to try
this_is_the longest review i_have_ever written
in_case it's_not obvious i_really hope these_guys do well
with so_much passion for_the_food they_make they absolutely deserve success
plus my standards for_good indian_cuisine has_been raised to a_level where if_they leave i_believe i_would_have to_go_to southern india to_experience it_again
off during march too
had an_amazing masala_dosa in_this small_restaurant
it is_clean_and elegant
the_staff_are generous_and polite
they've got a_good_selection_of food_and puddings in their_menu
and the_manager is_very keen on chatting and answering any question one might_have regarding the_food
the prices_are_very_reasonable and i_couldn't find any fault in_this experience
i_have_been times_in weeks
that's how_much i_really_like_the cholas
as_i said in_my previous review
it's hands_down_the best south indian_food_i've_had_in edinburgh
if you_think you_know 'indian food' this_is very_different to_the 'british indian' made_up of heavy naans
chicken_tikka massala and vindaloo
there_are sauce based curries
but_also lentil and_rice crepe like pancakes called dosas
delicious small_but buttery breads called paratha
desserts like paniyaram and gulab_jamun
and_of_course
mango_lassis
a thick
not_too_sweet mango milkshake
since_i've been so often
i_can now recommend my favourites
having tried many_things on_the_menu
vegetarian curry mains
brinjal curry
aubergine simmered in tomato
quite sweet but_also spicy
channa massala
chickpea_curry
so flavourful
dhal spinach
lentils simmered to_a sauce with_lots_of spinach
creamy
but without dairy
and_a_bit milder
meat curry mains
chicken chetinadu
mostly sauce based
no veggies in_the_sauce
but sweet_and spicy
it_is spiced with pepper not chilli
so isn't too_spicy
lamb nilgiri
green in colour
flavoured with_mint
but_not overpoweringly so
the_lamb is so_tender
meat mains
not curry
lamb masala_dosa
a_large
thin crepe made of_rice_and lentil flour
fried in ghee and stuffed_with lamb and_potatoes and_spices
it's gluten_free and_really filling
it_comes_with three types_of chutney
one being coconut
and a_small serving_of sambar
lentil curry_sauce
sides
paratha
non wheat bread
so gluten_free i_think
made_with corn
that_is round
flaky and absolutely_delicious dipped in anything
coconut rice
all_the rices come_with spices
nuts etc
in them
the_coconut rice is_by_far_the_best
no plain boiled rice here
desserts
gulab jalum
a very_sweet
sticky
not healthy small donut type ball deep_fried then soaked in sugar syrup
decadent
paniyaram
less sweet than galub jalum
a white small spongey ball with_some sultanas in_it
and_spices
a_bit lighter too
teas
lemon and ginger tea
even this_is home_made
no twinings tea bag here
i_know i'm_giving brief descriptions of_each
but basically everything_is home_made and_with the_best spices
every single curry_and dish i've_had here tastes entirely different
no generic
red
creamy sauces with chunks_of meat
instead
you'll find star anise mixed up amongst the_vegetables in_your kurma
and mustard seeds in_the rice
like_i said
even the_drinks are home_made
i'd also highly_recommend their special lime drink
very refreshing
and_you_can see_the put a_great amount of love into the_food
the_portions_are a_bit smaller but the_prices_are lower
which_you means you_can_order more things to_try and_still leave very full but without overspending
i_can_see myself returning here_many_times more
a_lot
they_know me by name now
and are_always very welcoming_and 'service with_a smile' is done so with the_most genuine of manners
i'm so_glad the_cholas opened
and long may it last
we_ate at this_new south_indian place based on other reviews_on_yelp
and_then ate_there again because_it_was so_delicious
we_don't get_a_lot of_south indian_cooking in new england so_we just asked our_server to_bring us_a good_meal
half vegetarian half not
everything_was fantastic
and_he_was great about encouraging us to_eat things we'd never_had before
giving us_the choice_of having it
british hot
or
indian hot
if_you_go
order_a double order_of the_chili fried idli
you_won't_be sorry
limited beer_and_wine menu
but the_cholas special mint drink was_a_great alternative
i_had_heard amazing things_about the_cholas and_when myself_and a_friend were_looking_for somewhere to_go we passed this_place and_i_thought why_not
it_was empty apart from_one other_table
the_waiter was_very_friendly_and polite but_was hard_to hear as_he talked quite low
i_went_for_the chicken masala_dosa as i_wanted_to_try something different_and had_heard so_much about dosas
although the_place_was empty it_seemed to_take a_long_time for_the_food_to come_out which_i didn't necessarily mind but my_friend_had to catch the_last bus home
i_also found_it a_bit cold in_the_restaurant
while_we_were waiting we_were given free poppadoms_and then onion_bhaji which_was unexpected and very_nice
the_dosa_was great and_i'm glad i_tried_it out
i_had_a chai_tea at_the_end which wasn't_very flavoursome
i_like mine to_have a_bit_more punch to_it
i_was_a_little disappointed_by_the overall experience when i_had_heard so_much good_things about_this_place so i'll definitely_have to_go_back again_to hopefully change my_opinion
the_food_was_really excellent
it's_nice to_try_some of_the_more unknown indian_options
but something_for everyone if you prefer_the more tried and tested tikka_masala
the_staff_were_very nice_and explained everything we_were_eating and answered all_our questions without being too in your_face
perhaps_the list_of starters was_a_bit too_long as_it_was hard to_choose_from so many_options
i'll be_back_again as there's loads i_want_to try
this_is_the_best_indian_food i_have_had anywhere
and from any region of_india
bar none
the_food_is_fresh
delicious and_full_of great flavours_and colours
everything_is prepared fresh to_order
the_menu selection_is very varied with_lots_of great choices
the_staff_are wonderful
very_friendly
courteous_and eager_to create a_great dining_experience for_you
the_restaurant_itself_is nicely designed and set
and is_very_clean
have_been_there twice already in_a month's time
they_have_a_great lunch_and_dinner menu
offer free delivery and catering
also
you_will_not_be_disappointed
and will_visit often
i_expect
enjoy
popped in on_the strength of_the reviews_here and had_been trying_to get_here for some_time
but due_to one_thing or another we_never quite made_it
by_the_time_we all had_a free evening to_check_it_out we_were really looking_forward_to the_meal
positive side first_i went mainly for the_dosa as_for whatever reason there doesnt seem_to be many_places to_grab a_dosa in_edinburgh and_i wasnt disappointed
i_opted_for_the masala_dosa which_was just_as i_remember
standard set of condiments and_nicely spiced
a_nice_touch was the_waiter informed us_that they_would refill the_dips free of change as_much as we_needed
before_the food_we were_given poppadoms_and dips
the_dips were_great in particularly the_mixed pickle
unfortunately the_other side_of_the experience was_that_the curries we_ordered really werent good
they_were a veg chettinadu
chicken chettinadu and_a veg biryani
all of_them were riddled full_of the cooking spices_that are normally removed before serving
every mouth seemed_to present some_sort_of raw spice from a_full star anise to_a the bark stuff i_cannot remember_the_name_of
this_really wasnt pleasant
by the_end_of_the_meal we_had excavated piles of inedible nonsense from our_food
the_curries them selves were_okay i_tried a_bit_of the chettinadu and_all i_could taste_was cinamon and star anise with_a_bit of_heat on_the back end
mmm
i_would_go_back for the_dosa i_guess
but_that_was it_really
the_service_was_good
the_food as a_whole wasnt and_the stars are for the_service_and the_dosa alone eveything else was_a thumbs down from_me
i_had been_wanting_to try the_cholas for_a_while based on several recommendations over yelp
and last friday_evening i managed_to get_there along_with other well tuned curry fans
entering the_restaurant
we_were faced with fairly standard decor
woodchip walls
simple lighting and for_some_reason
adhesive gift bows stuck to the_walls
we_were sat at_a table_for four
which because_it_was an extendable table meant that_i rather uncomfortably sat with_my leg curled around the_table leg for_the duration
the_menu offers_a nice variety_of different_dishes
and typical of_indian_cuisine
veggies are_very well catered for
between the_of_us
we_ordered_a veggie_and a_chicken chettinadu
a_veggie biryani
all_of which_had the_same sauce
and a_dosa though sadly just one_of these_dishes lived up_to any sort of expectation
the_biggest problem_with the_cholas is_that_they fail to remove any_of_the inedible pods and leaves before serving
this_is either because_they_are rushing to_get_the food_out to_the punters
or this_is_a conscious decision to_make_the sauces differ from_a jar sharwoods sauce
this might be harsh
but_the chettinadu sauce_was identical to_a pre made vindaloo sauce
in either case
the_last thing you_want when dining in_a_restaurant is to_be gouging pieces_of bark out_of your_mouth
by the_end_of_the_meal we each had piles of bits and pieces sitting on_our side plates
perhaps a spittoon would_have_been a_more appropriate piece_of crockery to_have on_the_table
negativity aside
the_dosa_was apparently
great
and_the service_was_very_friendly
the accompaniments to_the poppadoms_and the naan_breads were above_average and_their lime pickle was darned tasty
i'm glad i_went_to try the_cholas for_myself
and_i'm hoping they_were just having an_off night on_friday
but_i_don't_think i_will_be heading back_there any_time soon
the_cholas really sums up why i_love yelp
it's the_kind_of place you spend years looking_for
but probably wouldn't give a_second thought to if you_just walked past it_on_the street
step inside_and it_doesn't look a_whole lot_more promising a_small
narrow restaurant
with beige walls_and splashes of dark wood straight out_of_the ' s
it's_really at_this_point
however
that_the evidence of_your eyes becomes much less important than_that of_your nose
aromatic south_indian spices
bubbling ghee
grilling meat_and bread all jostle for_your attention
if that's_not enough_to convince you_to grab_a seat
and_if it's_not
i_really don't think we'll get on
the_friendly
welcoming staff certainly will_be
so
to_the_food
it's basically everything i've been_looking_for in_an_indian_restaurant since_i moved_to edinburgh interesting
authentic dishes_with varied
distinctive flavours_and textures
properly seasoned_and sensible portion_sizes
it's such_a novelty to_have dishes_that aren't drowning in fatty unctuous sauces
generic spice blends and_two dimensional chilli heat
the meat_options are_great
but_it_was really the_vegetable dishes_that stood out for_me
don't think i've ever_had such_an exceptional brinjal curry anywhere the_aubergine actually tastes of aubergine
and_is balanced perfectly by_the delicate smokiness of_the fresh curry leaves in_the thick
sticky sauce
the dals are_also brilliant
perfectly seasoned_and spiced
with real texture_and an earthy lentil flavour that_really complements the_other_dishes
this_is_definitely my_new favourite indian_restaurant in_edinburgh
it more_than stands up_to mother_india cafe my current spicy hangout of_choice and_even some_of glasgow's best
so
yeah
recommended
the_cholas
on south clerk street
is_a_place which_has built up_a devoted following in_the few_months since_it opened_and hosted the_yelp team recently when_i_was away
the cholas' menu of south_indian_dishes is extraordinary in_its diversity
encompassing a_huge range_of cooking styles
ingredients_and flavours
we enlisted the help of our_waiter
to ensure that across our_party we_got_a good variety_of_dishes to_try
we_decided_to_try the_new paneer dhosa that_isn't on_the_menu
it's_a thin rice_and lentil flour pancake with paneer cheese and fried onions that was_very_tasty
especially_with the cocnut dip
chutneys and_sauces
mh opted_for_the king prawns
then the_lamb nilgiri
i_ordered_the chilli idli
then the_fish_curry
the_service_was really_friendly and_the_waiter very patiently explained what dishes would compliment our choices
m's king prawns were_good_and the idli was_a spicy_but really_tasty but the_fish_curry wasn't_as flavourful as i_would_have hoped
the_lamb however was_lovely
so overall
the_cholas was_a_very interesting experience
as_the range_of dishes on_offer was impressive though i_think_we need_to_go again to_try_more things
especially as the_restaurant_is such_a new enterprise i_think_the food will only get better
cholas serves amazing south_indian_food
i'm_not usually into indian_food
but_i_was curious to_try_out this fairly new_place after_reading all_the rave reviews
well
i_wasn't disappointed at_all
for_starters i_shared a_dosa which_came_with three different chutneys
coconut
mint_and tomato
the_dosa_was light
crisp_and airy perfect
for main_dish i_chose the_lamb nilgiri with coconut rice
the flavours of this_dish were_just amazing
i_cannot fault it it any way the_only minor issue is_that_the lamb could_have perhaps been a_bit softer
but nevertheless i_enjoyed it_very_much
i've got_a mission now
i_will have to_come_back_and work my_way through the_menu it's_just too delicious not_to
i_need_to explain i_was invited to_go_here as_a birthday present
the duchess of the_cholas tanja r was_very convincing that_i
as non enthousiast of_indian_food
would find_this_place as wonderful as_she does
especially the_dosas
anita a
called ahead to advise we_were bringing our own dessert which_was no problem
star
so in a_group_of we_arrived_at around
you_see where this_is going as_i mention an arrival time
we_were_seated and i_took_a good look around the_place
an elongated place_with dark wooden tables on either side and_a dispensing bar order section in_the_back on_the_way to the_kitchen
i_was_hoping to elaborate on_the atmosphere
but_there_was none
no decoration of note ok i lied
they_used those shiny metallic wrapping stars you use on presents
on_the_wall
about of_them evenly spaced over the_place
the_table decoration was nicely done_with the_actual only bright colour in_the_place
tanja r was warmly greeted_by_the owner manager and_was assured tonight was_going_to_be a blast
that_was_a serious overstatement
i_will_not go_in to_many details but_i mentioned the time_of arrival and after_ordering
he_made a_really clear show of repeating every ordered dish back to_us
and awaiting our starters
we eventually got_our starters at
wtaf
we became a_bit worried about_what and why it_took so_long
as they_kept forgetting water we_asked_for twice
and_my beer had_to_be reordered too
evident ally they_were_busy
however a_table of_that arrived about_half hour after us got starters at the_same_time as us
i_was again assured by menno v
tanja r
and anita a
that_they_had just recently opened and_this_is just unusual however that statement was_on shaky ground
when_the main_courses arrived
fairly swift after_the starters
they managed_to not serve mine
i_got_the rice
but_no main
i_shared_the meal of others
we_did ask where my_meal was_an he said_he was_going_to check_and reorder
however we_were thus far that_all of_the_other diners already finished and_my rice was_also about gone we cancelled my_main meal
my birthday meal
not_impressed
i_had_to eat from_other plates to_have_a meal on_my birthday
seriously
fair does to_the taste though as all_the_food we_did have was_very flavourful
star
but_it would_have_been nice_to actually have my_own meal
the tiramisu that anita made was_very_nice
little in apologies was supplied and they_actually put_the missing dish on the_bill
at_this_point i_started doubting the_previous rating for cholas of my_fellow diners who even at_this_point still half heartily defended the_place
another disappointment was_the toilet
beside not_being very_clean
i_was just washing my hands and hand dryer didn't work
yes menno v
i_did try_to use_the on switch
no paper towels
so_i resorted to toilet paper
and_the holder fell off the_wall and onto the_floor
i_tried placing it_back
didn't fit
afterwards when going again it_was back_in place_and at the_first tuck it fell off again
so they_kept telling that_this_place just_opened and_they_are usually not busy
well when star reviews are set you better get used_to being busy
and_now with_the fringe in_town people will look_for good places to_eat_and look_at that_all important star_rating
even tanja r anita a had_to advise the_owner manager that_they will_have_to avoid going_here during_the fringe as they_are_not looking_to repeat this experience
if they_don't get_their act together
my_review may_not be the_only_one of_its kind
but many more will follow
i_was_so disappointed_that due_to all_this waiting to_get food the_whole evening was_about over when_we finished_eating and_we_were too tired
too full
and miffed
to_do anything else well i_did anyway
so home wards it_was
it should've been so_nice and_i_was pleased_to have_my good friends with_me
but any_other place would've likely been a_better experience
when_you regularly see smiling indian faces as regulars the_food has_to_be up_to mums standard
also they support marie curie cancer care a worthy cause on presentation of_a voucher
i magine when its busy you have_to_wait longer to be_served
however be patient its good_food_and good_value
try_and taste the_difference
oh how_the mighty can fall
the_cholas was_the newest opening in_edinburgh i_was most excited_about
it opened in march and_i_went about times_in weeks
as my_first review_of it attests
i_got chatting to the_waiter
and learned that the_chef was from south_india and had_been a_south_indian chef for a_number_of years
the_food that_was presented over the_last months at the_cholas was beautiful
chana_masala chocked full_of chickpeas
chicken_curries so delicately and intricately spiced
paratha bread_that was melt in_the mouth delicious
dosas that_were crispy
and filled_with flavouful potato or lamb
but in_the_last months
the_food_quality has reduced quite a_lot
and_in such ways that i_can point_out what has changed
the_chana_masala has about has many chickpeas as it_used_to
and_is far more a 'sauce' with_some floating chickpeas in_it
before it used_to_be made_up of almost purely stewed
soft chickpeas
the_dosa once came
home delivery
with_a lamb filling that had_no flavour or spice
they must_have forgotten to_add any spices
but_it_was tasteless
the chicken_curries taste_like standard
uk indian
creamy
spicy curries but with_no distinct flavour
the paratha is thicker
heavier
less buttery and_fresh
and_just not_as great
the_aubergine curry also_has less aubergine in_it
this used_to_be_a restaurant_that offered what many indian_restaurants_in_edinburgh couldn't
excellent_indian_food
authentically cooked and_spiced
with beautiful ingredients
good portion_sizes with_very unique dishes
the waiting time_in the_restaurant_was lengthy
and the_interior of_the_restaurant is_also_very 'lacking' and_plain
but it_was_worth_it for_the delicious_food
now
the_restaurant_is still lacking_in decor
the waiting time is_still very_long
and the_food_quality has reduced so_much_that i_don't_want_to spend minutes waiting_for it and_really don't_know_if i'll go_back
i've ordered
both sit_in and takeaway
times from_them since_i noticed the_change in_quality
each time hoping the_last was_a fluke
but_no
it_seems_to be permanent
this_is almost_like a break up
i'm sorry cholas
you still serve totally 'a ok' south_indian_food
but_it certainly isn't any different or special to anything else served in_edinburgh
and_you used_to have something_that no_one could imitate
such a_shame
the_dosa may be_great
however the_curries just lack due care and attention
a_little cinnamon bark
cardamon pod or star anise might be ok
but_not mounds of_the stuff
while necessary for flavouring the_food
for the_most_part this should be removed
the_curry also had_an odd sweetness to_it
despite being_a supposedly hot dish
some_of_the heat was_there but_i_was just_to distracted removing the inedible
the_chicken_was only ok
certainly not_the_best meat i_have_had_in a_curry either
all in_all i_can't recommend cholas
particularly when there_are_plenty_of other better curry choices in_the_area
i have_known them from_their incubation days
humble start up
nice people_and they_make great_food
i_ordered biryani twice from_them
one for a_big birthday party
and_it_tasted so authentic both of_the times
not_so pricey and_this could_be very_well one_of_the best biryanis in_the_valley
just make_sure_to mention about_the spicy hotness level in_the_food when_you_order
wonderful_and yummy biryani
we_have_had food catered from_this group several_times
recently we_ordered veg_and chicken_biryani
both were_delicious
i placed an_order days in_advance for_my boyfriends birthday party by calling their number
the_guy on_the_phone was_not prepared_to take_my order_and instead_of taking my_order and information
the he asks me_to send them my_order via e mail
without much direction
i send an e mail with my_order
i_didn't check my e mail within_a day_and my_order was cancelled
regardless of the_fact
that i_called them immediately the_following morning at
am and repeatedly calling and emailing again hoping to_get_my order through
the_guy finally calls by back_at
informing me that_he could_not fulfill my_order and that_he had_been away from his business phone and he_had clearly lost number from before so_he could_not call me
needless
to_say_i had_no food_for my_party
so_after a_couple weeks of_me wanting a combination_of wanting spice_and buttery and salty things
all thanks_to me being pregnant
my_hubby finally won in_his mission to_get me_to_try indian_cuisine
seriously
it_was_more of an_off handed suggestion that_we trade in_my chinese request for_indian and_my spice craving offspring overtook my brain and_the voice that yelped
yes
sounded like something out_of_the exorcist
a_short time later we_found ourselves at bombay palace
a brand new_indian_restaurant my darling hubby had spied being built during_our many trips_to big lots
my obsession
it took_us quite awhile to_be_seated
another customer picking_up catering goods actually flagged down the_hostess who in turn seated_us
they_also obviously don't use their ac
which_made life kind of interesting_and had_me rolling up_my pant legs under the_table a culinary experience first for_me
my_friend
who_was joining us
and_i inquired about foods that wouldn't burn our virgin
to_indian
mouths off and the_hostess waitress quickly sent the_chef out who's a_rather charming east indian man
he guided us straight and true and suggested i_order the_chicken_korma curry_in mild
mild did_not mean watered_down and americanizes
it meant not fire in your_face
but enough_of a_kick to_keep life interesting
oh
my
god
seriously
oh
my
god
i_was born in the_wrong neck of_the woods
indian_food is_my_new calling in life and i_will_never ever not trust my husband's culinary decisions ever again
this_restaurant_is incredible and i_hope it stays forever
everyone needs to_try bombay palace and_share it_with everyone they care_about because sharing is caring and this_food totally equals love
i_would so give_it stars_if it_wasn't for_the slow start and lack_of ac
seriously
i'm in_love
the_food_was_great
nice
little clean_place
the_menu lacks description
but i_was_able_to ask the_waiter about anything_that sounded interesting
i_will_be_back
amazing
spicy
if_you_want
authentic_indian_food
take the_lack_of descriptions in_the_menu as_a sign_of the restaurant's authenticity and_your opportunity_to learn what some dishes_are without_a cheat sheet
the_server will describe what things are if_you_have questions or
if_you_are ordering takeout
you_can gfg it
this_is no_longer southern spice
and_the mediocrity of that_other restaurant_is no_longer there
either
we've ordered takeout several_times through grubhub and_loved_it
they honor requests of spiciness and make_it just_right
kormas
vindaloo
biryani
paneer or chicken_tika_masala
basmati_rice_and samosas have_all been piping_hot
fresh
served_with love and absolutely_delicious
go go go
forget any_other restaurant that_has ever_been in_that location
amazing_food
they customize the_spice_level to_your liking
tried hyderabadi chicken dum_biryani and_chicken chettinad
by_far_the_best_indian food i've_eaten in_tempe
meh
service_is attentive_and eager but_not_too competent
e
g
we_ordered cabernet and_got tepid chardonnay
food_was_so so
not_as_good_as delhi palace
the_spinach part_of_the palak_paneer was reminiscent_of school lunch spinach
maybe canned
the_amount_of sauce in_the lamb_and_chicken dishes_was disproportionate to the_meat there_were only_a_few bites of_meat to a_good
cups of_sauce
none_of_the three curries or_the birjani was memorable
went to_check_out_the lunch_buffet
appears to_be out_of business
no hours posted on_the sign outside
best
well shit
all_good things must come_to an end and i_suppose favorite indian_restaurants_are no_exception
maharana
isnt entirely bad
good_service
clean space food entirely worth stars
but absolutely make no mistake
this_place_is not_as_good_as the_place that_was here
that rhymes with maharana
its very obvious they_are cutting corners on ingredients where previous restaurant may_not have
oddly enough we_really noticed in the_desserts
rice_pudding a_little to cloyingly sweet
gulab oddly metallic flavored
what_was offered on the_rest_of_the buffet was_good
but again just a_little_less richly flavored than our_party had_been accustomed_to
i_hate to_say_it
but we_will_be moving on from_our regular stop_here
i hear there_are_a fair amount of_indian_restaurants in_madison
i
this_place_was really just_okay
service_was okay
could have_been_better but_it_was decent
i_was rather disappointed_with_the naan
it_was super salty_and i_was_pretty close_to sending it_back but_i preserved and finished it
my eggplant_dish was_good
and_there_was plenty of_rice to_go around
they deliver around madison
which_is_a plus
i_drove to inchins on_their very first day_and without_a doubt it_was_very crowded
i_had_to leave the_place without any dinner because i_have_a month old son and_he would_not allow me to_wait for_a_long_time
no complains there
i came_back on_the upcoming wednesday and_the_place had mild traffic
the_service_was terrific and we_were_served our_food quickly
service_was_very_good and_i commend the_place_for that
not_too sure_how efficiently they_would function in extremely high traffic
moving on to_the_food
not_too spicy_as you get_it in_india
but i_dont mind that part
generous portion_sizes
good menu choices
vegetarian_and non_vegetarian
prices
not on_the modest side
for a_starter is a_little_bit high for_me
additional sauces on_the side are a_big plus and improve the taste_of_the_food
overall
i_would_recommend_this_place to_anyone_who would_like to_try_out something new for a_change
but_if_you expect spicy indianized chinese
this_is_not for_you
edit
visited_this location again
the_staff_was pleasant as_usual
but_the_food_is downright boring
the chineese bhel was_probably fried in used oil and_the_chicken manchurian lacked any flavor
not_going back_to_this_place
boring
yawn
excellent_food
we_had_been eagerly looking_forward_to its opening as_we love_their atlanta branch
food was_spicy_and very_close_to the_indian_food we_get back_home
the_kids loved the_gobi_manchurian appetizer
the_chili_chicken was_fabulous and so_was_the burnt garlic fried_rice
the_hot and_sour soup_was meh
the quantities were_perfect
so_happy to_have an indian_chinese place in_scottsdale
so here's the deal_with inchin bamboo garden the_service on_weekends is meh
partly because_of_the indian mentality of not turning a guest
in_this case a customer
away
american restaurants are_very upfront about waiting time_and solid about reservations
but inchin on_weekends
not_so_much
i'm_not sure_if it_is because_they_are brand new_and trying_to build a customer base or_if it's_a management problem
either way
they_should fix it soon because their_food
omg
i_think_the indo_chinese_food at inchin might even be better_than some that i_have_had_in india
it_was_so_good that_we didn't_even mind the can_be better service
it_was_worth every minute of_our wait
we_got veg manchurian
chili_chicken
hakka noodles and burnt garlic fried_rice
and_loved_it
in_fact
we_went this past friday and_i'm already craving their_food
we might go_back this weekend
the_place_is worth checking_out
if_you_are_not up_for a_wait on_a weekend
go on_a_weekday
but do go
also
do let them know_about the spice_levels
just in_case
our_food_was spicy but_we_were okay with_that
why
why
why do_i always_have
bizarre o
experiences at restaurants
i_am beginning to_think i_am cursed
is_it so hard that_i receive a balance_of good customer_service
good_food_and a nice_atmosphere
is_it too_much to_ask
really
read my other_reviews and_you_will understand what_i_am talking about
dismal one and_two star ratings
of otherwise highly rated restaurants
well
on to_this story
i_normally try_to not frequent
chain
or
franchised
restaurants
i_don't_like them
when_i_go out_and spend money
i_want a chef preparing my_food
not_a cook
if_i want_a cook to prepare my_food
i_will cook_it myself at_home
i_am_a cook
not_a chef
i_visited inchin bamboo garden on with_a_group_of co_workers celebrating a birthday lunch
the birthday person chose the_place
it_was noon and_the_place_was completely empty when_our party_of arrived
we chatted a_bit and_then placed our_order
we_all ordered_off the lunch_menu which_included soup
a_choice_of rice_and_the entr_e
one_of_my co_workers was worried about_the spice_level_of the black bean sauce in one_of_the vegetarian_dishes_and asked if she_could have_the sauce_on the_side
about min after_we had_all placed our_order
the_waitress came_back and_said she_could not_get the_sauce on_the side
hmmmm
why
it_was_just sauce
so we_asked to_speak to the_manager as we_felt this_was not_an unreasonable request
the_manager
begrudgingly
came_over_and said_they could_not serve her black bean sauce_on the_side because_they_are a franchise restaurant_and they_use prepared powdered mixes and_it reconstitutes as they_cook the_dish
oh_yeah
that sounds yummy
not
oh
btw that_was the_last_time we_saw the_manager
about_minutes into_our wait
still no soup
nothing
then some entr es start coming out
i_got mine
and_i said to the_waitress
shouldn't the_soup come first
she said
yeah
usually
usually
ok
whatever
out_of_the of_us
got entrees_and soup
the_other had nothing not_even the_soup
one_of_my co_workers ordered the_chicken_curry_and her teeny
tiny bowl was_only a_tad over half_full
i_will attach a picture
yes it_was_so pathetic i_took_a picture
the picture time stamp was
pm make note of_this
my portion_was small
but_at least i_got my full portion
i_ordered_the sliced lamb hot garlic
it_was_ok
the_rice_was terrible
i_ordered_the fried_rice
it_was dry
cold_and flavorless
it_was_like it_had_been made_the day before_and thrown onto my_plate
the_hot and_sour soup was_cold on top and smoking hot in_the_middle
it_was_not very_good either
i_wanted_to eat
i_was hungry
but_as my_other co_workers sat soupless and foodless i held off
so we_waited
and_waited and_waited about another_minutes
finally the_waitress brought of soups but_still no entrees
one
lone
co_worker still sat with nothing
we_all had meetings and_had_to get_back so we_had_no choice but_to ignore etiquette and start eating
then magically
one_more lunch was_served from_the_kitchen which ended up not_being what she ordered
but_she accepted it anyway
and_then there were_three
one co_worker still with_no soup or entr_e
we_asked the_waitress what_the heck was going_on
the_waitress then told_us that_all our_food_was ready at the_same_time
but of the_entrees_were delivered to other_tables
what other_tables
there_wasn't anyone else there when_we_ordered
there_was now one other_table of_people
but did they_really have our_food
what_was the coincidence of_them ordering the_same items
finally
at
pm
the_last entrees came out from_the_kitchen sadly one had_to_be in_a
to_go
bag because she_had no_time to_eat because_of her meeting and_had_to get_back to_work
the_other two co_workers just ate fast
at_the_end_of this horrible experience
they_did comp the missing meals and_after asking they_took off my_bill geez thanks
the_waitress made mention_that the_manager sent her out_to us_to apologize and to_let us_know that servers quit that morning and_they_had to_use kitchen staff to_help run the_food
well there were_only tables of_people total
how_many servers do you_need_to wait on tables
there_were other_people i_saw working_there doing nothing
and_what about the_manager
where_the heck was he
why wasn't he helping
never once did he come over_to apologize
but instead sent the_waitress out_to do_that for_him
isn't_that his job
all he_did was hide in_the_kitchen
truly terrible experience
ironically
the_girl who_had to_get_the
to_go
order_and never_got any soup
is_from seattle and_she says that_she used_to frequent the franchise located there_and said_that it_was_wonderful
hard_to believe_that is_true with_the comedy of errors at_this_place
this_is_a do_not return dnr
food_is_really_good
but the_service_is aweful
i_don't understand what part_of restaurant service they_don't get
they have_such good_food_and i_hope_they don't screw up_with the_service_and drive away the_customers forever
i_may be_one ov those if_they continue with_this type_of ridiculous service
it_is_a truth universally acknowledged
that any foodie from_india must_be in want of_good indo_chinese_food
and_oh i_have waited_for that in_phoenix for the_last years i_have_been_here
i_have finally been rewarded
we_had_a good dining_experience last friday when we_went_for_dinner
the_sweet corn chicken soup
drums of heaven and salt and pepper shrimp were_all quite comparable to what_you_get back_home
for_entrees
we_had_the_chicken manchurian
chilli_chicken and chilli shrimp
unfortunately
all_of_the gravy
while tasty
tasted alike
would_have probably given_a
star due_to this but am feeling generous
the burnt garlic fried_rice and hakka noodles was_very_good
they_also have_their sauces on_the_table so_you_can customize as you_want
serving size is_decent
service_and decor_is_very nice
tip
please make_reservations prior_to going_here
they either overbook on_the reservations or are_really busy
we_walked_in without a_reservation and had_to_wait almost minutes to_be_seated
will_return whenever the craving hits again
did_not even_get to a_table
despite having called an_hour before_and asked_for_a table_for at
the female on_the_phone told_me that they_were_not taking any more reservations but for_us_to come_on in_and they_would seat us
upon arrival there_was no greeting from any_of_the staff
i_walked up_to_the person_who seemed in charge and_had_to get his attention as_he was_more involved with another
yawning
employee
i_won't go into any further details but_i see_the common thread about poor_service in_all_the reviews
i concur
i_think this_is_one and_only indo_chinese restaurant_in phoenix_area
nice_and clean_place
food_was_really_good
we_went_on_a thu with reservation and_was_not crowded
try_the manchurian chicken
tasty
indo_chinese cuisine_is pretty popular in_india especially in_the south_india
i've been wondering why there_are_so few of_them here in_the_us when the_indian diaspora is increasingly south_india
if_you_are expecting the american chinese or real chinese cusine
you_will_be very_disappointed
but_if you_know_what indo_chinese tastes_like
this place_is_pretty close_to what it_should_be
went_here with_a_big group_and tried almost_everything on_the_menu
loved_their appetizers
and all_their fired rices tasted similar
their spice_level is_pretty mild_and the_sauces that they_put on_the_table are very_tasty
i_am sure it's_not_the food you_should be_eating all_the_time being deep_fried and_all but it's_a_great guilty pleasure if done once in_a_while
the_service_was_good albeit a_little_slow
the_restaurant get packed so
having a_reservation definitely helps
uh oh
now bear with_me for a_second
i_went_in for_lunch a_few_weeks_ago and stood at_the_front for_about minutes_before finally leaving
ok
it_was probably
but when_you're waiting it seems_like twice the_time
and either way was too_long
strike one
the_place still has intrigued me so_i decided_to_give_it_a second chance
if only for_some take_out
so_i walk_in around_pm
and grab_a menu from the_bartender
i decide to_order_the friend won ton and_the
well
i asked_her about_the singapore shrimp
she_had absolutely no_idea what_it_was
i_then asked_her about_the won tons
and_she did ask me if_i wanted vegetarian or_chicken
so she knew_the won ton
while she was_very_nice
not knowing a product on_a menu isn't really acceptable in_a_restaurant like_this
she fumbled around for_a_while until she_could get someone to_explain it
so at least she_was trying
not her fault but is_very indicative of the_management
that needs to_be fixed
strike two
anyway
i_got_the food home
and whoa
reversal
the wontons were_perfect
chicken
and not_what you'd_expect
very_tasty_and almost light they were_excellent
and then_i got_to the_shrimp
and_it_was also really_good
it_wasn't as spicy_as i_wanted
but_it_was plenty spicy_enough i_just like xxxxx hot
the_texture was_great
the_shrimp were large_and all in_all it_was enough_food
i_will_go_back
but if_they continue_to have service issues they_will fail
i
my_husband_and_i went_for_dinner at inchin last evening
we_arrived_at pm_and the_place_was_packed
we_were_seated at_the_bar until we_got_our table
we had_a_few daiquiris and margaritas nothing_special there
for appetizer we_had_the fried_chicken wantons
they_were deep_fried
as hard as rocks
i_could taste nothing
we_also_tried the_mixed fried_rice
and scjezuan chicken
the_rice_was not_too bad
it_was un oily
which_i appreciated
the_chicken was_good_too
reminded me_of_the chinese fare i_am_used_to from eastern india
all in_all
the food_was_ok
the_place_is a_little un managed though
there_were folks who_were party_of
seated at a_person table
thereby wasting two seats
those could_have been pulled out to_make_a makeshift table
which would_have reduced the_wait times
ambience was_great but food_was_very mediocre
the noodles tasted_good
i_didn't_like the manchurian
food_was_very spicy
great_food as_always in_every inchins location same spicy level and good_amount for_lunch serving
had crispy chili honey chicken_with hot and_sour soup and_chicken fried_rice taste will_be mouth till dinner
i_will_never go_back
i_said i_would_give it another_chance
which_i shouldn't have
after my_last review and_i did that
more_of the_same
terrible_service
took minutes_to even be greeted to_get_my take_out
then the_person behind_the bar said and_i quote
yeah
it_will likely be minutes_before we_can even start your_order
this_is too_bad
but three strikes and you're out
yummy spicy_food reminds of chinese_food in_india
really good_food_and ambiance
service ok_but can_be better
great chinese_food in indian_style
i and my_friends were dying to_eat indo_chinese_food from a_long_time and_we_are glad_to find_this_place
chicken schezwan and american chopseuy were_amazing
would_recommend to_all indians
really_need stars here
more_like
this_is_not_a chicago restaurant but_for dumbed down scottsdale it is_decent
at least there_are_some interesting choices and_the_food_is pretty_tasty
a_bit heavy handed on_the salt or soy i_think
but some_good flavors
i_chose the hottest dished available
and_they_were still_not very_hot for_me
but_i could add some_of_the table sauces_and that_did it
my hsb likes blander dishes like_the stir fried beef
the_chicken_and beef were good_quality
not grisly like_some places
our service_was fine
we_had_a really pretty indian american girl who was_on_the ball
the_place_was full saturday when we_came_in at
then really got busier
most_of_the patrons were ethnic which isalways a_good_sign
but most appeared_to be of_indian heritageor that neighborhood
not asian
anyhow
we'll try_it_again
there_is really slim pickings wth this type_of food_here
i_have written this before
but_will write it_again that
in_phoenix
an_indian_restaurant would_not suffer on bad_service
an_indian_restaurant will probably suffer on bad_food only
i_mean all indians loves_the indo_chinese_food
it_is greasy
it_is fried but_still we_love it
inchin has_a_great variety for_vegetarians
no problems with food at_all
it_is yummy
the soups and appetizers are_great
the entrees_are great_too
i_mean nobody else_is serving this stuff
so of_course inchin has_an edge over other_indian_restaurants
the_portions_are big
so_you would_definitely pack some home_for next day
we_have been_here_times
one_of which_was the_new year's eve
too_many server girls moving around
we_were taken to_our seat as we_had_a reservation
the_restaurant_was not completely packed as yet
but_this lady never returned to us_with menus
the girls were_just moving around in groups
just chatting away
not looking or going_to customer's seats at_all to ask_them
whatever
i_did_not see any manager who would at least just tell them what_was needed to_be done
anyways we_got_our menus and_ordered
the_food took_forever_to come
overall service_is not_that_great
but_not absolutely pathetic
so_i go_for stars
five_stars coz there_isn't anything higher than_that
excellent_food
very professional service_and perfect ambience
best place_for_indian chinese_food hands down
we drive all_the_way from gilbert for_this food
great_job
love_their veg coin manchurian and lat mai paneer
the soups and sauces_are full_of cornstarch and_have_a gooey consistency
would we ever go_back
no
giving two_stars only_because the_food_was_good
not_great
but_good
pros
good_food
cons
horrible service
late food
took almost an hr to_get_the food
servers_are not_even bothered to_ask once they_take the orders
our_server took wrong order and_then had_to replace the_food
server didn't_even know_how_to place the_food_on_the table
slams the_plates all_the_time
chewing gums
no etiquette at_all
is_it worth_a second_visit
only when_i'm craving_for a indo_chinese_food
so freaking excited that we_finally have an_indian chineese fusion place around here
my_wife_and_i love indo chineese
it's one_of_the fusions we look_forward_to on_all our trips_to india
with these two countries neighboring each_other it's_not surprising the_flavors_are compatible and_can cross pollinate so_well
the_only real question is_why hasn't it picked up more in_the_us
that_said
inchin bamboo garden is_a breath of_fresh air in_the relatively mediocre indian_food options we_have in_the_phoenix_area
hallelujah
that_said
they're not_quite into_our regular rotation for_a_few key reasons
the_service needs some work
too often we_found ourselves waiting_for soda water refills
etc
this might be because the_location was relatively new when_we_went there
so_i'm willing to_not slam them on_this as_much_as_i would a_more established place
pick_it up guys
some_of_the dishes seemed_to err just a_bit_on salt msg side common in_some cheaper chineese restaurants
again
they_were new and_were probably still dialing things in
all that_said
those draw backs weren't really_bad enough_to prevent us_from going_there again
because honestly the_food_is that_much fun
and vegetarians
eat_here
lots_of nummy nummy goodness for_you
and protip
chili paneer
yum_yum
eat_it
the_food_here_is fantastic
indochinese food_is a unique type_of cuisine you_can't find everywhere
the_flavor profiles are interesting_and complex
good decor_and good_prices
friendly_staff
new_location near my_office in_scottsdale
we_ordered items for to_go lunch
fried egg plant
chili_chicken and_shrimp szechwan style
all_were swimning in gooey sauces
two of_the_sauces tasted identical
eggplant was_good
but_there_were only few pieces and_it_was smothered in dark sauces
not_sure why all are_so soupy
reading from all_the reviews_here
i_wonder if i_went_to the_same inchin's bamboo garden
what's indo_chinese
i_went_in with open mind to_try_new cuisine
may be indo_chinese isn't for_me
may try_again
though
sunny az
amazing place
the_first_place i_liked that actually serves indochinese food
their schezwan chicken_and burnt garlic fried_rice are remarkable
also
they_are quick with service_and quantity of_food is_worth what_you_pay for
all in_all great_place
the_chili_chicken was_delicious
reasonable portion_size
good_indian asian beer_selection
definitely_will come_back_and try other_dishes
quiet
attractive decor
great_food
service could_be more proactive
we_got_the 'drums of heaven' to_start_with
they_were_very well_seasoned and_full_of_flavor
for_our_main course we_had_chicken manchurian which_was decent_but the_cauliflower manchurian was definately a_better dish
hakka noodles
american chopsuey were decent as_well
overall_it was_a_good_experience and_i_will_be dining there_again
also
it_would_be nice to_have_some outdoor seating
very quiet over lunch_hour
was exactly_what_i was_looking_for too
however i_hope_they aren't relying on their_lunch crowd for business
because_it's lacking
the_food_was_great
for soup
veggie egg roll and mixed veggies_and brown_rice
ladies working were super_nice_and i enjoyed_their company while sitting at_the_bar
i'll be_back
super_spicy just the_way i_like_it
the_food_was_great
was little oily but tasted really_good
the_service_was_also fast
i_felt it_was little expensive especially_the gratuity they added themselves for a_party_of
on the_whole a_must_try place
phenomenal
been_here twice
it's about a_half an_hour drive from_me
but imo it's_pretty worth_it
i_am_not an_expert_on_indian and chinese cuisine
but_this fusion was_just very_flavorful_and tasteful
they_have this paneer cheese appetizer_and it_tastes so savory_and the_texture is_perfect
it's_a_bit spicy
but i_love_the heat
the_first_time_i went
it_was_a sunday evening and_it_was soo packed and it_really affected the_service
it_was understandable
and it_looked_like it_was taking a toll on our_server
but_the_food really outshined
the_second_time i_went was the_following tuesday
believe_it or_not
it_was soo much better and calmer
it_was such_an enjoyable experience
there_was this server who brought_the food_out and_really took his time_to set_the plates_of food down equidistant from_all other plates
it_was strange
but pleasantly appreciated
the_server that took_our_order was_very_friendly too and_offered really_great recommendations
i_cannot recall the_names if the_dishes
but one_of_my_favorites was_a fish in_a chili cream_sauce
i'll be_coming back
great_place_for asian cuisine
if_you_order fiery
have_a glass_of_water next_to you it_really will_be fiery
overall ambience_is very_nice however the_music killed the_mood
it's_a very_warm
cozy next_to_the fireplace type_of ambience with rihanna playing in_the_background
it was_out_of place
overall great_place_for lunch_and_dinner with_friends and_family
tried_the american chopsuey
tad too_much sweet sauce for_my_taste
the fried_rice was spiced right
one_of_the best_places in us_that serves indo_chinese_food
the_other place_that comes_to mind similar_to inchin is_the chinese mirch on_the_east coast
out_of_the two inchin wins in_the_food quality_and taste_and the_options
also it stands out pretty well in terms_of the_ambience and_service
the pan fried chilli paneer_and 'drums of heaven' are_the shining stars of_the big menu
schezuan fried_rice and cauliflower manchurian fares out pretty_decent too
if_you_are_in_the phoenix_area
inchin is_definitely worth_the_trip
went_for_dinner last_night and_the_place did_not_disappoint
we_were_a big party
but were lucky enough_to get_one of_those big booth tables
and got_some privacy from the_rest_of_the hall
the_food_was_delicious and_the_best indian_chinese i've_had_in_the us
my_personal favorites_are the_chili_chicken
chili potatoes
and_the basil chicken rice
so_good
our_server was_pretty_good too
yes
it_takes a_while for_the_food_to get served
but_hey have you seen how_busy they_are on weekend nights
we_waited_for a_bit
but_the_food_was definitely worth_the_wait
oh btw
while you_wait
you_can always read up_on chinese signs and_pick on people at your_table
haha
definitely recommended
they have_gone from a_variety_of sauces to nothing
i_mean nothing not_even plain chili_sauce
sucks
one_of a_few restaurants_that offer indianised chinese_food
this is_as_good_as it_gets
i_came_here skeptical
but left a_fan
everything we_ordered was_good_and tasted_great
the_ambience_is also very_nice
if_you_have never_tried this cuisine
i_highly_recommend that your try_it here
the_paneer appetizer was_amazing
just loved_it
entree was_just fine
service_was slow
maybe we reached very_close_to the closing time
ordered_a mango mojito which_was basically mango frutti ith a hint_of bacardi
in_short wasnt worth_it
i_would_recommend it_as_a one_time visit
as_it_is the_only indo_chinese restaurant around
this was_my_first taste_of indo_chinese_food after coming to_the united states
so_there may_be_a possibility that my_opinion is slightly biased
firstly
the_ambiance is_definitely_worth mentioning
i_wasn't dining_in and_so cannot comment on_the service
but the_lady who took my_order was_very courteous_and welcoming
they_even accepted my yelp coupon and gave_me_a discount
the_food
dinner order_of a_starter
rice_and curry
was sufficient for_people easily
the_starter
chicken
was_excellent
the_rice too was pretty_spicy and_good
the_chicken_curry
i_guess_it was chilly chicken
could have_been_better
the pricing was_definitely not_cheap
but again wasn't too_expensive either
so
considering i_have this_place less_than_a mile away from home
i_don't_think_i have_any complaints
this_place_is indo_chinese
very_nice d_cor
cool atmosphere
if_you_like_indian
thai or chinese_food you_will probably like_this_place
the_food_has a_lot_of flavor_and spice to_it
if_you_are indian
this_is like little india inside with_all_the clientele
so a_great_place_to take_your indian parent who are_super picky
one note
their apps are_better than_their entrees
i_think_they do dry currys the_best but_with wet currys they_are not_as_good
if_you_love spicy_food
this_is_the_place_to be
the chinese_food has indian touch to_it which_i simply love and die for
portions_are little small_for_the_price
but thats all_i_can have with so_many chillies added
washrooms have_to_be worked on
have_to_be cleaner
and_there_was no diaper changing table
which_was_a discomfort
loved_the pan fried paneer and_the hakka noodles
main points
unique cuisine with_a_great ambiance
offers different sauces at table_to customize flavors
family_style
servings make_it good_for groups
review
inchin offers a_wide_variety_of fusion indian chinese_food
with_the focus leaning more towards chinese cuisine
i tried_a_few vegetarian_and non vegetarian_dishes
and all_were appetizing
my group particularly liked_the crispy lamb peking
the_ambiance was_very appealing
modern asian decor
great_for_a date when_you're tired of the_same old food_restaurant choices
the
burnt garlic chili fried_rice
sounded like it_would_be amazing
but there_wasn't really much substance to_it just lightly flavored rice_with a hint_of chili spice
also some_of_the entrees
though they_were different sauce choices
tasted almost identical if not_for_the different meats selected
however
the_tables come equipped with a_variety_of sauces
so_you_can customize your_meal to_your taste
definitely give_this_place_a try
you'll be_happy you did
our office has been_going_to this_place_for almost years_and we_loved it
they_have recently moved the_location to cactus and_have adopted the
chipotle
style_of serving and scaled back the_menu
we_had it for_the_first_time since the_change and_we wont be_going back
ever
very sad
at_the tatum store the_food service were always_good
that_is no_longer true
i_wanted something light
so i_ordered_the lentil_soup
it_was extremely watery with tons_of salt
in_fact i_think_it had_more salt than lentils
the_lentils were not_even cooked thoroughly
it_was_so bad
i_asked to exchange it and_they refused
my_dining companion had_a rice bowl
the_rice_was undercooked and barely warm
she tried all_of_the sauces
and liked the_curry
spinach
and vindaloo
the_masala was too_sweet
loved_the location on tatum and shea but_since they moved and adopted a_new
chipotle
style concept it_has completely gone down hill
the_food_is bland_and sitting_in containers for who knows how long
what a_disappointment and i_will_not_be going back or referring it_to my_friends
bring back the_old restaurant_and awesome cooks where everything tastes fresh_and_hot
what a_disappointment at bombay_spice grill tonight
we_were fans of_the full service restaurant_that operated nearby
but the_change to fast casual misses the mark completely
i_am_going_to assume that the_restaurant group behind_the treasured roka akor and nobuo is no_longer affiliated with bombay_spice
what_a change_from_the attentive servers and_the well thought out menu
the hip decorations and carefully programmed music
the_place has all_the vibe of_the dmv
with glaring cfl lighting and sparing decoration
this just_opened and the_walls had marks and the_floor was worn in spots
the_serving plates_and utensils seemed_to be of_the lowest grade
while_the napkins were just_a_little larger than_a paper bar napkin and not_as soft
the_hot samosa melted the tines of_the fork
we_went_there knowing that_they made_the change to the_concept
i_get_the chipotle style ordering and was_able_to figure out_what i_wanted
i_had chicken_masala over_rice
while the_lady had the_same with steak
plus veggies
we_also ordered_one naan_and some samosas
we_both found_that the_rice_was old_and dry_and the_meat overcooked
the_naan_was half a_piece
cut in half
the_samosas_were dry_and overcooked_and weren't ready until_we were_about to_leave
we_were nickel and dimes for_all these extras
including sauces
bombay_spice
i_will give_you one_more try in a_month
if_the_food is_better
i'll consider you an alternative_to the sub shop next door
i'll order_a
plate_of food
you'll never sell me any go alongs and_i'll never bring a_group_of friends
as_i did withe the_old concept
you're_not a_cool wine bar with healthier indian_food
anymore
also
don't_eat outside
that parking_lot has smelled like sewer since
major fail
once_a frequent diner at the_old sit down dining bombay_spice on shea
i ventured here hoping to_find_the same delicious flavorful healthy indian_food
instead i_found an_indian_restaurant set_up like_a chipotle
but_not executed nearly as_well
the_food lacked flavor and_the_portions_were much smaller than the_old location
my_heart is broken i_love love loved_the old bombay_spice
my_wife_and_i have what_we call good
food dar
if_we hate the_look of a_place
we_usually avoid it
and_the accompanying bad experiences
date_night at the_old bombay_spice was_a tradition with_their healthy menu
great_atmosphere and_excellent wines
we_tried out_the new_location with_the expectation that we_would be_happy
what a_terrible disappointment
this_review really breaks down into two categories
what_we think about_the establishment as_it_is now
and how_it compares to the_old place
which_was_a solid star_rating
we_walked_in and were_greeted by ray
the head cook from the_old spice
he_has real skills
so we_gave him a_chance
but alarm bells were_going off
the_sauces had brown deposits around their edges in_the warmer
the_meats had been_there_for a_while
we_ordered masala_with chicken
chickpea_ceviche and_some samosas
another guy_was there
but not_really helping
just standing around
ray explained that this_was_a
chipotle style
program now
my immediate thought_was that_it_was an affront to chipotle to_even compare
maybe theoretically
chipotle esque
perhaps
our_food_was slopped into some pretty_nice take_out containers
we kept them
as they_are washable
and_we headed for the_table
the_masala was_awful
if_that sauce is_not out_of_a can
then they_should move up_to canned sauce
the_rice_and quinoa were dry
the_chicken_was grainy and flaccid
the_samosas_were starchy
spice less and pulpy
the_chickpea_ceviche had_all the_flavor_of canned chickpeas
no tamarind_sauce was present
we doctored up_the masala_with hot_sauce to_make_it edible and_took a_few bites
i looked_at val
she glanced at the_door
ray smiled at_us
we_were trapped
please understand that_if_you give that chef good ingredients
he is_a magician
but_if_you cut your ingredient costs to_the bone and buy garbage
that_is what_you will serve
pre make everything
and_it slips further downhill
the_veggies were clearly a heavily spiced food service vegetable medley
is anyone in_the paradise valley area looking_for_a talented chef
save him from_this hell
please
and_let all_the former spice customers know so we_can come_to your place
i_said i_would compare this_to the_old bombay_spice
but_it's_not worth_it
they_are not_at_all the_same_thing
there_is no atmosphere
no wine bar
no lovely
caring servers
but_it costs pretty much the_same
not
awesome
it_is like running into your high school girlfriend
the_one who_was the love of_your young life
and_she is_a toothless meth addict trying to_get_a stolen atm onto her bicycle
that's how_much i hurt for_you
bombay_spice
tough love time
you have_gone from being my_favorite_indian_place to_the single worst indian_food_i_have_ever eaten
i_have heaved out_my guts in_a hotel bathroom after_eating better_indian_food than_this
so_i_am cutting you_off
don't call me
don't email
i_loved you so_much_that i_can't see you like_this
maybe some day i_will see golden light pouring out_of your windows and_happy customers sitting at_the_bar
drinking great wine_and eating fantastic_food
and_i'll come_in
maybe we_will_be friends again
but_it will_never be what_it_was
goodbye
what a_disappointment
they changed to_a
fast_food cafeteria
style_of service
which you_know actually means less service for_you
their old place was_nice since you_had table_service from a_very_nice menu_and you were_able_to sit and_enjoy your_meal
now it's_just
rush in rush out
and_the experience_is far_from enjoyable
i've recently seen this style_of service at_an_indian_restaurant near my home and_they_have closed within a_few_months of opening
the_portions_are smaller
the_menu selection reduced to a_few basics
and_the_prices_are ridiculous for what_you_get
and_they promote
healthy
but no_longer offer stevia as_a sweetener
instead your choices are sugar or health damaging chemicals as_a substitute
does any if_this make sense to_you
if_not
then go elsewhere
heck
chipotle is_just across_the_street and_they_have better_food and value_for your money
hugely disappointing
big fans frequent customers of_the tatum shea location for_years
this_new concept is_a bust
small_portions
limited food_options
plastic ware everywhere
sad_to say we won't be_back
i've_been_to the_old location and_loved_it
when_i saw that_it_was opening up a_wee bit closer to_my_house
i_was ecstatic
but_that didn't last very_long when_i showed up and_saw what_the place_had turned into
it's no_longer a_place i_want_to bring my_friends to
it's_a fast_food_joint now_and it's_quite disappointing
the_last times i_was_there
the_meat and tofu was dried up and_the quinoa as_well
i_think_i would much rather_go next_door_to genghis grill than eat dry indian_food_that has_been sitting_out for who knows how long
even the_samosas_were cold
i_don't_even want_to order wine to pair my food_in_a plastic container
one cashier said_they were_going_to change it_up and go_back_to the_old ways but_i_don't see_that happening anytime soon
i'm gonna give the_place one_more try before_i go looking_for_a new_indian_restaurant
it's with_a heavy heart that_i bring_you this_review of_the once beloved bombay_spice
you're dead to_me now
i_was a_huge_fan and frequent diner at the_old location
i_loved bringing friends there_and my_husband_and_i enjoyed_the wednesday date_night special on more_than one occasion
unfortunately
those are_just memories
there_is no_way i_would_go here_to enjoy_a glass_of_wine and samosa or curry
this new_location looks_like_a crappy diner and_the
chipotle style
order line just misses the mark
the_servers literally just dump food into_the to_go containers and man the till
the_food_quality and quantity has plummeted
not_to_mention the lost appeal of fresh_food
i_have some_friends who eat a_vegan diet and_they appreciated the ability_to request modifications to_their meals
not such
any more
the_lentil soup_was reminiscent_of the_old recipe but came_with about three bites and was_bland overall
rip
bombay of olde
i_think_it's unfair to_judge the_new restaurant_and_the new concept by the_old location
the_food_in the_new location_is fast
fresh
healthy
the_portion substantial
i'll eat my leftovers_for tomorrow's lunch
and most_importantly flavorful
the_chicken_was truly grilled to_perfection with wonderful spices blackening it a_bit
the_veggies
even though in_a warming dish were crunchy
spiced
not_spicy hot though
and_cooked just_right
chick_peas
carrots
broccoli
and cauliflower
and_all were_fantastic and appropriate
what a_wonderful alternative_to chipotle
burgers
pizza
fast_food
and all_of_the sub chains in_the_area_and certainly a_lot healthier
less expensive and quicker than ghengis khan next door
yasu's is the_only_other alternative for_a
good
lunch
everything else_is just standard
i_had_been to the_old location once
several years_ago
and_while i_love_indian_food
and_thought there's was_pretty_good
the_environment was sterile
the_food overpriced
and_the sit down experience awkward
say compared_to an_indian_buffet where you_know what_to_expect or an upscale scottsdale eatery of_which the_old location was neither
i_think_this concept makes_the flavors_of_india more accessible to_the common man or those intimated by an_indian_buffet or a_more
persian
style sit down place who might otherwise be intimated
i_really encourage anyone wanting something fast
fresh
healthy and_a_little different to_try_this_place and i_hope it stays around giving us pv phoenix scottsdale folks a_very_nice
affordable
tasty alternative_to pizza
burgers and subs
only suggestions are
the_menu board needs descriptions of the_flavors to_help the intimidated
what_kind_of curry_is it
red
yellow
etc
what does marsala taste_like or what_is it made_of
what_the heck is
vindaloo
any ways
also
why no tikka
that_should be standard or maybe_i missed it
i_like spicy
please
let each of_the_dishes be
spiced
up_to taste
kind of_like traditional thai fair
mild
medium and_extremely hot
i_agree_with the_one
don't nickel dime me_to death
comment
at least sell me_a
combo
where_the bowl comes_with naan_bread
who eats indian_food without naan_bread
or_the wrap comes_with_a samosa or a_drink or an optional side_of_rice
don't_forget_to put_a fork and napkin in_my
to_go
bag or mention it
just in_case i forget like_i did today
such_a bummer
turned a_nice restaurant_with delicious_food into_a fast_food_joint with mediocre food
booooo
i_never went_to_the original location
and frankly don't know what all_the crybabying is_about
you_can see_what this_place
has become
as_the full restaurant_is viewable from_the entirely windowed front_of_the place
anyway
this_place_is kinda lame and possibly misleading
it urges you_to
think healthy
with_that phrase plastered on the_windows in_a_very obnoxious repeating subliminal pattern
but_this_is some_of_the most greasy indian_food_i've_ever_had
i_don't get why the_spinach sauce has_to_be so oily
maybe it_makes sense for masala_as it uses butter or cream or_something
but_i_felt like_they just_went nuts with_the oils in_the_sauce
seems_to me_that adds a_lot_more calories than_what they post
the_tv plays this hilarious but demeaning indian tv channel that shows indian gangster rappers or_something
it's wild and probably off putting to_the high brow folks who have_given this_place_a bad review based on_its past incarnation
i_just think_it's stupid and silly
not_sure what_the owner's thinking
despite_the hoity toity crowd's whining
they_are right about one_thing
this_place_is fastfoodish
looks like_all the fixins come from a_bag
and_it's like_a hospital cafeteria
sure am glad my_entree was free with_some card i_got to_try_the place
anyone who pays for this_is_a sucker
great_food
reasonably_priced_and large_portions
i_like_the wide assortment_of grilled veggies as_well_as_the addition of tofu as_a protein option
choose a base
quinoa
brown or basmati_rice
a protein
beef
chicken
tofu
choose your veggies_and a_sauce or as i_like_to do_it
a blend_of sauces
having brought multiple friends here_as first timers
i_have gotten nothing but excellent responses from_them
i_appreciate the vegetarian_and_vegan options_and my_friends enjoy the_beef and_chicken options
everything has_been tasty tasty tasty
i_was_a fan_of_the old bombay and continue to_be_a fan probably because_i come_for_the food
not the_atmosphere
while hesitant about the_change at_first
i now enjoy_the flexibility that_this style_of restaurant provides
for_those who only came when_it first opened
some_things have changed including_the assortment_of available vegetables
as_a vegan diner
i_was_a_little concerned about_my options
however
i_think they've done a_good job of adapting to_a changing market as_well_as_the input of_their loyal customers
now
if_i_could just get them to_bring the_korma sauce back
something_that caught my eye immediately that seemed pretty odd but pretty_cool was the_chef was walking around_to peoples tables_and asking them how their meal_was
he_was also offering free samples of_the lemonade and the_chai
that's generally not_what i_expect when_i go_to_a place_like that
that gets points in_my_book
i've_been_to a_lot_of_indian food restaurants all_over us and_this_is definitely_one_of_the good ones
i've also spent a_lot_of time_eating fresh homemade indian_food_so i'm a_bit if_a snob and_always a_bit skeptical anytime i step foot in_a new_indian_restaurant
long story somewhat short
i_tried a_lot_of what they_had on_the_menu because i_wanted_to know how everything taste
i realized before_i ordered that_this indian_food_is intended to_be_a more healthy style_of indian_food_so i_wasn't sure_what to_think
once_i dug in i_could definitely tell that_it_was_a lighter style of_indian_food
still_had all_the_great flavors but_it_wasn't has heavy as the_indian_food i_normally eat is
all the_sauces_were awesome
all the_veggies were really_fresh
the style_and the_way you_order is pretty_cool because you_can see everything right in_front_of your_face and mix and match with_your dish
i can't_really think_of anything bad to_say about_the_place
i_did like_some sauces more_than others but_nothing was_bad
i def plan_to stop_in more often
the longer story for ya readers out_there
the_vindaloo_was really_awesome
perfect_amount of spiciness to_it and def a must_have for next_time
the_curry_was probably my_favorite
it_was really_really_good
i_could mix that with just_about anything at_home
not oily
not_to much flavoring
i'd_love to_buy a jug of_it and smother some wings
the_masala was_also really_good_and i def didn't leave any behind
the_mint_chutney was_really cool
it_was zesty and next_time i_go_back i'm gonna get_a wrap and_have_a bunch draped over my_chicken
the_tamarind_chutney was_nice because it_wasn't_too thick_and sugary
it_was_a_nice little addition over my rice
i_tried all the_meats and_they_were definitely good
i favored the_chicken_and tofu over the_beef but_it_was_still good
i'm_not really_a tofu kind of guy but_it_was definitely good to_have in_the bowl
it was_kind_of like having chunks_of pineer
the mango_lassie was aw aw awesome
i've never_really had_one that i_didn't_like though but some have_been_to thin for_my likings
the_manager asked_me if i_wanted_to sample the_chai and_the lemonade so_i did
i've never thought i'd get so excited_about lemonade but_that lemonade was_absolutely awesome
i'd_like_to make some_good cocktails with_it
if_it_was on_the shelf in_the grocery_store i_probably buy it once_a_week
the_chai was_also really_really_good
i've_always loved cardamom and_that chai was_packed full_of it
it_definitely didn't_taste like anything else i've ever_had
i_liked how_it was_cold too
there_was_also_a hot_sauce that they_gave to_me on_my_plate and it_definitely has_some kick but_it's got really_good flavor too
it_was_perfect because most_of_their sauces_are pretty mild but_i_like some heat added so_it worked out well
all in_all
i'll definitely go_back
it's_nice to_find_a place that_isn't the_same_as everyone else
one cool thing i_noticed
i_didn't_feel really weighed down after_i finished
a_lot_of_the time after eating_indian_food
i'm ready for bed
the_staff_was cool and_friendly and_the_place_was super clean
definitely check them_out
if the_place_is busy and_the bald chef isn't walking around offering samples
ask him for_one
i'm_sure he'll give em to_you
new_location new format old name
indian_food_is often relegated to lunch_buffets and white table cloth dinners
bsg offers_a new take on how indian can_be done
the build to_order layout is familiar for anyone who likes burritos
pick a_bowl or wrap
rice type
protein type
veggies_and sauce_and avid the pricey extras
a_meal can_be had for
i_had brown_rice
tofu
all_of_the veggies with_a truly spicy vindaloo sauce
this_is_not_the best_indian by far_as your protein and_veggies do_not simmer in_the_sauce
not is any one part_of major note
the_real reason for a_decent score here_is the ability_to get_some good flavors quickly_and at a_decent value
this_place_was so_much_better with it's previous format
they dropped half the_menu_and made_it more_like chipotle rather than_a sit down restaurant
the_food_is no_longer cooked in_the sauced
but merely topped with_it
after knowing what this_place_was like previously
i_am_very disappointed
really and a_half
but the_guys here were_nice
decent sauces
veggies
lassi
great lemonade
so_so chicken
i'd prefer a_buffet for_this money
we_used to frequent bombay_spice when they_were located at shea tatum and_always enjoyed_our dining_experience
we_even ordered from_them using delicious deliveries on_a_regular_basis
now since they_have moved they changed the_way they_serve their_food and_we love_it
the_service_was always_great and that_has not changed
they_brought back_the bhel_puri and made_it more_of_a fast_food setting
we look_forward_to even_more visits to_enjoy their great_food
not the_same level_of food as_it's old location
this_new style reminds me_of chipotle
except not_as great
i've been_there twice and_each_time i've been_a_little unenthusiastic about_the presentation
but_the taste_is still great
for_me
it's plenty of_food
others may think differently
we_never went_to shea
and_this_is our_first_visit here
i_was_surprised it is_like_a fast_food place
i_am kind of naive that_way
p
so ordering and getting your_food seems_to be fast
and the_employees were very_helpful and_friendly
i_had_a coupon and they_were_very patient explaining the terms to_me
we_got bowls
one drink
one naan_and one order of_the crispy chip like stuff
pappadum
total was
food_itself is_like stars
i_was_not that crazy about_it
but_i bumped it_to for these reasons
service_was_good
they_had the_following options
basmati_rice
brown_rice and quinoa
kudos for_the quinoa
aaaaand
the_vindaloo sauce_is in_fact hot spicy
which_is_a great thing for_us
tamarind_chutney was_delicious
very_good_food
i_liked_the curry but_i_think_the masala is_better
i_would def get a_side_of naan_and veggie_samosa
the_two guys working were_very_friendly
ok
so the_old bombay_spice was one_of_my_favorite restaurants
and_then they moved and_their reviews_here weren't great
so_i stayed away
but recently i_noticed their reviews improved
so today myself_and a_friend went_for_lunch and_i_am happy to_say_that bombay_spice is once_again one_of_my_favorites
their_menu has switched to_a more chipotle like way_of service_and a_couple_of my old favorites weren't on_the new_menu
but_i asked_about them_and was_told they_could make them for_me
i_ordered one of_those favorites and_a wrap from_the new_menu
my old favorite
the_chickpea_ceviche
was_as_good as_i remember
so_fresh tasting
light_and comparable to nothing else
just great_for what_it_is
the wrap i_had_was gigantic enough_for two meals and_also really_delicious
my_friend_had a_bowl with_chicken
rice
veggies_and the_vindaloo sauce
she loved_it
it_is_a very spicy_sauce but not_spicy just_for_the sake of_being spicy
it_was_spicy but flavorful
she thanked me_for introducing her_to bombay_spice and we_will_definitely go_back
as_it_was before
it is_also_a good_value
gigantic wrap was
i_think and way more_than i_could_eat for_one meal
service was_also_good and_everything appeared clean_and tidy
this_is_a_great place_to_get something different for_lunch or a_quick dinner
i_love the_chicken_masala wrap
as the_other_reviewers have_said
it_is_a
chipotle
type setup
as_in
you_choose your rice
your protein
veggies
and sauce
it's_really an_excellent wrap
i_also love_the bombay_spice iced_tea yum
i_can't_believe people_are sitting next door eating a bland jimmy johns sandwich when_they could_be having one of_these exotic concoctions
i_am really sad people_are giving this_place bad reviews
but_i never went_to_the original location
so_i'm_not sure_what they_are comparing it_to
if_you_are coming in looking_for_a traditional indian_restaurant
that_is not_what this_is
so set your expectations accordingly
i_miss the_old location
they tried to_make_it indian chipotle now and_the_food just isn't the_same quality
it's_really a_shame
my_boyfriend_and_i used_to love the_old one as a_date spot and_it's gone forever
i_wish_they would bring back their traditional restaurant style_of service like they_had in_their old location
this_has gone way down hill since moving_to this_location
the_food they_offer is_decent but nothing_like they_used_to serve
the_menu_has been scaled down tremendously
please bring back the_original bombay_spice
i_love_indian_food
yet i'd never_heard_of bombay_spice when they_were in_their original locations just a_mile away from_where they move to several months_ago
a_friend notice their new locations so_we_went
the majority_of the photos i'd reviewed on_yelp are_not from_this new_location
the former place was_more upscale in atmosphere whereas the_new place_is more_of_a fast_food type place_where you_go up_and order your_food
not necessarily a bad_thing
the_owner chief brought_us our_food because_it_was taking them just_a_little time to_get things ready and_he was_extremely_friendly and_sat with_us for awhile
the_idea_of and inexpensive fast indian_restaurant_is a_good_one
they changed their formula from_their former location he_told us
they_have another new_place with_this same formula they just_opened in downtown chicago
they_give very large_portions
i_ate only half of_mine and_took the_rest home_for the_next_day
prices_are_very_reasonable
however when comparing taste to_other_indian_restaurants
almost_all more expensive
in_the_valley they_don't measure up
i'd_go back_here
but_if i_wanted good tasting indian_food i'd_go elsewhere
i will_give them another try at_some_point
great owner
staff
large_portions
supposedly healthy and inexpensive
a_nice combination
but_when_i want indian_food
i_want good taste
we_enjoyed a_tasty meal_here two excellent curries
prepared exactly as we_ordered them
very_spicy
naan_was reasonably_priced
and just_right hot
fresh
but_not drenched in butter
we_were shocked to_get such good_indian_food_in a suburban location in_a city not known for_its indian_cuisine
apparently this_location used_to host a_restaurant called india gate
restaurant
com is_still selling vouchers for india gate
this new_location won't honor them ask_them if they're india gate
and they'll say yes
i_asked
is_this india gate
and the_hostess replied
yes
one_of_their menus still says india gate
but expect them_to honor the discount
and_you'll be_disappointed
they initially claimed to_be totally unaware of the_problem but_on further questioning admitted that at_least_one other customer had come_in with the_same problem
follow up emails were equally unsuccessful at resolution
i'd give them stars_for food
maybe even_in light of_the alternatives in_the_area
but unethical behavior like_this earns a_huge drop
soo yummy
i've_been_to several buffets_and have_had many homemade meals at friends' houses
this_buffet is_very_good
not_sure where the_bad reviews are coming_from
the_food_is_very flavorful
the_best is the_fried vegetable that_is_a circle
maybe eggplant
the mushroom mattar and_chicken_tikka
naan_is not_that_great but_everything else_is so satisfying and_good
i_can't_wait_to_go_back
oh they aren't open_for buffets on monday anymore
found_that out_the hard way
i_have_to agree_with kira
i_work in the_building directly next_door_to minerva
so_we watched with anticipation as_they took_over the_spot that_was formerly occupied by china star
notes
opens at
am for_a_lunch_buffet
we_arrived_at
am and they_weren't ready
tables_were nearly filled before they_were ready_to go
so we_made our_trip through the_buffet at_around
pm
nice_selection of various dishes
all_were very_tasty_and well prepared
limited selection
overall
seems to_cater_to more popular items
which_is smart
but_if you're looking to_try_something different
it's unlikely to_be on_the_buffet
friendly_staff
prompt service
waters were always refilled
plates quickly cleared away
reasonable_prices
very dirty inside
lots_of construction dust
and_just general dirt
never once saw waitstaff wipe down tables after people finished_eating
they'd clear them
dust
them off
and_then set new settings
no area to_wait
there_was_a line of_people waiting to_be_seated
limited seating available
so
i_liked_the food
i_liked_the staff
dirt doesn't really bother me
but_i couldn't help but notice just how unkempt the_place seemed
especially for_being newly opened
i_hope_they can_get some_time to scrub things down_and that_they more regularly wipe down tables between diners
heck yeah
talk_about the system working
props to matt who started the awesome thread on_yelp madison talk re
openings and closings
http
www
yelp
com topic madison the official madison openings and closings comings and goings thread
and thanks_to steve for letting the community know_about this_new indian_joint on junction rd
it_may have_taken me a_few_months to_get her otherwise
i_was bouncing around_the threads last_night
saw
indian
and_got in_the car
i_called on my_way to_make_sure they_were actually open
folks
this_is easily the_best_indian_food_i've found in_madison for_three reasons
the_menu
holy cow
it's huge
i_went for_dinner_and spent forever pouring over each and_every page
looking up a_few items_on my_phone because_they_were new to_me
no shortage of_variety here
the_dosas
this and_this alone should make_you speed over
i_think_they have
that's nuts
nuts
i'm_used_to seeing maybe or different kinds at a_place
the_flavor
everything_i tried was_incredible
and_although spice heat is key to indian_cooking
theirs is_well balanced
and not_so hot that you_can't taste anything
i_had vegetable jalfrezi
chicken_tikka_masala
masala_dosa and_garlic_naan
all_of it_was_awesome
get these things
even the_garlic_naan
which_i sort of feel like is tough to_make incredible
but_it_was incredible
it arrived at_the_table piping_hot_and aromatic and_didn't have_an offensive garlic flavor
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was some of_the_best_i've_had
topping some_of_the curry_i long for in_london
the_veggies were tender yet crisp_and in_a super tasty sauce
and the_dosa
ohhhh the_dosa
it_was_good
not_my_favorite
but_with so many_options
i_can't_wait_to get_back and_try another one
maybe more adventurous than this_one
huge props to_the stellar staff that made_sure we_had_no questions about the_menu
kept water_glasses full
and_told_us they_will have beer wine liquor soon
just wrapping up_some paperwork
they_also sent us home_with leftovers in boxes and_gave us extra rice
very_kind
the_atmosphere ain't much
so don't_go expecting to_be transported to_india or_anything
there_is some_nice stuff hand painted on_one wall
but_that's about_it
small space
bright light
no tunes playing the_night i_was_there
i_didn't notice construction dirt or dust so_i'm guessing they cleaned up after what sounds like_a rushed opening
and_my feeling has always_been
if_i'm there the_first week
i'm_going_to make a_few exceptions anyway knowing they're still trying_to find their footing
these_guys have though
and_if food remains consistent
this will_be my_go_to for_indian stuffs in_madison
read corey's review earlier today and_decided_to revisit with_a_group_of coworkers
amazing how well the business responds to feedback kudos to_them
tables wiped down_with cleaner after each diner finished
saw it happen every_time
looks like they're cleaning up the_last little bits_of leftover construction stuff
much better_than yesterday
food_was once_again superb
i_tried an entirely different round of_items and_loved every single thing
the_buffet_is not_only a bargain
but_it_is delicious
service_was_excellent quick refills on drinks
plates cleared
buffet well_stocked
and everyone_was so_friendly
so
huge props to_the folks running this_place keep up_the great work
and_i can't_wait_to_go_back_and visit_again
and i'm_sure i_will
at last
madison has a_place_that serves proper
dum biriyani
all the_other_indian_restaurants in_madison serve some_sort_of weird amalgam of pulao and_chicken fried_rice but_this_is the_real deal
try it_out if_you_have never done so before
another thing i_liked about_this_place was their_menu
it_was_really broad and covered multiple sub types_of indian_cuisine mainly northern
chinese
yes
southern
i_haven't_had to_try_the northern or_the chinese but if_the_food i_had_was anything to_go by it_should all be_good
i_tried out the_chicken dum biriyani chettinadu and_both_were awesome
the chettinadu was_a_bit too_spicy_for my palate
and_i_like spicy_food and_have higher threshold than_most
but biriyani more_than made_up_for_it
since_they just_opened a_week or_two ago i'll_have to update this_review after_i try_the dinner
lunch_buffet was_good_but unfortunately at a_buffet most_places tone down the_spice_level
which may_be_a plus_for most_people
given_that this_place_is minutes away from swagat
my_go_to indian_buffet
and minutes away from dhaba
not a_buffet
but pretty_good
i_think they_have_some stiff competition
however
the_dinner_menu
online
has_a pretty wide_variety_of dishes_that i_don't_think you'll find_at the other_places
so_i'm looking_forward_to trying that
oh
and for_my year old they_have chicken nuggets on_the_menu
cause he ain't fooled by chicken_pakora
service was_nice_and friendly they_kept coming around with dosas
which_was_nice
kinda a_weird cramped layout with_the seating
the_place almost seems too small for_a_buffet
all in_all
if_you_like_indian_food i'd_recommend giving it_a_try
i_love_indian_food_and am quite picky_about it
there are_very few tremendous indian restaurants_in_madison
this_is_the top
the_spice and_flavor was_delicious_and_the gulab_jamun was_so phenom so make_sure_you save room
i generally do_not like buffets at_indian_restaurants either because_of_the options available or because the_quality_is not good_enough
the buffet_at minerva surprised me
it_was_actually very_good
some_of_the things you_can look_forward_to
malai_kofta_was very creamy
mango_ice_cream tastier than usual
garlic_naan_was soft
paneer_tikka max masala but_tasty
something_to note
the_menu_has a_lot_of options
minera is_one_of_the lousiest indian eatery places in_madison
service sucks
there_is not_even a_single good thing_about this_restaurant
the_owner has no_idea about_how to_run a_restaurant business
in_the era of technological advancement and social networking
the business does not_have_a running website
lunch_buffet_is_a 'copycat' of another restaurant_in_town
minerva tried_to even place the_same items in_the_same location as the_other one they_don't_have any originality
and surprisingly they_have_the same items even
can't they_have something different of_their own
standard of lunch_buffet_is nothing great
even food_quality of dinner_is nothing to_die_for
tables are_too small_and cramped up
a_person table is ideally suited for persons
the_restaurant_is very_small and cramped up
when people line up for_the_buffet
it_is_a complete chaos
for_dinner
the_person tables do_not even_have a_table cloth
wait_staff sucks they_don't_have any idea_of what they_are doing
in dinner_there is_no control of_the ordering status
the_wait_staff has no_idea whose order is_what and when_the_food comes_out the_staff does not does not_know in_which table to_bring the_food
it's a_big chaos
amongst this
the turnover time for_the_food_to come_out after order is placed is rather quick
which_is appreciated
we_tried certain dosas
the south_indian delicacy in_which the_restaurant specializes in
the_dosas came without_the sides
sambar
chutney
had_to_ask_for the_same
which_is ridiculous
the_sambar
chutney_was stale and had_no great_taste
sambar felt like having grains of sand in_it
the_other families who_were dining with_us in_other tables_were equally unhappy with_the_service
we_ordered_a rava masala_dosa they messed up_and an onion rava dosa came out
when_we mentioned that_the ordered_was messed
they_took it_back inside the_kitchen_and put the_masala in_a_small bowl and_brought it_back out
that_was terrible
appetizers are_served in small side_dishes of corelle brand
the_restaurant even does not_have proper serving bowls
they purchased cheap dishes_for serving food
this_is_a substandard restaurant
they_have made_the menu_items very attractive encompassing all different platter but that_has back fired on_them
nothing is turning out great
had they emphasized on_their strength and specialized on south_indian platter
they_would done a_better job
the south_indian food_is_great
tried chicken times
the_meat_was terrible every single time
they_do_a decent job with the_curry so_i kept giving_them a_chance
bad idea the_meat is_always horrible and_sometimes even stale
the_staff_is_friendly
the_menu_is huge
i_wish_they could back it up_with quality
it varies based on_what you_order
i_guess they try to_offer too_much and_its not_good value_for_money with stale meat entrees
i'm on_the fence with this_one
will write another review after_i try hyderabadi and_other types_of dishes i_haven't given them a_chance with yet
def no chicken though
yuck
i_would_give a
stars if_i_could
stupid yelp
i_am honestly surprised_at the negative reviews
but disclaimer i_have_never_been to_lunch
i generally find indian_lunch_buffets
blah
i_have_been_to dinner three_times
and the_food_is_great
their_service needs some help
see below
so here_is the_thing i_have lived in_madison for yrs
and the_indian_food scene has_been very similar a_lot_of mughlai food
the_restaurants improve or go down depending on competition
minerva offers_a breath of_fresh air in_this routine
yes they_have_the usual tikka_masala
garlic_naan
mango_lassi
etc
all approved by_my caucasian husband
but they_have dosas
idlis
chettinad and_indian chineese
cuisine that_is great_as_well
that_i_have missed and really_enjoyed
so here_is the break down
pros
extensive_menu for_dinner that_will appeal to both indians and_non indians alike
awesome true dum_biryani
chicken is_all tangy and flavored right
andhra spicy dosa_is good
and actually spicy
food always comes_out quickly
cons
weird layout
seem short staffed always nice and_courteous
but needed more_people
lacking ambiance
tallying the_bill always seems to_take_a while
overall food is_my_first priority so minerva is_a keeper
as an_indian i_think_i view minerva and dhaba as the_best_indian_restaurants_in madison right_now
while the_restaurant may be_going through some opening pains
no website
opens at noon at weekends instead_of
somewhat cramped quarters
the_food_is superb and_the_staff remarkably kind and_friendly
i'm hopeful it_will just get better with time
and perhaps find they_need a_larger location
the page menu_is a_real treat in itself with something_for everyone
that_there_is so_much south_indian makes this a_great spot for_those needing to_avoid gluten
i_really_enjoyed_the lunch_buffet the couple_of_times that i_have_been_here
i_am not_familiar_with the_names_of many_of_the dishes but_i know_that i_really loved the_flavors_of many_of_the dishes
they_have fantastic rice and_lots_of meat_options
i_am_a big goat fan
no judgement please
and i_want_to say it's among the_best that i_have_had in_the_city
the_service in_this_place is_also standout
the few_times i_have_been_here the_staff have_been extremely accommodating and ultra pleasant
i_am happy_that this_place_has opened up so close_to_my office as_i foresee many visits in_my future
my job brings me_out to_lunch for_indian_food quite frequently
so_i'm glad there's now another option on the_west_side
i'm usually accompanied by indian dining companions when_i hit the_buffet
but this_time our_group of gringos
yeah
yeah
i_know indians don't call us_that
was on_its own
fortunately i_was aided by some_indian fellows behind me at_the_buffet who_had eaten there_before
so_i only_had the good_stuff on_my_plate
the_food_was_good tandoori_chicken cooked just_right
masala stewed with_the right blend_of_spices
mango_ice_cream to freaking die for
minerva might lack the_ambiance of swagat or my_favorite
dhaba
but_the buffet_food is_right up_there with swagat's
minerva is_in_a location that seems_to cursed
its predecessors had_a tough go
but they're doing it_up right and_have as_good a_chance as anyone to_make_it a go_here
my_boyfriend_and_i went to_this_restaurant last sunday for_the_first_time and_we tried_the_buffet and_since we_started to_eat we noticed the_difference between the_other_indian_restaurants we_have_been to_and this_one and minerva it's so_much_better
every single thing_we tried_was sooo tasty
my_favorites were
the_chili_chicken
the channa_masala
garbanzo beans in_a creamy_sauce
the deep_fried vegetables
they_were sooo crispy
and_their cottage_cheese
it_was sooo delicate i_did_not want to_finish eating_it
we would_definitely come_back_for more
the_only_reason_i gave them stars its because the_buffet area it_is_so small and_i_think they_should rearrange it
they_have_the main entrees in_the narrower side where most_of_the people stand most_of_the time
they_should put them in the_beginning area
where everybody start_to get_their empty plates since it_is_a more open area
oh
no i_hate to downgrade these_guys because the_staff_is so_friendly
it's_a clean_place and_they work hard and_do so_much the_right way
however
there_are other_indian_places that sell my_favorite_dish for_about the_same_price
but use tender chunks_of white_meat chicken
my vindaloo here had what_i assume is dark meat
with_what many of_what_i consider to_be inedible pieces
tough
grisly
veiny
fatty
i'm not_going_to rule out returning here
but_if the_price_of an_entree is_going_to_be comparable to_the competition
i_would_suggest to match their quality as_well
for_the aforementioned reasons
i_wish these_guys the_best_and i_will_be_back
i_hope my suggestion helps
i_probably will_not end_up back_here anytime soon
the_food_itself was_very unique in_the way it_tastes seasoned
some_of_the dishes_were quite_spicy for general buffet options but_i_don't knock it for_that
some_other broken english star_review user review only exists for_this which honestly screams a_review by_a competing restaurant yet i_agree_with a_bit
the largest problem is the_space
space and_service
our_server
not_sure if_we_had one assigned
seemed new or nervous and spilled water all_over
after changing seats
we_were more or less ignored beyond our initial drink
there_was little communication as_to who our actual server_was and_wasn't even sure where to_get_the bill
after a_while of_being ignored
we_just walked up_and got_it
but lets face the ultimate problem the_space
it_is like taqueria guadalajara seating combined with_a buffet table set in_a strange corner alcove
the_buffet table itself even borders tables where you_may be_seated
do_you like having people constantly standing right by you grabbing food_or lining up
the strangest thing_is when you_get_to the_end_of_the buffet_line
it's_a dead end and you_have_to like walk awkwardly around people_to try_to get_out
it_seems nonsensical
and_like another review said when there_is a_lot_of_people waiting to_be_seated the_place has_a very strange limbo zone by the_door where_you can't_really get_in or heck even goto the bathrooms from the_dining_area
i just_don't think the_space itself_is suitable for an_indian_buffet
buffets need a_lot_of spacing for_the constant amount of_people getting up
lining up_and returning_to their seats as_well_as_a logical flow and layout for_the_buffet plates
instead it_is_a dead end with seating similar_to a_high school cafeteria
be_prepared_to sit next_to strangers
i'm hooked on_the_lunch_buffet
they_have_a good_variety and serve some different_items than_the other_indian_buffets i've_been_to while still remaining familiar
the_two things_that enamor me_to minerva over the_other nearby indian_buffets is_that_they allow the_lunch_buffet to_be carried out_in a_to_go box and cup and_it's slightly cheaper while being of the_same or better quality
the_only_downside to this_place_is there_isn't much seating
of_us_had a_very_nice dinner_at minerva on_a busy saturday_night
we_had recently read_the review in_the isthmus and_decided_to give the_restaurant a_try
indian_food_is one_of_our favorites
took_about minutes_to_get us seated_and menus were handed to_us promptly
for_the_next to minutes we_went over_the hundred ninety three items_on_the_menu
each of_us_had a_favorite item in_mind even before we_sat_down
our_waiter_was an_authentic_indian who knew the_food very_well
unfortunately it_was difficult_to understand exactly all_of his comments but his enthusiasm and humor overcame any of_those shortcomings
we_loved the_experience and would_like_to go_back
highly_recommended
i_am_going_to come right out_and admit that i'm_not an_expert_on_indian food
i infrequently visit indian_restaurants_and the totality of_my indian_cooking experience_is baking a_couple batches of naan_bread_and cobbling together a presentable chicken_tikka marsla
so_if_you are_looking_for the definitive review on_the authenticity of the_cuisine served_at minerva
this_is_not that review
with that_said
i_felt my lunch_buffet experience_was a_ok
i_thought the_quality_of_the_food was above_average by buffet standards
the_staff members were hard working and_extremely cordial
things i_liked
the
lunch_buffet offers an abundance of_options
it_took three trips_to the_buffet_to sample everything
including the_desserts
the_lamb_curry
the chicken_tikka_marsala and aloo_gobi were standouts for_me
the_staff_was constantly replenishing the_buffet trays
so the_food in_the_buffet stayed fresh
it helped that the_restaurant_was at capacity for_lunch service
loved_the caramel custard dessert that dish alone has me jonesing for_a return_visit
there always was_a staff member near to_the_buffet to answer questions and to_offer suggestions for dishes to_try
the_servers_were extremely diligent about keeping beverage glasses filled and clearing dirty dishes
things i_didn't
the_naan_bread_was a let down it_was_too dry for_my_liking
i_also did_not care_for the watered_down coconut soup
the spartan interior_of the_restaurant_is nothing_to_write_home about
as corey d mentioned in_his review
it_definitely will_not transport you across_the ocean to_india
in_addition
the_buffet_is wedged into an alcove and_it_was difficult_to maneuver through the_other diners
sitting near the_front door during polar vortex season subjects you_a cold breeze every_time someone walks through the_front door
for_a cuisine known for_its extensive use_of spices
i_thought_the buffet_food was timidly seasoned
it_can_be hard_to understand the_servers
other observations and ramblings
there_was_a line to get_a_table by
so come early to_hit up the_buffet
why is an_indian_restaurant named after_the roman goddess of wisdom
is it_just me_that wonders about things_like that
i_never write reviews
but this_was_one_of_the worst restaurants_i've ever_been_to
i_got_the shits from their_food
i_didn't even_get sick when eating street_food in_india says something_about minerva's cleanliness
over_priced portions
my bagara baingan contained only tiny
slices of eggplant
the_rest
sauce
i've_had much better value in_nyc indian_restaurants
our_waiter and waitress both needed to_be reminded several_times about our_order
they seemed_very disorganized
completely forgot items
chai
naan
dosa
and_a main_dish
bringing chai minutes_before we_got_the check
and_the_naan after_we packed the doggy bag containers
waitress was_also pressuring me to_buy alcohol
dosa and_naan_were soggy and_extremely greasy like dripping grease
they_also forgot the crucial chutneys to_go_with idli
food_quality and_taste didn't make_up for any_of_the negatives
won't even bother getting into specifics
we_were very_polite guests
and my_dinner companion gave a_large tip
despite_the lousy service
really wish that_he hadn't
getting sick from_the dinner tipped me over_the edge and inspired me to_write
i_really_love indian_food
and know_that it_takes a_lot_of care and skill to prepare
i_always have_a positive bias toward indian_places
and_give lots_of leeway if the_owners_are tackling foods from multiple regional cuisines
i_felt that both their northern and southern dishes_were executed poorly
taste aside
on account of_service alone
this_place deserves one_star in my_eyes
avoid this_place
i'm_sure you_can find better
p
s
why'd they name the_restaurant after_a roman goddess
star_because it is_the_only restaurant_that offers really south_indian_food in_madison
it adds much diversity to madison's food scene
we_tried dosa_and uttapam
they_are real
get_a ghee dosa
it_would_be both a_month opening and eye opening experience if_you_have never_tried it_before
fish_curry was_a_very memorable dish
we_also_tried things under_the
chettinadu
category
good_stuff
they_have_a incredibly long menu
it will_take maybe visits to savor the_full selection
for first few visits
i_suggest sticking to things you_can't find_in other_indian_places in madtown
based on_our two dinner visits
both food_and_service is_pretty_good
i_hope this_new establishment on the_west_side will thrive in_the coming years
caution
the
hyderabadi dum chicken_biriyani
is insanely spicy
i_like spicy_food in_general and_take on very spicy_dishes
but this_dish will_be over_the limit to most_people
consult before you_order
i_first went_to minerva a_week after it opened
i_have_never gone_to any_indian_restaurant ever again in_madison
this_is mostly a_south_indian restaurant_but their_tandoori_chicken is_better_than any_other punjabi owned restaurant_in_madison
though tandoori comes from mostly punjab area
their south_indian menu_is huge_and bigger than_any you will_find in_india
all_the meals i_have_had from_them is_authentic
dosas so_many varieties
all exceptional
medhu vada needs improvement
biryani try hyderabadi dum_biryani
chicken_biryani
amazing
all there curries i have_liked
for_some_reason not_a_big_fan_of the indochinese stuff as personally i_do_not like sweet in_my food
but thats me
their kala chana is_good
garbanzo bean
ask it with_some bhatura
not on_the_menu
but they_will make_it for_you
aka indian chhole bhatoore
really authentic
buffet is_good
good_selection
and_tasty
because_of place being small
they_don't_have many waiters
and usually waiters serve the_entire clients so service may be slow
but_i never mind it
as_the_food makes_up_for_it
their nihari is_not authentic
in_the pakistani british cuisine section
as authentic needs to_be cooked for hrs or_more
plus this_restaurant_is not pakistani so don't_expect authentic nihari
go_for_the dosas
biryani
chicken_curry
etc
fish molly was_alright
i_have lived_in kerala and have_had the_best fish mollys so not_a_big_fan here
that_said
this_place_is wayyyyyy better_than taste_of_india
taj
dhaba
swagat
maharaja for authenticity
not ideal for_a first date because_of ambiance_and service_and noise level
but who goes to_an_indian_restaurant for a_date and come_out smelling like biryani on_their finger tips
btw i_go_there about times a_week although_i lie plus miles away
so_good is this_place
my_husband_and_i tried minerva for_the_first_time today
the food_was_outstanding
as often as_we eat indian_cuisine
i_am_not good_at describing most dishes by name
what_i can tell you is_that_the selections on_the_buffet were_fresh
hot_and deliciously seasoned
plus
there_were several offerings on_the_buffet that_i've never_tried elsewhere
it_was_nice to_try_something_new
the_tandoori_chicken_was especially moist_and meaty
not_at_all dry
the_spices in every_dish were just_right
the_only_thing_i found missing from_the condiment section was_the salty mixed relish that i_enjoy on_the side
this_is_a smaller sized restaurant
and_it_was nice not to_have_to stand in_a line to_fill my_plate
despite_the smaller dining_room
the_size_of the_buffet_and number_of dishes offered was equivalent to both_the larger indian_buffets we frequent
if_you_are_a fan_of_indian buffets
you_will_be very_pleased by the_quality_and selection
indian_food_is spreading like wildfire
of late
for_me
that's_a darn_good thing
last night's food_was right_on the_top_of the_list along_with dhaba
my sweet pakistani beau showed up_at my_house with takeout
i_was cold_and tired from walking outside getting ready for_a k
putting me_and k in_the_same sentence is crazy
anyway
the_food from minerva was_just what_the doctor ordered
we_ate the hyderabadi dum chicken_biriyani and the_fish_curry
i_loved both_dishes equally
the_heat level_was
medium
which for_me was_perfect
the_rice in the_biryani was_lovely and_perfectly prepared
each grain stood alone
the_chicken was_on_the bone
tender_and plentiful
the_fish was_excellent
not overcooked_and really enhanced by_the curry_sauce
we_had both plain and_garlic_naan
they_were fluffy_and tender even_after reheating
we dipped the_bread in_the curry_sauce not leaving behind even one drop
the servings sizes_were generous_and today i revisited the biriyani for_lunch
glad_i didn't_have_to share that last portion
simply the_best south_indian_food in_madison so_far
their pongal vada is_to absolutely die for
just_the_right_amount_of dal
ghee and cashews
and_their dosas wow
they_have over a_dozen varieties all scrumptious
i_also_like their madurai idli spiced_and fried goodness
their sambhar and coconut_chutney is also_good
not_really a_fan_of most_of_their other_dishes though
i_prefer the_other indian_restaurants_in_town for north_indian food
so
this_is quite complementary since_i don't really_like_the others' south_indian fare
their_service is_decent and the_owners_are nice
not giving because their quantity to price ratio is_a_bit low understandable for_an upstart
but hopefully they_will fix it_in due course
lunch_buffet_is delicious
its a_small dining_room
but definitely_the_best indian_place i've_been_to_in madison
probably one_of_my_favorite place sin madison so_far
minerva is_simply the_best_indian_restaurant_in the madison area
they_offer an_amazing lunch_buffet
with_a_nice selection_of both south and north_indian entrees
desserts
soups
and salad
their dinner_menu also_has many_options to_choose_from
both vegetarian_and non_vegetarian
not_only_is the_food as close_to authentic as you'll find in_madison
it's_also very_reasonably_priced
the_wait_staff_is polite_and attentive and_there_is_a parking_lot with ample free parking
whether you're_a connoisseur of_indian_food or_just trying_it for_the_first_time
you_won't_be disappointed_with minerva
ordered the_chaat items
have_had much better
the_green chutney they add_to chaat is_the idli chuney
not meant for authentic chaat
havent tasted anything else
so cant comment
we_tried different_dishes
apps and entrees
and_every single one_was delish
we're definitely_going back soon
this_is_a no frills kind of_place
so don't_expect the_most meticulous dinner service
go there_for_the amazing_food
yummy yummy lunch_buffet
and a_great_value at
there's about large buffet carts set up_in_the corner of_the_restaurant
and_they_offer a_large variety_of_indian offerings
i_think_i tried just_about everything and_couldn't find one i_didn't enjoy
their_chicken_tikka_masala is_so amazing
i_probably could've had plates_of just_that and been happy
i_also loved_their chicken
i've_never_had anything like_it before and_it_was delish
they_also offer garlic and_plain_naan
as_well_as_a sampling_of many_different chutneys and_sauces
wasn't too_busy when_i_was there
i was_one_of about people dining_in
but the_server_was constantly taking plates_and refilling water_glasses
i_think i_can_say_that i've had_better_indian_food
but_this_place offers an_awesome lunch_buffet_that i_will_definitely_be_back to_enjoy again
awesome and_definitely my_new favorite_place
the_only_problem is it_is_on the_wrong side_of_town
i've been trying_out all_of_the indian restaurants_in_madison and_the surrounding areas and stopped_in_for the_lunch_buffet_at minerva after_reading the_other_reviews on_this site
i_was extremely disappointed
i_arrived around
the_lunch_buffet goes until
and everything_i tried_was cold_and looked picked over
there was_just_a small amount of each_of_the vegetarian_dishes left so_i tried a_little_bit_of all of_them
the food_tasted fine
but_i've definitely had much better_indian_food
i_was_hoping they might bring_out some_more food that_would_be hot
but the_only food they_brought_out while_i_was there_was rice
i will_not_be_returning
pretty_good indian_food
i_have_eaten here multiple_times
and_each_time the_food_was_delicious
it's_a_small place but_we will_certainly going back
freshly opened where ann purna once was
bindi kitchen_and cookery school is_a mighty impressive new_place
showcasing vegetarian street_food with_a gujarati and east african influence
the extensive selection_of dishes i_tried were_all excellent
with_the spinach_and aubergine curry the_best among many wonderful items
i_look_forward_to my_next_visit
later this month
so overall
we_said
bindi was_an absolute revelation
rarely have_my socks been so comprehensively knocked off_by a_place
each_dish was outstandingly good
and_the warm_and knowledgeable service_was truly joyful
i'd_recommend you visit soon and_you visit often
as this_is_a superb new addition_to edinburgh's rich tapestry of restaurant excellence
the heady scent of incense filled the air in bindi as_the yelpers gathered for_their vegetarian_indian thanksgiving
the chairs were squashy and high backed
arranged around a quirky t shaped table arrangement
among those of_us seated next_to_the large_and beautifully decorated plate glass window
there was_a_little shuffling and struggling to slip in_and_out
but_the passing of plates_and dishes_to those least accessible made_for a_fun party game and added_to the celebratory atmosphere of_our gathering
tanya l had brought hand turkeys
and julie g
in_addition_to gobbles the turkey beanie baby
who served as our_table mascot
had brought two big boxes with_her containing pumpkin pie
the_staff
far_from being offended that we'd brought our own dessert
were_more_than happy_to take them into the_kitchen until they_were needed
and_even brought_out_a specially made pumpkin curry to_add to our_dinner
with_two gluten_free diners among our number
the waitresses were_also quick to_go_and check suitable dishes_with the_kitchen
clad as_they were_in stunning fitted dresses heavily laden with mirrors and detailed embroidery
it_was_a joy to see_them float around_the restaurant_with giant smiles
it_felt like_they loved being there as_much as we_did
i_had_a chat_with one_of_the waitresses about_the gorgeous outfit and_she confessed she_had been thrilled at_the opportunity_to wear it when_she began working_there
looking_at_the prices on_the_menu
i assumed that all_the_dishes would_be tiny tapas like things
so_i_ordered two from the_starter ish part_of_the menu
and_a_side on my_main
knowing full well that julie g's pumpkin pie was_still to_come for_dessert
big mistake
it's_a wonder i_could drag my bulk all_the_way home after a_bunch_of little square poppodums
some_of claire l's delicious sweet potato crispy curls
three amazing batata vada
sort of fried spicy potato patties
a grated carrot salad the_name_of which i_can't_remember
a_thali served_in five silver dishes
and_a royal raita of seasoned yoghurt topped with_what i_think was pomegranate seeds
and whenever i_felt_like my_mouth was_on fire from all_of_the spices
perfectly balanced to create
not disguise
flavour
i_took_a sip of_my passion fruit juice
yes
indeed
passion fruit juice
why does everywhere not serve passion fruit juice
i_had two glasses_of that stuff
and_what did my_bill come_to for everything_i ate
apart from_the sweet potato curls i snaffled off claire and_the delicious slice of julie's pie
i_know
right
it_took a_bit_of fiddling and faffing among us_to sort out our bills individually at_the_counter but_the_staff remained helpful_and cheery throughout the_whole confusion
which ended the_night with as_much warmth and affection as with which it_had begun
they're starting cookery classes here_in january
if it'll teach me to_make food even half as_good as what_i had last_night
i_will_be sorely tempted
tl
dr version_of this_review
go_here
stars and deservedly so
quiet but friendly_staff and bindi herself is_lovely
telling us about different_dishes on_offer
food was_superb
i_like eating veggie anyway and_don't mind missing meat so this_place_is vegetarian heaven
lots_of little bites
shared platter type dishes_and a_thali choice_of curries with_rice_and chapati's
being gluten_free i_thought_that i'd miss out_on_the chapati's but_no
myself_and jenny got gf versions which_were lovely
the pumpkin curry made specially for_our gang celebrating thanksgiving was so_yummy
i_did order too_much_food the_chilli fries were lovely
as were jenny's casava chips
lovely
freshly cooked onion bhajis and poppadoms i_was stuffed afterwards and_felt guilty about leaving such yummy food
the attention_to detail in_the spice_and combination_of flavours was immense and blew me_away i_am hoping to_go_back soon
i_was_in work the_following day_and recommended it_to a_friend
vegetarian
who went that_night
loved_it and_is already planning a_return trip this week
drinks reasonable the sauvignon blanc was great_value at per bottle and_went lovely with_the_food i'd ordered_and a_bottle at is_very_good value as glasses are
i_tried some_of cressi's passionfruit juice which_was gorgeous too so if_you_are avoiding booze then try_this
great little_place
amazing food_and_service and such great_value
being gf
don't_let_the menu fool_you as some_of it_looks quite wheat based as_it_is based on street_food many_dishes can_be adapted to suit such is bindi's knowledge of dietary requirements
this new_indian_restaurant has brought someone
once_again
new to_the edinburgh indian dining scene
vegetarian_indian street_food
at very_affordable prices
not_to_mention the_lovely
relaxed restaurant_itself
and_the very lovely staff
with_the beautiful saris and bindis
i_came_here_with a_larger group_of yelpers for_a delightful
delicious meal
first_off
their_chai mulled wine is delicous
for a_glass
it_comes in_a_small glass
so_it means if_you_order three it's totally just the_same_as one big glass
and the_same_price too
the_menu_is quite like_a tapas offering
lots_of small dishes that_can_be ordered as starters
or a_few together as a_main
i_took the_special mango starter
and_some chips
and the_thali for_main
for the_thali
at dinner_time
not_a lunchtime special
yes indeed
it_is all_vegetarian
but_i do think_that indian_food is_the_best cuisine for vegetarian_food
and_you wouldn't notice that_there_is no meat
all_of it_was_delicious
beautifully spiced
each_dish tasting distinctly different
handmade with love
this tastes_like good
home_made indian_food like_your mum would_make
certainly_not en masse bland creamy
red
'standard spice' indians that used_to define a british indian carry_out
the_lentil dish on the_thali had a_lovely texture
and_the nuttiness of the_lentils wasn't drowned out by spice
they_even did gluten_free bread to_go_with the_thali for claire and myself
that_was_a really_nice
thoughtful touch
i_will certainly_be coming_back_here
you_can_get_a delicious
large feed at_a_very affordable price
possibly one_of_the best deals in_the old_town
and_one_of the_most delicious
we_ate here_for our_first thanksgiving in_edinburgh
and what_a memorable meal it_was
i've never come across a_restaurant quite like bindi before
the emphasis on vegetarian street_food means the_menu_is quite different_from most_indian_restaurants in the_uk
we_started_with_the bombay chowpatty taster
which was_full_of interesting things
the_chaat was especially delicious
this_was followed by a_thali
which at was probably_the_best quality for price main_dish i've_had_in this city
the_wine by_the bottle was_also delightfully well_priced and drinkable
service_was_friendly
welcoming
and_accommodating
if_i have_one little complaint
it_is that_my hair and clothes reeked of incense when_i_got home
and the_next_day
the_smell_of incense didn't bother me in_the_restaurant
but_i prefer not to_come home_with lingering odors
but incense or_not
i_will very_much look_forward_to my_next meal at bindi
out_and about on_a_friday_night and looking_for some where new to_try and_the missus remembered about bindi
taking over from anna purna's the_owners have_done a great_job in giving the_place a_much needed face lift
on entering the_restaurant we_were greated by_the very_friendly patricia who showed us to_our_table
the_restaurant_has_a comfortable feeling about_it with_a cobination of clean modern decor_and traditional_indian in places
we_both fancied a pint so_we opted_for_the cobra which is_the_only draught available
there_is quite_a range_of food_options available here_that neither of_us_had sampled before
also worth noting this_is_a vegetarian restauarnt
we_opted_for the nashto sampler to_give us a_good cross over of_dishes
to accompany this we_also opted for chilli cheese toast
a bombay version_of cheese on toast
and vadhu pau
bombay's version_of the 'chip butty'
who could resist descriptions like_that
first up was_the popadoms which_were home_made
as were each_of_the dips
the corriander and_what appear to_be methi was_a favourite
the_main_dishes were_great with_the chip buttie and the_cheese on toast being my_main favourites
the_cheese on toast has_a a_bit_of_a punch and reminded me_of bruschetta with chilli and veg
we_had_a chat_with one_of_the_owners and_she said_that the_menu_was based around food her and her sister like to_eat but cannot find in_edinburgh
i_really_enjoyed my_experience here the_food
service_and setting were_excellent
we_had an_amazing time_at bindi on friday_night
and_it_was easily the_best vegetarian indian_food_i've had_in_a_long while
their selection_of dishes is truly unique and_the_restaurant is_a_very welcome addition_to edinburgh's already colourful indian scene
i'm already planning my_next_visit
d
this_is_probably going_to read funny as_i'm doing it chronologically rather than in_any sensible order
so we're the_first people to_arrive at bindi on_a_friday_night
no_one hears us entering so_we stand around chatting loudly for_a_few minutes_before going looking for_someone
it_didn't take long and_an incredibly friendly_and apologetic woman sat us down
the_menu isn't standard indian_fare and neither of_us_had a clue what_to_order so we_asked_for advice
there_are_a pair of tastery things
an exotic one and_a down_to earth one
naturally we_opted_for the exotic one
believe_me i_was unprepared for_what game next
the eldest of_the ladies serving arrived with a_selection_of tasty looking things
one_of which required a demo
this lady pour some liquid into a_little deep_fried bowl thing and_said 'quick quick
and popped the wee thing stright into_my gub
quite unexpectedly materal i tell you
amused my_friend no end
the_starter platter thing consister of_things
which i'll fail miserably to_describe
see above deep_fried bowl thingy
so there_was_a crispy bowl with raw red onion_and other_things into which_was pour a vinegar type liquid
some bahjii esque things
something that_was_a cross between cous cous and bombay mix with pomegranate in_it
and little lumps of saut d african root vegetable
they_were_all delicious
although the_last one was_a_bit chewy like it_wasn't fresh
everything else though was wonderfully light_and zingy and i'd_have happily eaten another round of_them straight away
for_our mains we_both_had thali which i_felt for a_little small_for a_main on_its own
it's daft cheap though so_i clearly didn't order enough_food
i_had_a desert of_a sweetened yoghurt
some thing_that_was like_a rice_pudding but made_with vermicelli
according_to the_lovely lady who runs the_place
and_a semolina thing
incredibly delicately spiced
i_had_an almond milk shake with it_too which_was mmmmmmmmmm devine
overall wonderful free delicate tasty spicy_food
very_reasonable but small_portions
i_do have_a pair of grievances however
firstly i_ordered_a diet coke and_got a_tiny glass for
it_was clearly poured from_a l bottle so_i_am rather irked by_the stingyness of_it
secondly our_water jug had a_big chip in_it
a concern at_a lack_of attention_to detail
that_said they're just starting up so i'm_sure there's some teething to_be done
and_i'll definitely go_back because plain_and simple the_food_is_good
i_came_here a_couple_of_weeks ago for_the_first_time
and treated my_dad to_an inexpensive lunch
everything on_the_menu_is
euros
which really isn't bad_for most items_on_the_menu
the cafe is close_to_the university of_edinburgh
making_it a_great spot for_a_quick student lunch
the_interior_is clean_and spacious
there_are_plenty_of places to_sit
though it_seems_to be gaining popularity these days so booking is recommended
i_opted_for_the thali
whilst my_dad took the_veggie burger
the_thali was very_spicy and_tasty
though the_portions_were quite small
there_were two small fried chapatas
two curry_dishes
one was_very interesting_and memorable
fried chickpeas balls in_a spicy gravy
a_small portion_of saffron rice
my dad's burger patty was_also apparently very_good_and came_with a_selection_of interesting spicy dips
the_only_thing_that let it_down was the_quality_of_the bread
he said it_felt like it_had_been defrosted and would_have preferred a fresher tasting roll
bindi herself was_very_friendly
and gave_me_a free shrikhand for pudding
a strained yogurt pudding spiced with cardamom and saffron
it_was_delicious
the_table water came served_with mint_and cucumber inside
which_was a_nice_touch
overall
nice food_but small_portions
and the_bread could_be better
will_be_back though
the_restaurant_is clean_and bright
the_service_was_great_and the_concept is_really interesting bombay east african fusion street_food
we_had fried classics like onion_bhaji and batata vada as_well as mogo
cassava
fries and turmeric hued fried_rice
the_mango_lassi_was not_overly sweet
while the_food_was_good_and fresh
if mostly fried
i_am only giving bindi stars_because one_of_the dishes_we_ordered
chili paneer
that_was labelled
gluten_free
was not_really gluten_free
it_had soy sauce in_it
which does contain wheat
for celiacs
this_is_a problem and you_should check with the_waitstaff before ordering
the_owner apologized for_not knowing that soy sauce contained wheat
she_was really lovely
but celiacs do double check on_the ingredients in_the_food you_are ordering
excellent new_indian_restaurant
great vegetarian_food and_delicious lamb
this_restaurant_is a_welcome addition_to monona
they_also have lunch_buffets every_day
we_will_definitely_be_back soon
this_place_is_great
there_are_no indian_restaurants_in_the monona area and_i_am so_glad they_put this_one here
the_lunch_buffet was_delicious_and_the staff_are attentive_and genuinely want you to_be enjoying the_food
delicious
swad is a_wonderful treat
my_husband_and_i went_there opening night_and was amazed by the_menu
not_only_is the dining_experience affordable
but the_food_was_fantastic
i_had_the rogan_josh and_the homemade mango_ice_cream
yum
i promise you_will_not be dissapointed
we_were_both quite pleased with_this new_restaurant in_our neighborhood
i_ordered_the fish moly
a catfish cooked_in_a coconut based cream_sauce
it_was mild
and_very_tasty
my parter ordered_the_chicken_tikka uthappam
a flat gluten_free pizza styled dish that_came_with both coconut and tomato chutnies and_a delicious sambur
all for_dipping
excellent meals
the_nan_was tender
the_service_and atmosphere great
we_are happy to_have_a new favorite_restaurant

we_are happy to_have_a new favorite_restaurant
so_excited that_this neighborhood has_a fantastic indian_restaurant
the_food_is_great and_the_staff are_so welcoming
even to kids
swad means tasty and_it_is
i_highly_recommend_the lunch_buffet
not normally a_fan_of buffets
but they_kept the_food fresh_and_hot
the_coconut soup was_delicious as_was_the tandoori_chicken_and homemade mango_ice_cream
several fo the_dishes_were milder than expected
but perhaps that_in itself_is to_be expected
service_was timely and_attentive
simply the_best_indian_food_i've_had since living_in madison
as_good as milwaukee indian_restaurants easily
we_had_the buffet on_a_saturday
the_place_was_packed but we_got_a table right away
the_staff_is super_friendly and_really
really attentive
had_a_little of_everything chicken_tikka_masala_was dynamite
as_was_the shahi_paneer
chana_masala and_the ghobi manchurian
let's just put_it this_way
the_only_thing_i could recommend as_an improvement over what i_had_was hotter onion chutney
it's really_good
just_not as hot as i'm_used_to
here's what else i_tried
all amazing
mint_chutney
fresh hot_naan brought to_your_table
included
and they'll bring_you more
veggie biryani
goat_curry
chai_tea and kheer for_dessert
plus_the bonus
the_place_is really surprisingly lovely_and charming given_the strip_mall it's_located in
yay for monona
wonderful
the tastes are very_fresh_and flavorful
i_especially loved my appetizer
aloo_tikki chat and_the curry_chicken
can't_wait_to_go_back_and eat more
amazing dinner
reasonable_prices
and so_many vegetarian_options
i'm_going back to_try_the_lunch_buffet soon
seriously the_best_indian i've_had
it's cheap
a_buffet
and_the_service_is phenomenal
went_there today after noticing it_and fell in_love
it's_right near by and_i_was legitimately upset i_didn't_have more room in my_stomach
absolutely going again very_soon
had to_check_it_out again a_few_weeks after my_first_experience
zowie
just_as solid across_the board
this_time my year old came along
she loved_it
again
don't_expect spice in_the_buffet
it's tame
but
order_off_the_menu for_dinner or take_out_and they_can heat it_up
what_i'm really enjoying is the_staff and_the owner's attentiveness
they're not perfect
but_when the_waiter forgot my chai he_was_very apologetic
brought_it right out
and_didn't charge me
loved_the dahl
more vegetarian entries would_be nice
everything quite_tasty
nice setting
we_went here_for_the_lunch time buffet
the_buffet tables are set_up in the_back_of_the dining_area in such_a way that the_line queues up pretty quickly yet moves very slowly
some_of_the dishes_are harder to reach in_the_back left corner
the_food_itself is_ok
the_one stand_out dish_was the manchurian cauliflower
the_staff demeanor is_about the_same_as any_of_the other_indian_restaurants around madison
not particularly friendly
but_not downright rude either
i_like_the decor
dark red
black
and gold colors
and_lots_of wine bottles up behind the_register
the_day we_were_there they_were having technical difficulties with_their debit machine and_were asking everyone to_pay by check or cash
i_think_they have potential
they_just have a_few_things to_work out
yay for_indian_food_in monona
lunch_buffet highlights the catfish and_the sesame chicken
hubby_and brother joined me and_i_think each made three trips through the_line
a variety_of_dishes
table served naan_bread_and mango_ice_cream
of_course buffet_is the_way_to_go
the_space is new and_clean
service quick and_attentive
buffet diverse and_fresh
we will_return
the
best
indian
food
ever
period
great_food
wonderful family atmosphere
good was_hot and_delicious
the extensive_menu had all_the standards of a_great_indian_restaurant
as_well_as_a number_of innovative items
and south_asian classics that i_haven't_had since i_lived_in india
the_vegetarian dinner_for_two was enough_food for_three people
with a_take_out container to spare
we_will_be_back innumerable times_in the coming months
we plan in being regulars anytime we_are_in the madison area
the_family owners_are incredibly sweet
and_the_service_was impeccable
it_felt as_if you were_being treated to_dinner in someone's home rather than at a_restaurant
my_favorite_indian_restaurant_in madison
delicious
i_went_here recently with_my_husband and a_friend because i_had_a hankering for_indian_food
atmosphere pretty_nice
nicer than many_indian restaurants_i've_been in
while unassuming on_the_outside
it_is actually quite_nice on_the_inside
bonus the_warm towels they_give_you after your_meal smell amazing
wait_staff courteous_and friendly
i_feel_like it_took them a_little while to_take_our food order after we_ordered drinks
food the_food_here_is quite_good
i docked a_little for_two reasons
my_husband_ordered his_food medium_spicy but said_it had little to no heat
my_friend_and husband both agreed it_was_pretty_good but not_the_best_indian they've had in_town
my chicken_tikka dosa was_excellent
so if_you_like dosas
i_recommend it
overall impression i like_this_place and_will likely be_returning
it's_nice to_have an_authentic_indian restaurant_in monona
went awhile ago
forgot_to review
drinks
mango_lassi salted lassi
both yummy
appetizer
non_vegetarian platter
combination_of fish
chicken and_shrimp pakoras lamb seekh
yum
and_i_don't generally like lamb
entrees
garlic_nan
and_cheese nan
chicken_curry
and fish_curry
the nan's were killer
the_curries we_ordered medium hot
and they_came out mild
so_we sent them back
we_got
medium
back
and it_was_good spice_level
my chicken_curry the_meat_was kinda gross
big hunks
kinda freaked me_out
ate_the sauce_with the_nan
and it_was_good
not a_cheap place
but good_food
the_service_was lavish and deferential
the_entrees_were wonderful
but the_buffet kinda blew my socks off
everything_was new to_me
but fresh_and_delicious
lunch_buffet_is the_way_to_go
lots_of options
and_only each
the_lamb_was the_best_thing on_the_buffet
the_chutneys are_all quite_good
the ice_cream with exotic spices is_excellent
the_mango_ice_cream is yummy too
lunch_buffet was_a_nice sampling_of indian flavors
staff_were friendly_and kind
not a_great name for a_restaurant
but_the_food_was tastier than_other local_indian options we've tried
nan_was freshly made
and_hot off the_grill
my_husband_and_i have visited swad twice since_moving near by and_it's very_very_good
we_both love_indian_food
and so_far swad has not_disappointed
we began with an_order_of vegetable_samosas
they_were_very fresh
hot
and were_very_tasty
they_had_a good spice
but were not_spicy
the_first_time_we had them_the tamarind_sauce was_good it had_a_little body to_it
more recently
it_was_a_little watery
we also_ordered chicken_tikka_masala
mixed vegetable_curry
and_plain_naan
their tikka_masala_is a stand by for_us
and theirs is_very_good huge hunks of white_meat chicken
creamy_sauce
the_first_time we_ordered_it we_asked_for it_the be between mild_and medium
more recently
we_asked_for it_to_be prepared in_the_same way
but it_was_a_good bit_more spicy
we_asked_for the_mixed vegetable_curry to_be medium
both_dishes ended up having the_same amount_of_heat which was_a_bit too_much_for me
next_time
i'll ask_for mild
at the_same_time
they are_both good dishes
there_are tons_of vegetables in the_curry
just thank god for_the water
this_place_is becoming our to_go place when_we want_indian
the
best
indian
in
town
we_know the_owner from going_to the_maharaja on the_west_side
i'm so_happy he opened a_restaurant near where_we live now
it's so_good
there_are a_ton_of choices for_everyone and the_samosas_are quite_tasty
the_staff_are friendly and_courteous
the_lunch_buffet price is_outstanding and the_items featured in_the_buffet are_quite delicious
i_ate_here last_week with_my adult son we_both love indian_cuisine
while_it was_perfectly fine
i_do_not agree that_it's the_best_indian_food_in_town
the_samosa chat was_delicious
but both our_meals and_the_naan were exceptionally greasy
as_in leave_a pool of grease in the_bottom of_the basket greasy
service_was less attentive than hoped
although water_was refilled regularly
at_this price point
i_didn't expect to_have_to box up my_own food maybe that's why they_give_you the_great smelling towels
this_is_the_best indian_food_i've_ever_had
my_husband_and_i crave their_chicken_tikka_masala
we_never seem_to pass up the_fish pakora either
delicious_food_and friendly customer_service make swad a_very welcome addition_to monona
probably_the_best indian_food_i've_ever_had
with service to match
highly vegan_friendly too
which_makes my_wife ecstatic
this_restaurant may_not look_like much
situated as_it_is in_the_middle_of a_small strip_mall
but the_interior_is very nicely_decorated
i_felt a_little underdressed walking_in mid road trip wearing a t shirt and shorts
but_that_was similar attire to_the_other patrons
my_wife_and_i started our_meal with complimentary papadam
which we_were already prepared to_order
they arrived promptly with several types_of chutney
all vegan_friendly no less
crisp
delicious and_left us wanting more
but_not because we_hadn't had_enough
they_were just done perfectly
the_rest_of our_meal consisted_of steaming hot gobhi manchurian
bainghan bhartha
rice
chapati for my_wife_and garlic_nan for_me
it_all arrived_at once
just_as quickly as_the papadam
the battered fried cauliflower was chewy but crisp
perfectly spiced
we_went_for hot on both_dishes
and paired nicely with_my garlic_nan
also_excellent
it_was_the standout dish of_the_meal for_me
the_eggplant was_excellent as_well
with_good roasted flavor
throughout_the_meal all the_staff_was_very attentive
our_waiter specifically asked_if_we were happy_with_the spice_level of_our_meal
our water_glasses_were rarely more_than half empty
at the_end_of_the_meal one_of_the staff even_brought over steaming hot lemon water sprayed towels to clean up_with
by the_end_of_the_meal we_were_both nicely full
for_a very reasonable_price
just an all_around excellent experience
i only_wish it_had_been closer_to home
i ate_at swad the_other_night and was_a_little underwhelmed
i_tried their_chicken_tikka
and_it_was fine
i_think_it was around_for a pretty_small portion
a friend_ordered the_goat_curry
and for_about the_same_price had even worse luck
his meal_was chock full_of goat bones and very_little meat
making_it a_terrible value
i've had_better_indian_food in_madison
and at_a much_more affordable price point
i'm_really confused why dinner_at swad costs so_much
the_portions aren't even that big
it's_a_nice
intimate space and_the_staff members were_all_very nice
but for_my money
i'll stick_with maharaja or taste_of_india
i_love_this_place
have picked up take_out times_and always_been extremely happy_with everything_i order
top_notch service_and_food
our_server_was an absolute delight
will come_here again_when we're in_the_area
the_food_at om restaurant is_pretty darn_good
i've_never_had indian nepalese_food so_this was_a_very interesting experience for_me
we_came to_this newly opened indian nepalese fast_food restaurant by accident
but once_i entered the_restaurant with my_friends
we_could smell the_curry which_made our mouths water
if_you_like spicy and_flavorful food you_are_in luck
if_not
then try their_chicken momo's
which_is nepalese dumplings
which_is just awesome
a_must_try
my_friends got hot spicy chicken_wings and_i'll say they_are sooooo good
one_of_the best wings i_ever_had
what a_great_find
i_cannot_wait to continue exploring their_menu
the_food_here_is fabulous
will_definitely recommend
my_son and i_went_here last_week for_lunch
it's great to_have another_indian nepalese option in this_side_of vegas
this_is more_of_a fast_food establishment with adequate seating
good_variety_of both vegetarian_and non vegetarian_dishes
the_customer_service is_great and_they_are willing to spice up the_dishes upon request
we_found some_dishes a_little mild for_our taste but_overall the_price_is relatively cheap and_the_quality is_pretty_good
nd visit
first_time ate off the_buffet_and was_decent
i_was thinking if_the_food that's been_sitting here all_day is_pretty_good then_i bet the_items cooked to_order must_be great
sure enough was_awesome
tandoori_chicken some of_the_best_i've_had
chicken chili good
wing good
asked i'll definitely be_back_for tandori_chicken and try_some veggie_dishes
place_if for_sure legit
also prices_are_very_reasonable
def
check_it_out
good fast_food
limited vegetarian_dishes
but test is not_bad at_all
nan_and pakoras are made right in_front_of you
as an_indian
i_am rather fussy about food from_my country and_while i_will often put up_with mediocre offerings
i_am_very pleased_to report that the_food_here_is very_authentic and_delicious
ethnic food seems_to finally be making some firm inroads in_the henderson eastern corridor
om is_the latest addition
just south of serene you_have_to look_for it
since it_is set back a_bit from the_street
it_is_a relatively small_restaurant with a_definite take_out setup and vibe
the_food_is all laid out_on_a steam table and_the_menu choices are clearly displayed on big light boards behind the_counter
the_food_is on display with matching photographs on_the_menu boards
the basic premise is_very similar_to panda express a_side plus entrees
with entrees
sides offered are naan
white_rice
pulao rice
and noodles
as with pe
you_can select a_half and half combo of two_different sides
three of_us ate_there and between us we_tried_the chicken_tikka_masala
lamb_vindaloo_and chili_chicken which were_all terrific
on_the vegetarian side of_the_menu
we tasted the_palak_paneer
aloo_gobi and the_daal
i_didn't_have any_of_the veggies
but my_friends gave them_all a_strong thumb's up
i_expect to_be back_there frequently
both to_eat_there and for_take_out
oh_my gosh
yuuum
we_went_here after work today and_it_was so_delicious
all the_food_is prepped and_if you_want_it spicier they_will make_it to_order for_you
garlic_naan is_so_good
they literally make_the dough when_you_order it_and cook_it in_an industrial tandoor right there for_you to_see
the_food_is_delicious
the_staff_is super_nice_and friendly
i_ordered_a entree plate with chicken_tikka_masala as both entree's which_they were_more_than happy_to do and_basmati_rice for
this_was an_amazing deal
my_girlfriend ordered lam vindaloo as both entree's and_basmati_rice
you_can choose rice_or naan but_you_can also get an_extra order_of it_on_the side for
and_its huge probably before being cut about the_size_of a_small pizza plus its amazingly delicious
if_you_want quick
delicious
well_priced indian_cuisine this_is_the_place for_you
we_will_definitely_be coming_back_here and_i suggest_you all go
wow
is this_food amazing
no lie
try it_out
it's some_of_the best india cuisine i_have_had and_i travel all_over_the country
i_can't_wait_to come_back to_have_some more
i_may even have_it for_lunch tomorrow before my flight back_home
good_food
especially_for indian fast_food
better_than any indian_buffet at_a fancy indian_restaurant
i've tried a_lot if indian_places around_town and_i cook indian_food and_this_place_is yummy to_me
holy shit
this_place_is_good
ever wanted to_eat_at a_place so_much
that your butthole cries for mercy
get the_naan
by far
this_is_the_best naan i_have_ever_had
i_have_to_say that what's been missing from the_entire las_vegas valley was indian fast_food
i_was_hoping this_place would_make the cut and_i_am glad_to report that it_does indeed
it's_not the_best_indian_food_i've_had but_for fast_food and an_amazing price
this_place_is absolutely stellar
must get the_naan
it_is the_best_i've_had
walking_in i_felt_like i_was back_in california eating delicious cheap indian_food
they_have serving trays full_of items but_we stuck with_our usual items_to compare_to other places_in_vegas
we_ordered_the_chicken masala
lamb vindalo
cauliflower
samosas
garlic_naan
pakora
and kofta
the kofta was_my_favorite
i_was_really impressed how much_flavor it_had and_it_was made_with chicken instead_of ground beef
the_lamb vindalo was my_next favorite
the_lamb_was falling apart as_i_was putting it on_my_plate which was_a_great sign to_see_that it_was_actually slow cooked
the_sauce_was on_point too
overall we_had_a_great meal between the_of_us
left with_a_couple_of to_go containers and_didn't spend a_lot_of money
i_can't_wait_to_go_back and_try other_dishes that_we missed
i_was_pleasantly_surprised at how_good the_food_was
i_would defiantly be_back_again
nice variety_of foods
quick easy lunch
great_prices and_staff was_extremely_friendly
the_food_is_amazing
i_wish_the owner all the_best_and give them my support and hope everyone else in_the_neighborhood gives them a_chance
its a_small fast_food place and_doesn't look_like much
however the_quality_and flavor profile the_family puts out is_better_than some_of_the the overpriced fine_dining places_in_town
they keep there overhead low to provide great_prices to there customers
trust_me im a foodie and_am highly impressed
go try_it
nepalese indian_restaurant_and chaat house
halal
wholesome and_delicious himalayan bites
owned and operated by_a friendly
professional
and beautiful nepalese family
clean_and casual dining
great_location
next_to_the highway on i and eastern
will_come again
and_again
and_again
inshallah
om
more_like nom
haha err
i_actually haven't_had indian_food_since i've moved_here there just aren't that many_places and_they aren't cheap like the_bay_area so when_i found_a place_in_vegas that_had curries for as little as
i_couldn't pass it_up
one could_easily have_a_good meal_here for around dollars an ounce serving_of curry_and_a naan or some_rice
and_if_you go_for a_groupon yelp amazon deal
you_could have meals for for whole days
the amazon deal we_used was_a for deal and_we_got different curries
garlic_naan
and a_mango_lassi and_only paid about dollars on_top_of the_deal we_got
while the_curries here aren't the_most flavorful or original
they taste
to_me
pretty authentic
the_naan wasn't wrapped up_in_the best method they_just kind of stuffed into one foil
but they_still tasted very_good anyway
the truth is if_i_could just keep eating
i'd probably stuff my face with_naan and_curry until_i burst
but_then this_food wouldn't_be so economical
this_review_is just from a_take_out perspective
i_had_a free voucher from lv local and used it trying om
i_was_pleasantly_surprised with_the_quality and_flavor of_the_food
we_order two combo entree's for
each and_i_ordered_the aloo cauliflower
chicken_curry
chili_chicken
and_naan
the_naan_was naan bad
not_bad
would have_given them a_star but_not all the_entrees_were available_for the_combo meal and_the_portions_were small
i_guess i'm spoiled from panda express
anyways i_will_definitely return because_it's close_by and inexpensive for_indian_food
may give an update on review
hope_this helps
i_was_surprised to_see_this fast_food type indian_food place
the_food_was_good_and at_first didn't_think the_portions_were going_to_be enough but was_full when finished
i_would return again at_some_point
i_prefer the buffet_style indian_restaurants where you_can choose your menu_items and_go back_if desired
tried_this_place using my groupon
i_don't live in_the_area so i_don't_know_if i_will be_able_to use all_my groupons
according_to the_lady
i_can_only use one at_a time
the_food_here_is very_good
it's_definitely a_must_try if_you_are_in_the area
for_take_out only
my employers have_a weekly
food offering
where_we have food brought in
to_help raise money for_a charity
i_usually don't support this practice
especially since its every_week
but today
there_were two reasons why i_tried_the food they_brought in from om
i'm_a sucker for good_indian_food
and_when the_restaurant_was announced
i
of_course
read up on_yelp_and was_impressed_with the_reviews
they_were actually offering vegetarian_options
my employer has_a very sad habit of offering vegetarians a_ton_of carbs
with_no actual veggie offerings
i'm_not_a vegetarian
myself
but_in support of_this option
i_opted to_try_the veggie_korma
and the_aloo_gobi
wow
the_food_was_so flavorful
i only_had a_few_minutes to_eat on_my break
but_i absolutely inhaled this
i_can't_wait_to actually go the_restaurant tot ry out the_samosas
and the_lamb_vindaloo
great first impression
om
well done
my_favorite in_las_vegas has_been mint_for last years
i_have_tried many_of_the other popular indian_restaurants_and none_of them have_come closer_to mint
until last month
one_of_my friend recommended this_location to_me_and said_that food_is cooked in_front_of you and_the_prices_are reasonable
i bookmarked this_location on_yelp_and i_finally went_for it one_day
its located_on a plaza by_and eastern
this_area is_always busy with_many restaurants_in_the location
so parking might_be_a small issue
the_restaurant_is not lavish like many other_indian_restaurants
they_have tv where some indian_music is played but over_all its atmosphere_is more_like roberto's
the_owners_are nepalese
and_the_food_is mainly north_indian with_some that_have obvious nepalese fusion to_it
i_always_get two curries
naan and_basmati_rice at this_location
so_far i_have_tried chicken_tikka_masala
palak panner
spinach w cottage_cheese
my_fav
chilli_chicken
chicken karai
and their_garlic_naan
i_think_this restaurant_has the_most_authentic indian flavor of_any restaurant and_the_food_is cooked fresh in_front_of you
this prices_are also_very low compared_to taj and_mint
and_its an_excellent place for_take_out meals
when_i first went to_this_restaurant
they_were running a promotion of off the_entire bill for_only month of march
this made_the deals even_more special
i_also saw that_they_do deliveries now
i_highly_recommend that_you stop_by to_try_out their sampler plates
thali
which come_with entrees_and side_dishes
they_also have groupon_and amazon living_social deals
overall
this_is like_the himalayan version_of panda express
you_get_to pick a_place with_two or three meats and_a_side
the_place_is spartan and_clean
you_get_to watch bollywood musicals on the_tv
that's always a_plus
the_naan_is perfectly_cooked
it_is_not hard like_some places serve them
the_sauce for the_various meats were_tasty
they_were the_right kind of_spicy curry
the_meat however was tough
it_has_been sitting_out in_the steamers for too_long
i_think
their deconstructed samosa_was a_bit_of_a mess
it_doesn't taste_like how a_samosa should be
hearty with soft potatoey goodness
it_is too_sweet for_one
maybe they_should call it a_sweet vegetable and_potato plate instead
the_mango_lassi_was averagely refreshing
the_chai was_made the_way i_like_to drink them
it_was made hot
milky and_full_of spice
this_place_is really_good_and very_fresh
i_don't over eat like_a would at a_regular indian_buffet
the_employees are_super friendly_too
delicious_food_and great_prices
i_got_the thali plate which includes entrees and_a_side for
i_chose the_chili_chicken and_lamb_vindaloo for_my entrees and_the_naan for_my side
i_like spicy_food
and these entrees_are both considered
medium hot
which_is why i_picked them
the_dishes did_have a_little kick_to them
more so the_chili_chicken
but i_would_have preferred a_little_more heat
but looking past that
the_flavors_were spot_on
the_sauce for_the_lamb was_extremely flavorful_and great_for soaking up_with_the naan
i also_got a_little taste from_my friends' plates_of the_chicken_tikka_masala_and chicken karahi
and_i'd order them both in_the_future
like_i said
my_only gripe is the_spiciness
since_there aren't many_dishes that_are spicy here
i_wish you_could choose the_spiciness level like many other_indian_restaurants offer
oh_well
as_for_the atmosphere of_this_place
it_is_very casual
just booths and mostly blank walls with_the occasional random wall hanging
they clearly don't_care about the_decor
but_i_don't either as_long as_they continue_to serve quality_food
great little_place
speedy food
fresh taste and_the_chicken momo's
aka dumpling
are_really really_tasty
highly_recommend_this_place if_you_are looking_for fast yummy indian_food
i_had_a chance to_try_this_place out_and surprisingly
they_offer momo's
now some_of you_might wonder what momo's are
so let me_tell you
they_are delicious gifts from god
this_is_a nepali indian fusion offering amazing_food for cheap
highly_recommended
you won't_be_disappointed
went_in today ordered_the_chicken_tikka and_the puloa rice
the_chicken_tikka_was tasty but_a_little to dry for_my_taste
the_rice_was pretty_good
the_next_time_i go_in i_will order the_lamb and_some_of_the items_on_the pre made menu
otherwise can't complain food_is cheap
place_is_clean
not_to shabby
pretty_good food_for what's known as_a fast_food_joint
much healthier than_other fast_food alternatives
naan_was_good
get the_garlic version
tikka_masala_was way good
i_love_indian_food_and the_only indian_restaurant_i knew of was taj_palace around_the_corner
we_have_been going_to island sushi for poke but decided to_try_out om restaurant next door
prices_are awesome
customer service_was_awesome
was_very satisfied_with all_the_food
we_loved the chicken_biriyani and the_tandori_chicken
they_are a_must_try
will_be coming back soon
this_place was_my_first indian_cuisine in_las_vegas
i_ordered_the hot mango_chicken and_the_lamb
the mango_chicken was_spicy just how i_like_it
the_lamb was_very_flavorful
food overall was_excellent
i_thought_the portion_size was_a_little smaller than_what i_am_used_to
living_in america and_all
but_it_was just_enough
will_definitely return
great_place i've_never_had indian_food_before but i_came_here because a_friend told_me it's really_good_and i_work near by i_got butter chicks and hit mango_chicken and basmati_rice_and samosa
like_a potato egg roll lol
they_were_all very_good the_mango chicken_is really_spicy though so be_careful haha but_i will_be_back_for sure butter_chicken and_the_rice_was my_favorite
very simple place
i_like_that when_i want indian_food_i can just come_in order_and it_would_be ready with in_minutes the_price_is fantastic_and the_flavors_are very_tasty
it_is also close_to_my house so thats a_plus
it is_very_clean on_the_inside and the_employees are very_nice
i_will_be_back to_enjoy this great_food
came_in_for a early dinner_with the_family
we_ended_up with_three smaller bowls_of chicken_and_lamb and_two nann bread
food_was_very_good with the_sauces really hitting the_spot with_the_garlic nann
overall
lunch might_be_a better option as_it appears much cheaper
spending bucks i_would_expect a_bit_more than three little bowls_of sauce_and meat
as_the added steamed rice for_another
bummed the_total to bucks
a_bit_too expensive_for what_you_get and where_you eat_it
would_be surprised if_they_are around in months
i_am_giving this_place_a very_generous star
as_i_was thinking it_was_about a
star
it_is nearly a
overall
i_really_enjoy indian_food_and have_had it_in so many_places around_the_world including delhi and bangalore
here is_what_i like
a
fast during_lunch
most_of_the_food in_their special lunch_menu is already prepared and_kept warm
so getting your food_is_very fast
b
selection very simple_and clear cut
all types_of curry_and spice_levels that you_would want
c
the_ambiance very utilitarian in decor
design and feeling
i_don't mind it
but_it_is on_the very inexpensive mode
unlike other_restaurants
d
the_food the_most important aspect
i_love lamb so_we_ordered the_lamb_vindaloo
this_is_my second time ordering this_dish
the_first order time we_came_here
the_lamb_vindaloo was very_mild
this second time
i_asked_for it_to_be hotter and_they said_it naturally was_going_to_be anyway
i_do admit
the_spice was_just_right and_the_lamb_was very_tasty
the_chicken_tikka_masala_was okay
not_too inspiring we_also_had_the alloo goobi and_this_was good
so three dishes between us two
the naan_bread_is darn_good
the_food_is generally pretty_decent
e
service top_notch and_will help you to_order what_you_want
excellent_service
f
why_not star
i_am_not_sure
is_it the paper_plates
is_it the fast foodiness style of_the_restaurant
is_it the utilitarian feel or the_fact_that when_i_am there it is_generally empty
not_sure
the_food_here_is good
the_lamb i_feel is_awesome and_i_will_be coming_back_for sure
gk says
check_it_out
oh_yeah
the_prices_are fantastic for_the lunch_menu
food_itself
for the_most_part
ok
however the_dinner prices_are ridiculous
i_ordered_the combo option with_two curries_and choice if rice naan
very small_portions for almost bucks
the_curries_were quite_good though
the_chicken momos
seemed more_like microwaved gyoza from whole foods than authentic momos
overall pretty disappointed
delicious
flavorful_and a_perfect blend_of_spices
the chicken_biriyani is really_tasty
so_tasty
we_had tikka_masala
lamb_biryani and_some samosas
everything_tasted so fresh_and_delicious
we'll do this again
and_again
first timers here_and we_were_not_disappointed
since we_wanted_to_try different thing's on_the_menu we_decided_to_try thali
choice_of entrees and_a_side
for
for_my entrees i_got hot mango_chicken
chili_chicken and_naan for_my side
my_daughter got chicken_tikka malasa
veggie_korma and_naan
food_was_fresh delicious
portion_size was_just_right and we_were_able_to eat everything
we also_got mango lassi's
they_were_so yummy refreshing
establishment is_clean_and service_was_great
we_will_definitely_be_back
ordered food_for delivery
except_for a_bit_of_a wait everything_was_great
portions were_perfect and_everything showed up warm
will_definitely be ordering from them_again
i would_love to_be_able_to rate this_restaurant
however_i have come_by in two separate occasions and_they_have been closed during their business hours
if i'm_going_to go eat somewhere i_prefer that_their hours of operation be consistent
we_were grabbing cigars next door and_decided_to nosh where_it was_quick_and convenient
they_do thali plates until_pm so we_both decided_to_go with_a entree
side combo
lamb_vindaloo had decent flavor
but it_definitely needed more time stewing as_some of_the_meat pieces were soft
but most were_still chewy and needed time_to break down
unfortunately
we_both selected this_and wish_we differentiated a_bit_more
chicken_tikka_masala_was decent in_flavor
but_it fell in_the_middle as far_as tikkas i've_had_in_the city go
it_was_all breast pieces which for some_people is a_big plus
paneer saag had_a slightly pronounced tamarind like flavor
but_i_was digging the_creamy texture of_this and_they_were generous on the_paneer pieces
we picked rice as_our side and_ordered a_side dish of_garlic_naan
large piece
cut in
which_was crispy_and well_made
if_you_want some fast indian_food
this_is_probably a_good_choice
i'm_not from_this part_of_town so i_don't_think it_would_be something i_would drive across town_for
i_think for_the_price point of_the_two thali_and drinks
i rather go_to_a indian_lunch_buffet for_more selection
apparently they_don't like to_work on saturdays
i_came_here twice on saturdays and both_times they posted a_sign on the_door closed
closed due_to
family emergency
i_would_have forgiven the_fact_that i_drove a_half hour to_check you_guys out but_now i_read in_your reviews that other_people say you_are doing this on_a_regular_basis
not cool
i_ended_up going_to kfc instead and_had_a horrible experience there
i_just gave them_a star_review too they earned it_but i'm_not about_to let_you off_the hook either because if you honored what_you said i_would have_never_been in_that situation
i would've much rather eaten_here
i_think
i_will update this if_i decide to_give your restaurant another shot
i_wanted_to_try and see_if om was_as_good as people have_been saying
however
i'm starting to_feel like_it's a_sign to_not waste my time since om obviously doesn't care_about our business if they're not honoring their posted hours
who wants_to drive all_the_way over_and find_out they are_closed
very unprofessional
especially_for a_fairly new_restaurant trying_to establish their clientele
my advice to_all
call first before_you make a_special trip out
i_thought this_was_a restaurant
but apparently it's_just a hobby
drove half an_hour out_of_my way_to a_sign saying they_were_closed
due_to_a family emergency
reading through other_reviews
this_is_not an isolated incident and apparently happens with a_fair amount of frequency
we_don't live_in a communist country
yet
no_one is mandating your hours
if_you_can't keep your_own business hours
you_should probably change them_to something you_can commit to
if_this were_a one_time thing
i'd_be inclined to_be sympathetic but clearly it_isn't
new
but_not new
we_were here_before
but_it_was_a different place
still indian_food
but apparently under new_management
upon entering the_first_thing that_was obvious was they_were_very busy and_most_of their_customers were indian
that's a_good_sign
as with the_previous place
the_buffet still is very_small
there_were perhaps vegetarian items
and
regular
items
except that included the_desserts
they_didn't even ask_if i_wanted a_menu
they_just said to_go_to_the buffet
i_get_the feeling they_don't like people ordering off_the_menu
the_food_itself was_good
the_goat_curry you wouldn't know it_was goat if it_wasn't labeled
it could_easily have_been beef
but wasn't
for religious reasons
i suspect
the_tikka was_good also
and_they_had a_rice dish_that_was very_tasty
i_think_it was labeled as_a mushroom rice
although_i didn't notice any mushrooms
but_it_was very_nice
they_also_had biryani
and_it_was good_too
all in_all
the_food_was_good
they_are a_bit_pricey
just under for_the_buffet
weekday_lunch
and if_i wanted_a coke it would_have_been extra
though_they did_have the_real sugar coke
when we_were_done paying the_check was_very inefficient
they_don't bring_it to_the_table
you go_to_the register and tell them how_many buffets
and_then
eventually
get_your credit_card and run it
i'm not_sure what_was going_on
but the_group in_front_of me had_a conversation with the_register person
owner
that i_couldn't understand
and_it_took a_long_time before he finally asked_me how_many buffets i_needed to_pay_for
as_i said
the_food_is pretty_good
but for_the_price there_are_better indian_places
because_of_the yelp scale i_have_to rate one
under
but it_was_just barely under
it_seemed pricey to_me for a_simple lunch_buffet
so driving down elliott i_saw this_place and_decided_to stop
we_sat_down
and_the_guy was_so_nice and_attentive
we_shared_the chicken_tikka_masala
it_was sooooo delicious
the_service_was incredible
and_wasn't to pricey
the_spices were_perfect
not too_spicy
i_will_definitely_be_back to_try_their buffet
have_to_say this_is_the_best_indian_food we_have_had in_arizona
service_was incredible with_a waiter who shared information on different_dishes and_their ingredients as_well_as_a history of_the foods
it_is rare that you_can_eat out and_have better_food than home_cooked
prices_were good considering_the excellent quality_of ingredients
so worth_the visit
ask_for james
he is_amazing
i'm_so happy_to have_found aachi
we_have_been so impressed not_only with the_quality_of_food we've_had but_also the_service_and company from_all the_people that work there
james is so_nice_and so knowledgeable about_the_food
i've also_tried the_buffet_and is_fantastic
great_variety
price_and the_flavors
all dishes_are incredible and vegetarian_friendly
we_will_definitely make aachi our number one stop for south_indian_food
we really_enjoy eating_there and we_always feel very appreciated
weekday_lunch buffet
hey hey
it's a_new buffet
stopped_in here_for_lunch today
joined by mike c
jackie c
the_good
this_place features a_comfortable north facing dining_room with_your choice_of booth or table seating
there_were food_items all together
counting salad ingredients separately but_not dressings and garnishes
plus hot indian tea
this_is_a good_selection for an_indian_lunch_buffet
we were_brought dosas
which_are a_treat often reserved for_dinner weekends at_indian_restaurants
the_staff_was_very_friendly and appreciative
yes
there_were_a_few issues
they open at am but weren't ready to_go_for a_few_minutes more
the_staff seemed disorganized for_them having been_open at least days now
i've dined at more_than one much bigger buffet where_i was_their first customer ever and_everything_was perfect
china city in avondale on for example
with_a item presentation and not_a flaw to be_found with the_place
the_same was true of lin's on baseline and china olive in sun city
much_of the_hot food_here_was out at near room temperature
this_is_not ok
even minutes later the_two soups
for example
were barely warm
speaking of soups
there should_have been small melmac or china bowls for_the soupy dishes
not styrofoam cups
china mugs for_the tea would_be more appropriate than styrofoam cups
too
the_flavors_of the_foods were_good
and the_selection balanced
they_just need_to run a tighter ship
so_for now it's stars and_best wishes for aachi southindian kitchen
weekday_lunch buffet
tried_this_place today just on_a whim passing by
i'm_not that much_of an_indian_food fan but thought i'd try something different
and
i_was_quite impressed
i_won't necessarily go_back here_on every visit_to phoenix
but will_go_back again at sometime
my_only gripe
they cut the_chicken into chunks after cooking
this makes_it difficult_to eat without getting chunks_of bone in_your_mouth and having_to spit out
perhaps this_is_the traditional way though
it_was at least tasty
been_wanting_to try_this_place since_it showed up_on my yelp
finally stopped_in last nite
so_delicious i woke up craving_it
the_service_was_also spot_on
they_were_very attentive and_the_price extremely reasonable
will for_sure be_back_to_try more vegetarian_dishes
if you_need a_high dose of spicy_food then aachi is the_spot
food_is_tasty to the_last drop including the_masala induced coconut_chutney and the_onion thoku
a kind of_chutney
ordered the_gobi_manchurian at level not_so spicy_but the_cauliflower was_nice_and crunchy
the_chili paneer at level was_spicy_and the sauciness gave_it the_delicious taste
next ordered_the mysore masala_dosa with extra_spicy chutney giving the deep dark red color
the_sambar accompanied by chutneys_and the_masala_dosa was a_perfect combo to a_perfect south_indian experience
lastly finished the_day with_some madras coffee though doesn't come_in a steel tumbler the taste_is impeccable and a_great_way_to finish the_meal
ambience is_good_and crowd grew stronger at_about pm
definitely a_must go place_and something i_hope i come_back_to again
can't_wait for_my aachi experience round
the_food_is fantastic
i_have beem to_the_lunch_buffet many_times_and love_it
i_just went_for_dinner for_the_first_time
the_food_was woderful as_usual and_the_service_is prompt_and freindly
however
they_were_very frugal with_the yogurt_sauce and mint_chutney
because they_do_not offer_a dinner thali_and it's_a_bit pricey_for what_you_get
i_am less apt to_return for_dinner
it_would_be ideal if they_had_a dinner_buffet
i_will of_course continue_to visit the_lunch_buffet
great_food
food option in lunch_buffet_was awesome
chicken suka masala_with dosa_and idli combination is_super
various delicious dishes for_the_buffet
i_go_to indian_buffets often and_i_have_to_say aachi has more choices and_better dishes than_most
don't complain
the_flavors here_are bright
vibrant and_yes spicy
like many new indian_places they start out_with great_flavor
people complain and_after a_year or_two they start serving the_same mild mush as everywhere else
so please if_you_love good flavors_and spice go_here
otherwise find somewhere_else
this_place_as the_name suggest has south_indian_food
which for_me means dosa's and_a_few new to_me menu_items
we_had_a dosa filled_with a_spicy gobi
cauliflower
it_was_delicious and_yes spicy
my_one gripe is_that for the_soup and_chutneys they_just filled up_some small bowls from the_buffet_line that_was set out for_lunch
we_also_had an eggplant curry_dish that had_a
tangy tamarind and peanut sauce
it_was_good but i_could_not taste_the peanut
as_for_the ambiance it is_decent
not_much different_from the_last indian_place that_was here
tables booths cloth napkins and per dish for_dinner_and lunch_is the obligatory buffet
it's_always a gamble when_you visit a_restaurant on_their opening night
luckily
there_was no
walking away
knowing when to_run
from_me as haveli delivered
i'll be_honest
this_location has_been haunted by former failed restaurants
fitch's
good times
kickshaw
jimmy's
and_their gigantic footprint
in_this case
the_owners did the_right thing and_only used of_the former space
service_was pleasant and_efficient
we_ordered samosas for our_appetizer and_aloo mutter and goat_curry for_our_entrees
while_the filling of the_samosas was_a_little_too heavy for_my_liking
the crust that encased it_was_great
both entrees_were very solid
the_flavors worked well_with one another
i_was particularly impressed_with_the goat_curry
in_the_past at_other_places
the_meat can_be_a_little too
goaty
here_is was_well flavored and fall apart tender
haveli also_has a lunch_time buffet that_i_am eager_to try
still early in it's existence but_if it continues to dish out great_food
i_think_it will_be around to_stay
i_went_here to_try_the_lunch_buffet last saturday and was_impressed
i_have_been a_regular at maharaja for_years
but_i might now be_an even bigger fan of this_indian_restaurant
the_lunch_buffet has a_lot_of great offerings
though the_space around the_buffet_is crowded and could_be opened up more
the buffet_items were_delicious
i_had_an amazing eggplant_dish
the tikki_masala was_so_good
even better_than maharajas
and they_give_you_a choice_of regular nan or coconut nan
the_coconut nan is out_of_this_world
their_tandoori_chicken was_nice_and tender and_not_too dry
also an_excellent dish
i_also_tried their rice_pudding_and mango_lassi which were_both excellent
i_think being_a newer restaurant there_are a_couple_of kinks to_be ironed out like making sure_the buffet_has enough plates_and bowls available
the_staff_was_friendly which_we appreciated
maharaja upped their_buffet prices on the_weekend which i_think was_not their best move and not_only_is this_place more affordable but_i_think has better_food overall
i_will_be_back
my_wife and_i_went_to their_lunch_buffet very recently
the_food_is_good and_the_service_is pretty sweet
not_too outstanding wrt the_food variety but_the tastes would_be super good considering the_price
location is_nice_and it_is_a good fit for_a work day lunch
new_place in fitchburg and_i_must_say i_am pretty excited for_it
we_ordered_the coconut naan_with shrimp korma
i the the_food_was_really_good the only_complaint was_the shrimp_dish seemed_a_little overpriced at
i_would_probably give the_food_and_service stars but the_price_was just a_little_high off_the_menu
the_lunch_buffet said_it_was only
and that_would_be a_steal if the_rest_of their_food_is as_good
the_buffet_was open at_night too but opted_for_the order_off_the_menu
they_even said_i could_get carry_out buffet
pricing for_the_buffet seem much_more reasonable
glad to_have_a seemingly good option_for lunch in_the fitchburg area
i_will update after_i try_it
hopefully it's_a four or five
awesome indian_restaurant good spread for_their_lunch_buffet tasty dishes glad do_not need_to drive all_the_way to madison now
i_hate buffets but_this_is a_solid star buffet
the_buffet area_was constant kept clean_and food was_brought our regularly
they_offer mostly curry_dishes which_is_a huge plus for_me
it varies from chicken
to vegetarian to goat_curry dishes
they_serve cheese and_garlic_naan bread_with the_curries
everything_was delish
i_will_say that_i_was turned off a_bit by_the chicken_curries having dark and white_meat in_it
of_all_the chicken_curries i've_had
they_were cooked_with white_meat only and_being someone who only eat chicken_breast
it_was a_bit_of_a turn down
however
the_sauce and_rice were_great and there_were_some chicken_breast pieces in_the curries at least
we dinned in_a sunday_afternoon where lunch_buffet_was served for
great_price
for_dinner
you_can only order_off of_the_menu
shockingly for_a early sunday lunch
they had_plenty_of customers
wait_staff were_very_friendly and_prompt
interesting note
my_boyfriend_and_i noticed how similar the establishment was_to dhaba indian_bistro out_in middleton
we_asked the_server if there_was_a coincidence and_come to_find_out
they_are_a sister restaurant of dhaba
that being_said
if_you_like dhaba
you'll liked heveli
the_big difference is dhaba doesn't have_a_buffet
while the_buffet_was good
i_think_is enjoy ordering off_the_menu instead
i_will_try that next_time
i_would_recommend heveli's for anyone who loves curry
i_will_be_back to_dine in_the_future
we went_for_the_lunch_buffet
i_am thrilled to_have indian_cuisine close_to work
and_a reasonably_priced buffet
since we_paid in cash
it_was for_people for buffet_with water as drinks
i_thought the_chicken_tikka_masala_was ok
everything_else_was wonderful
i_am looking_forward_to coming_here again with my_family for_dinner
the_food_quality is_good
prove is_reasonable
and_the location_and building is_very_nice
the_staff_was friendly_and_helpful
no wait for_a_quick business lunch
if you're riding on_the bike path
this_is_a_great lunch stop for_the_price
all_you_can_eat and_mango i've cream for_dessert
since_i enjoyed lunch
i_took_my husband_and daughter for_the_buffet on_sunday
all the_staff_were_very kind to my_daughter
and made_us_feel welcome to_bring a_year old who does spontaneous song and dance
since_it_was father's day
several more young families were enjoying their_buffet as_well
i'm pretty_sure they_didn't charge us for_a our kid we_had drinks_and adult buffet trips for
short_of having_a toy area
this_place_was very kid friendly
we_will_be coming again
ordered_an array_of chaat and_a pizza to_share
had_a chocolate croissant and samples of cake
don't_be afraid_to just order
only_complaint_is i_need a translation to_know what_i_am ordering but_with everything tastes so_good it_really doesn't matter
not worth_it
though the_idea is appreciable
taste is_not_that good
its average or below average
people dont have options
and the_shop is trying_to fool it_seems
samosa chat that we_ordered_was not upto the mark
mango mastani also_tried but_it_was also not living upto its name
definitely not_going_to visit anymore the_options that_have on the_list excites you but needless to_say_it disappears when_you taste it
very nice_place
if_you_are_a pastries fan then_i would_definitely_recommend_this_place
lots_of variety_of pastries and chaat snacks
i_have_tried pav bhaji
samosa_chaat and_chicken_tikka pizza
samosas
both big_and irani
and puffs
everything_was good only concern was samosa could have_been_better
the_service_is kind off slow_and we_have to request for_water all_the_time
the_first_time_we visited this_place
the_food_was_really_good
we_ordered_the_chicken puff
egg puff and few pastries
the pastriess were_really amazing_and by_far_the best i_have_tasted in_the_us
now_the not_so good_things
service_is horrible
they dont even serve you water_and you_have_to ask_for it
in spite of asking the_server forgot my_water
not once but twice
service_is extremely slow
the_second_time i_went
the_chicken puff was stale
when_i informed the_manager about_it he_was really not bothered
i_will_go again here only for_the pastries
went to_get takeout
they_forgot to_put my_meal in_the bag
when_i discovered_this later
they_offered to replace and refund
so kudos for_that
but
the cake was flavorless
pros
samosas had_a_good flavor
seemed_to be possible homemade
meal had good_flavor too
will_give them another_chance
went this afternoon with family
place is_still new_and they_still seem_to be figuring out_the operational stuff in_the meanwhile expect quite_a_bit of chaos
possibly spoilt food_and confusing service
we_ordered paav bhaaji
sev puri and paani puri
paav bhaaji was_ok and paani puri potatoes were spoilt
ok
have to_leave now
the fire alarm just_went off accidentally and chaos rules
in_the meanwhile i_get off as_an apology for_the rotten potatoes_in the paani puri
doubt this_place_will be around in months_and will_not miss it either
this_place_is new_and good
pizza and puffs are_delicious
they_don't serve pani puri which_is one drawback compared_to little india
overall its a_nice chaat place and_the cakes are_very_good too
i_made nd visit_to it_and must say_it_was satisfying this_time
ordered paneer_tikka pizza and_mango pastry
must admit both orders_were delicious
all in_all this_is_a new setup and the_owner_is open to recommendations and suggestions
they_need support to_serve the_valley
pizzas and pastries are a_must if you visit_this_place
this_is_an amazing place for_an evening tea_and snacks
my and_my better half come_here quite often
almost every_week
its a_fun little_place and the_guys there are_very customer friendly
not_to_mention
the_place_is very_clean n tidy
ok now coming to_the_food
the chaats are_delicious
helps us_from missing home too_much
good tea_and vada paav
pastries are indian_style which you_cannot find anywhere else in_phoenix

they_did give_me a
sweet lassi
which_was_good also

excellent indian_cuisine paired with great_service_and reasonable_prices made_for a_fantastic evening
i_had_the paneer_pakora as_an_appetizer and_the shai paneer for my_entree and would_recommend both heartily

got terrible food poisoning and diarrhea from_this_place
problem_with these indian_restaurants is_that_they cater an event one evening_and save the_food for_the_buffet the_next_day
very_bad practices that_should be investigated by health and safety officials

why did they close
i_didn't even_get a last dine before_they shut the doors
so sad
just_opened

it_was_too sour and mostly tasted like runny yogurt

they introduced kothu paratha and its_good
lunch_buffet_is pretty awesome
came_in at_the_end_of_the lunch_buffet
there_was not_much left
asked if they_would put_out more chicken_and they_said something_to the_kitchen but_never came_back to_us
the_fish_curry looked questionable so we_didn't try_it
one_of_the curry's had tons_of bits_of bones in_it
and_the_other curry's was_just sauce left
we basically ate_the different_types_of rices and grains then left
awesome buffet
spicier on_the_weekends
yum
food_is_good
the_lunch_buffet_is a_great_way_to get acquainted with fantastic indian_food

first_time_here looks super clean
and_the_guy behind the_counter speaks good english
at_the silverton
enjoying the asian food festival
it's ok
lots_of food to_choose_from_and
rides
i_just think_it is_a_little steep
you have_to_pay just_to get_in
short rib and kimchi bowl at truck norris
it's to expensive
to_get in and_that gets you nothing
it was_supposed_to_be an asian festival but_all they_did was play rap music
really seriously
awesome banquet meal
each
wonderful dinner
flavorful dishes
spicy too
and_very_friendly service
terrible
avoid at_all costs
loved_the place

which had_a_nice kick and_lots_of flavor
pappadum

needless_to say it's_not worth_the_drive or groupon
bad business
go_to_indian paradise instead
oh no they_have closed
they_have_a big downstairs movie room that_would_be perfect_for group meet up
tandoori meat platter is seriously good
it's being your_own wine_and beer
not spirits or soft_drinks
bad_food i_never had_before

delicious_indian_food and_good_service
try_the_buffet and don't_forget to_top_it off with_the chai_tea at_the_end

the_bar is_decent but the_patio is_really_nice
you should_have a_party here
very_nice buffet don't assume the other_table to_be desserts only
asthere are lots_of unnamed sauces_and relishes

perfect way to_finish your_meal

the_dosas are_better to_sit_in than for takeaway delivery
they now have_a liscence
the_owners seem lovely and_the_menu looks so authentic

delicious_food
the_menu_is a_little_bit on_the larger side
however the_staff_is_very

fantastic indian,13
best thing,16
far my,11
food made,13
entr e,10
if there,32
indian dishes,83

but overall,30
for anything,10
aware of,13
vegetarian indian,11
the look,10
might be,46
that said,33

not good,36
and flavor,22
where they,17
way more,10
saffron flavors,15
ice cream,63
masala dosa,54

and the garlic,26
and reasonably priced,12
to tandoori times,13
and the price,20

the best curry,10

not sure why,11
in the bay,11
it was one,11
and the owner,30
options as well,10
great experience and,10
of this place,51
and decided to,24
know how to,24
two of us,13
the selection of,11
was good too,11
was absolutely amazing,10
have the buffet,10
my favorite was,14
said it was,23

to come here,26
best indian restaurant,56

food i've ever,31
like i said,18
and the waiter,18
food is so,22
and service is,21
to have some,12
on the strip,73
indian food in,178
a cup of,11
but i am,25
a lot of,237
since i was,13

to cater to,14
all the great,11
you get to,19
on the other,20
to go to,47

we had ordered,13
was so good,28
but there is,15
dinner on a,11
we had a,108
the waitress was,13
we both had,10
i would be,23
was the chicken,13
a huge fan,30
the rice and,20
the flavors of,10
i tried the,30
i'm pretty sure,13
buffet for lunch,14
and the lamb,32
it did not,10
a bit of,90
the cheese naan,12
was probably the,18
tikka masala with,15
it's not a,15
easy to get,10
a place to,20
a family run,10
the menu has,19
say that the,10
it was an,15
we are in,12
and there was,33
i can't remember,22
i asked if,17
trying to find,13
if it was,32
and the mango,13
best indian food,215
than i expected,15
lunch buffet at,13
hands down the,26
food is good,51
food was absolutely,11
at the end,41
the best thing,15
little bit of,36
of the restaurant,53
i always get,18
because it is,20
for my liking,14
i have been,169
it's hard to,18
to order a,11
spicy at all,14
i must say,29
friend of mine,19
of a restaurant,10
can't go wrong,30
i was pretty,13
i could have,28
had in vegas,16
not going to,19
the dishes were,20
what a great,20
like that they,10
but it wasn't,25
lunch the next,17
if you get,13
and he was,19
of what i,11
the food i,14
paneer tikka masala,21
a few different,11
restaurants in vegas,25
was a tad,11
very impressed with,10
food is very,30
for the first,66
my family and,16
that i didn't,13
and wanted to,17
the naan bread,48
i like that,14
we were all,15
which was really,10
my favorite restaurant,10
up with a,13
staff was very,36
have yet to,20
place if you,14
to get your,15
and meat dishes,10
there is also,12
i would have,92
time i'm in,19
indian restaurant and,16
i don't know,63
a large group,16
been going to,12
get a lot,14
of the night,10
read the reviews,10
but i will,23

to the other,11
very close to,15

one of their,11
at this restaurant,18
are very good,15
not that great,12
need to be,10
have a really,10
and no one,11
looking at the,13
very tasty and,26

side of rice,19
in the restaurant,56
the aloo gobi,17
in the riviera,12
tandoori chicken was,25
mango lassi and,16

good as well,19
the area and,16
was very attentive,19
have to say,52
that i will,13
the indian food,21
i think i,35

the lamb and,11
but i didn't,18
and a nice,17
with plenty of,15
to check it,14
the lamb was,51
good and the,53
but a little,18
it's not the,13
the spice level,28
i have had,83
so we were,15
don't forget to,17
the idea of,14

of the evening,10
to pick up,15
of the curries,16

mango lassi with,10
the restaurant has,15
the items on,13
of indian restaurants,23
the chicken tikki,11
when the food,12
of indian and,10
i recommend the,17
people in the,13
restaurants in town,24
on the outside,31
from the outside,35
think i will,10
been here twice,14
my husband and,82
i don't care,12

the service here,11
come here again,21
been looking for,10
fresh and tasty,19
i tend to,10
and there are,15
is also a,17
of all the,26
which is a,66
food in las,28
is just a,11
was not very,13
where you can,20
husband and i,83
is one of,100
is a plus,10
but i think,37
they also have,57
we had no,10
and lamb vindaloo,12
decor is very,11
they had a,55
but for the,10
me to try,11
really enjoyed it,11
indian food restaurant,15
really good and,19
the main course,17
fresh and delicious,17
at the same,33
like an indian,11
the variety of,17
seems to be,35
the phoenix area,18
was kind of,21
it's a good,11
for us to,19
a while and,10
we were told,14
was very happy,10
so fresh and,10
when i walked,10
in the back,36
variety of indian,12
to see if,23
is warm and,10
to go and,12
restaurants in edinburgh,20
naan was also,12
best indian lunch,14
not too sweet,11
the staff were,29
it's the best,13
if you go,26
my only complaint,23
and the chicken,64
in my opinion,29
place is amazing,11
will be a,15
a friend of,17
we have eaten,12
on our way,12
some kind of,16
going to have,13
indian food before,30
i can see,12
but not the,10
brought out a,10
great as well,16
there was a,80
plenty of vegetarian,10
and has a,17
at indian restaurants,18
a few weeks,22
of the other,31
i don't want,15
go to a,15
the curries were,18
the buffet line,29
to give this,15
they don't have,13
indian places in,11
of the better,16
have to try,19
of my favorites,19
were able to,21
while i was,24
me tell you,13
the lamb vindaloo,49
malai kofta was,15
go back for,13
i thought this,14
i am from,10
cooked in a,12
naan and the,23
worth the drive,10
place is not,12
to do with,15
and that was,19
worth the price,11
and the butter,11
we had chicken,11
in the hawaiian,10
my favorite dish,18
their chicken tikka,20
and the prices,31
would definitely go,18
some sort of,14
try something new,19
was the only,25
dinner for two,11
the same as,10
it wasn't bad,13
we would have,11
but i like,10
came here with,14
i am very,14
las vegas and,17
when we walked,16
for the chicken,12
the quality of,84
loved this place,15
my water glass,10
restaurant in the,49
was as good,10
gobi manchurian is,10
will be coming,18
tasty and the,12
few weeks ago,17
you can eat,43
i think is,10
would be a,33
when we ordered,11
but if you,46
if this is,10
tried a few,11
the parking lot,23
compared to other,14
amount of spice,10
if you're not,14
to die for,56
a nice touch,15
i wish they,13
is hands down,12
a mango lassi,44
most of their,13
it's a great,26
that i have,38
i guess i,10
the size of,20
liked the food,12
the buffet for,11
place is really,11
went for lunch,14
at the bar,11
to the restaurant,18
very polite and,15
lamb korma and,10
for lunch the,15
one of our,22
time i have,11

it took me,10
place was a,11
better indian restaurants,11

we also had,45
buffet in town,18
indian lunch buffet,43
the lack of,33

but the service,39
to do so,10
to be a,78
was prompt and,10
when you are,15
we walked in,30
want to go,13
garlic naan and,60
tikka masala and,101

indian restaurant on,11
in your mouth,19
exactly what i,10
you can't beat,11
to make the,15
all the food,26

make sure you,23
wait for a,14
goat curry and,12
variety of dishes,24

the happy hour,10
but it's a,11
order of naan,11

it was our,12
is a lot,12
on the way,15

not as good,20
and the staff,61
tender and the,10
at india palace,21

and i could,18
blend of spices,12
and i can,12

the service is,172
it's easy to,11
favorite is the,10

the mood for,25
and asked for,13
as i have,13
wish i had,17
take out and,10
and we had,30
over a year,10

that is the,10
mom and pop,10
back to this,26
we'll definitely be,14
the best i,36
only complaint is,16
throughout the meal,10
we were a,17
the menu for,10
i feel like,19
food i've had,39
we were both,14
gave it a,14
was out of,22
i hope they,11
came with the,14
for me and,18
give them a,12
when i go,15
going to be,40
bring your own,11
on the west,14
to see that,15
was worth it,11
too much for,15
just the right,30
lamb was tender,12
i agree with,12
was pleasantly surprised,31
i was on,10
the service was,343
the day we,10
customer service is,11
the entrees were,13
be coming back,32
this is probably,13
where i live,11
decided to give,30
my friend ordered,15
would highly recommend,20
and friendly service,11
i would suggest,11
lunch buffet with,17
top of that,11
more like a,23
the chicken tandoori,17
was extremely friendly,10
and they have,25
so i was,34
the second time,23
is also very,13
i didn't have,20
come back for,12
flavor of the,13
the only reason,22
naan bread is,16
and we all,18
found this place,32
the saag paneer,34
places in the,12
is located in,19
i tried to,12
we had to,67
the nan was,11
you need to,19
bottle of wine,12

with indian food,41
about the place,10

place in town,16
we did not,23
only reason i,10
had a groupon,17
craving indian food,33
on our table,10
our first time,16
i would expect,11
i usually go,11
when it was,12
and want to,11
the main dishes,13
an indian place,16
a while to,16
out of the,78
the buffet and,46
the garlic naan,197
going back to,19
i am not,71
of indian cuisine,22
to las vegas,18
chicken tikka marsala,12
the lunch special,14
i am a,59
except for the,11
a great lunch,12
in all the,13
probably the best,20
that if you,14
this place because,12
service was friendly,17
the manager and,10
restaurant itself is,13
will not be,46
is a large,11
discovered this place,10
